WRITTEN QUESTION E-3749/07 by Ashley Mote (ITS) to the Commission (20 July 2007) Subject: Economics of the madhouse May I congratulate the Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry for his claims in a letter to the Financial Times , published 26 June 2007? His claim that between 1992 and 2006 the economic benefits of EU membership were 2.2 % of GDP is, according to official figures from the British Treasury, less than natural growth of the UK economy over the same period, even with the huge costs of compliance added by the EU itself. And why did he appear to take satisfaction from his claim in the same letter that ‘the administrative burden across the EU 27 [averages] 3.5 % of GDP’, which is significantly higher than the claimed benefit of 2.2 %? Are these figures not a strong economic argument against the very existence of the EU? And if not, why not?
