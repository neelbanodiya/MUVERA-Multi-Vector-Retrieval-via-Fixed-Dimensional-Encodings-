WRITTEN QUESTION E-0994/07 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (2 March 2007) Subject: Electoral constituencies in Germany The federal government in Schleswig-Holstein wants to reorganise the territorial boundaries and abolish the North Friesian constituency although this is a specific area with a specific culture and language protected under the Charter for Regional and Minority Languages. Germany ratified this charter in 1998. These measures will cause the Friesian community to be diluted into a wider area which will cause social and cultural discrimination in the future. 1. Is the Commissioner for language diversity aware of these plans to reorganise the electoral constituencies in Schleswig-Holstein, abolishing the North Friesian constituency? 2. Is the Commissioner aware of the fact that this area has a specific linguistic and cultural character? 3. Is the Commissioner aware of the fact that the North Friesian language and culture is protected on the basis of Chapter II, Article 7.1b of the European Treaty on regional and minority languages? 4. Is the Commission prepared and willing to take action in this case to help preserve the Friesian language? If so, what action will the Commission take? If not, can the Commission explain why no action is needed?
