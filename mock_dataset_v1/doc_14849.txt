WRITTEN QUESTION E-3971/09 by Thomas Ulmer (PPE) to the Commission (5 August 2009) Subject: Theft of coaches in Italy Over the last three years or so, the theft of coaches has become an issue in Italy. In 2009 alone, more than 30 coaches have been stolen there to date. Given that the average value of a coach is EUR 250 000, this already represents a huge level of loss in a single year. Small coach companies are particularly badly affected by the problem, which has put quite a few of them out of business. It would seem, moreover, that when the thieves target foreign coach companies, the Italian authorities carry out only very half-hearted and dilatory investigations. What can the Commission do to improve the protection of property for EU citizens in Member States other than their home country and to ensure equality of treatment in the way that thefts are investigated?
