Answer given by Ms Kuneva on behalf of the Commission (12 June 2008) The Commission is aware that the use of personal music players, either on their own or incorporated into mobile phones, may represent a potential risk of hearing loss. Noise-induced hearing damage by long term exposure above 80‑85 decibels (dB) is a known phenomenon. Such damage can be prevented to a large extent by reducing the exposure levels and duration. The Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC Directive 2006/95/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits, OJ L 374, 27.12.2006. and the Radio and Terminals Directive 1999/5/EC Directive 1999/5/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity, OJ L 91, 7.4.1999. apply a Cenelec standard EN 60065 which currently restricts exposure to 100 dB. Being aware of increasing concern over potential hearing damage from portable sources, the Commission has, therefore, requested an opinion from the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Scenihr) on whether exposure to currently permissible noise levels from music players may cause quantifiable health risks, in particular hearing loss or impairment http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_risk/committees/04_scenihr/docs/scenihr_q_011.pdf . If this is the case, Scenihr would be asked to identify noise levels that would prevent damage to health. While the opinion is still at the draft stage, and was submitted to public consultation in May 2008, it indicates some cause for concern. Scenihr highlights that MP3 player users would exceed the occupational health limits if listening for one hour per day each week at high volume (exceeding 89 decibels). Users listening for longer periods risk a permanent hearing loss after five or more years (approximately 5‑10 % of the listeners). The final opinion is expected for adoption after the summer break 2008. 1. According to the abovementioned draft opinion, about 180 to 250 million portable audio devices were sold in the EU during the last four years, of which about 120 to 170 million were MP3 players; mobile phone sales with an MP3 function were estimated at about 5 million in 2007. The draft opinion, furthermore, estimates that tens of millions of citizens use such audio devices every day. 2, 3 and 4. Once the final Scenihr opinion is
