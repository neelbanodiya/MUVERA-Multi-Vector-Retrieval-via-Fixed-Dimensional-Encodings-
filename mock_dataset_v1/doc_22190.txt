mission, and the creation of synergies should be guiding principles; warmly welcomes that this should be achieved within the existing resources, including internal redeployment, but, at the same time, would like to have some further assurances as regards the medium to long-term implications; Multilingualism 14. Reiterates its wish that equal access to language facilities for members is an essential element of the 2010 budget; is satisfied that an effort has been made from the Administration's side to accommodate this wish but considers that this obviously needs to be combined with the best possible use of resources; 15. Invites the Bureau and Committee on Budgets to urgently address the Inter-Institutional Working Group on multilingualism in order to prepare a proposal (technical level) in order to make sure that inter-institutional cooperation in this field, especially as concerns the use of any free capacity, is improved; is disappointed, for instance, that the system in place for better sharing of translation between institutions is hardly used at all; expects to see a proposal on where possibilities for improvement exist before the first reading; also takes a keen interest in new technical tools for its translation services and asks for information on their development and the related financial consequences during 2010; 16. Asks the Secretary General to provide a cost/benefit analysis regarding the translation in peak times, including the outsourcing to freelancers and an analysis of the possibility of applying alternative working methods; 17. Requests an update on how such resource sharing could be applied in all the fields in which the institutions have temporarily unused capacities, without diminishing the institution's independence and operational capacities (interpretation, renting out the premises, copy services, etc.); Legislation 18. Welcomes the fact that the Bureau's proposal follows up on last year's main priority, namely legislative work, but is of the opinion that the posts suggested need to be further analysed and, as stated above, should be considered within an overall package; welcomes the fact that items linked to legislation, and co-decision in particular, were key beneficiaries of budgetary reinforcements made for 2009; Information and Communication Technology 19. Recalls that clarification has been asked in the IT sector and expects a clear plan for an overall ICT strategy for Parliament, which is crucial in order to make best use of the resources at its disposal; strongly believes that such a plan must be coherent and strike a careful balance between
