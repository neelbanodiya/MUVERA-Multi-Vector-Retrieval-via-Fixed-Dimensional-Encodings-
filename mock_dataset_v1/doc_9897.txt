WRITTEN QUESTION E-3011/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (22 April 2009) Subject: Information on the use of Youth in Action funds by the municipality of Aci Castello For the 2007‑13 Community programming period numerous financing programmes have been drawn up in order to channel EU support towards projects falling under various specific policies. One such programme is Youth in Action, the general aim of which is to encourage young people to embrace active citizenship and, by extension, European citizenship. The municipality of Aci Castello (Sicily, Italy) needs EU funding to promote individual and collective international youth mobility projects based on exchanges and voluntary service abroad, intercultural learning, and initiatives by young people aged between 13 and 30. Can the Commission clarify whether the municipality of Aci Castello has submitted any projects under the Youth in Action programme? If so, could the Commission state whether the municipality of Aci Castello has obtained any financing and if this has been properly used within the specified time-frame, or whether the sums granted have had to be paid back?
