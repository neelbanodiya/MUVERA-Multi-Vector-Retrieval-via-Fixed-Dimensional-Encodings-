in close contact with the Member States and the supplier in the future in order further to improve and harmonise the use of electronic mesh gauges in Community waters. In fact, the Commission has suggested to the CFCA the inclusion of a specific training on the use of the electronic wedge gauge as part of all their training courses for officials and Community inspectors. The new objective mesh gauge addressed in Commission Regulation (EC) No 517/2008 has been accepted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) as the new standard for scientific mesh measurement. Moreover, the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) has presented the principles and methodology of the objective gauge as a draft international standard (ISO/DIS 16663‑1) for adoption by the technical committee. If a qualified majority of Member States considers that the issue should be further discussed, the Commission believes that the subject should be technically addressed at the Expert Group of Control. For the time being Member States control authorities have not expressed any serious concern on this matter since the end of the transitional period.
