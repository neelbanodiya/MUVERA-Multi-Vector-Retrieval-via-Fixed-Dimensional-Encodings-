led the pilot of US1549 to reject air traffic control's recommendation that he fly to the distant Teterboro Airport (simulations indicated that he would have been unable to reach the runway). It also meant that the pilot who made the emergency landing at Okęcie Airport on 1 November 2011 was able to land the aeroplane gently without landing gear while narrowly avoiding overshooting the runway. The list of incidents in which the skills of glider pilots have proved vital in civil aviation emergencies is, of course, much longer than detailed in this question. 1. In the Commission's view, would it not be useful to promote gliding as the standard first step in a pilot's career? 2. Would it agree that glider training ought to be recommended to all airline pilots?
