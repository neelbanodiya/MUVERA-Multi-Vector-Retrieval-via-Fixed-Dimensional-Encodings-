WRITTEN QUESTION P-0450/08 by Eva-Britt Svensson (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (31 January 2008) Subject: Swedish Treaty of Accession to the EU and the Vaxholm judgment Sweden's Treaty of Accession to the EU contains an annex, negotiated and approved by the Commission, which states that Swedish collective agreements shall apply to all labour, Swedish and foreign, working in Sweden. The Vaxholm judgment, however, repudiates this provision. Even though there is no reference at all to Sweden's Treaty of Accession or the annex, the judgment rules that Sweden is prohibited from having the same working conditions for Swedish and foreign labour in Sweden. Paragraph 80 of the judgment (Case C‑341/05) clearly states that Sweden is prohibited from having better terms and conditions of employment than the minimum levels laid down in the EU directive on the posting of workers. According to the Commission, the Court of Justice's ruling in the Vaxholm case is unlawful in that it is contrary to Sweden's Treaty of Accession to the EU (including the annex). Can Sweden apply, pursuant to the annex, for a derogation in respect of collective agreements in the Reform Treaty? If not, was the annex which safeguards Swedish collective agreements simply legal ‘sleight of hand’ with no legal validity?
