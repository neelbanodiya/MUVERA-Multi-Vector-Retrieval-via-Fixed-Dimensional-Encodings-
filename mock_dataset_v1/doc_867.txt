4.1.2003. and Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 773/2004 Commission Regulation (EC) No 773/2004 of 7 April 2004 relating to the conduct of proceedings by the Commission pursuant to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty, OJ L 123, 27.4.2004. have been initiated so far. However, the inquiry is ongoing and issues like the one raised by the Honourable Member fall within its scope. If evidence of any anticompetitive behaviour is obtained the Commission is ready to use all available legal tools to ensure competition in telecoms markets is maintained. Furthermore, the question of users’ rights to use the services of their choice is a major driver for the reform of the EU Telecoms Framework. The Commission is confident that the legislative process will produce a solution which will balance the various interests at stake and promote a thriving and innovative broadband market in Europe. The Commission also notes that the draft Roaming Regulation COM(2008)580 final. which was supported by the Parliament in Plenary session on 22 April 2009 stresses that there should be no obstacles to the emergence of applications or technologies which can be a substitute for, or alternative to, roaming services, such as WiFi, VoIP and Instant Messaging services. The Commission will assess related roaming market developments and report to the Council and the Parliament in 2010.
