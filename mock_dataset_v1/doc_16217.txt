Question for written answer E-001200/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (9 February 2012) Subject: EU funding for the European College of Parma The European College of Parma is a foundation offering a service with a European dimension: its courses are attended by Italian, EU and non-EU students who, on completing their studies, can potentially take up posts in the EU institutions. The College is financed almost exclusively by local authorities and organisations and by the Cariparma Foundation. The Commission makes a financial contribution to the operating costs of the European College of Bruges and of five other European training institutes. Accordingly, can the Commission clarify: 1. its position with respect to the European College of Parma? 2. why it does not contribute to the operating costs of the European College of Parma, on the same basis as it does for the European College of Bruges and five other training institutes?
