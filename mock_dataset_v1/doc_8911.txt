Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (10 August 2011) The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed over the steep increase in the use of the death penalty in Iran, which the Honourable Parliamentarian refers to in his question. As rightly noted High Representative/Vice-President Ashton made a statement in January this year on the ‘wave of executions in Iran’ and called on the Iranian authorities to halt all pending executions immediately and to declare a moratorium on the death penalty. This call still stands. As for the situation of individuals in imminent danger of execution, the EU has on numerous occasions taken direct contact with the Iranian authorities in Tehran and Brussels in order to call for a halt to their executions and for their sentences be commuted. In such cases, the EU also recalls that everyone is entitled to a fair trial, including adequate legal assistance at all stages of the proceedings. On the case of the Kurdish political activist, Mr Sherko Bahman Moarefi (Shirkouh Ma'arefi), who reportedly received a death sentence and was in imminent danger of execution, the EU has appealed directly to the Iranian authorities regarding his case, recalling the EU’s position as set out above.
