has with relatively cheap resources, such as folic acid, obtained positive results in basic healthcare in Iraqi Kurdistan, but that the programme has been without financial resources since March 2006 even though its costs amount only to EUR 100 000 per year? 7. Does the Commission agree that, in view of the consequences of the use of chemical weapons, it is of great importance that victims obtain the best possible treatment, and that to obtain knowledge of the consequences of chemical weapons for public health there needs to be a survey of the population of Iraqi Kurdistan? Is the Commission prepared to take on some or all of the funding for such a programme? What proportion and for what period? Can it give reasons for its answer?
