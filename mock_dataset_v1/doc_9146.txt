overstated by EUR 58 400 000, or 31.4 %; calls on the Commission to explain on a case-by-case basis the reasons for these under-and overstatements; The accounting system of the EDFs 15. Welcomes the introduction of the new accrual-based accounting system (ABAC-EDF) in February 2009 and underlines the fact that the 2009 annual accounts of the EDFs are the first set of accounts which have been prepared using ABAC-EDF; notes that the new accounting system reduces the number of manual adjustments needed and that it strengthens the accounting environment; 16.
