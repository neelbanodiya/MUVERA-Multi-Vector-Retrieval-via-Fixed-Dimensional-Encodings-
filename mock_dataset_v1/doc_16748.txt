Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (6 April 2006) The EU remains committed to contributing to the alleviation of the humanitarian suffering and to the improvement of the economic situation of the Palestinians, whilst at the same time supporting the roadmap principles of building the institutions of a democratic, independent and viable Palestinian state, living in peace and security with Israel. The Commission has recently agreed an emergency package of EUR 120 million in response to the Quartet's statement of 30 January 2006 to address the basic needs of the Palestinian people and facilitate the work of the caretaker government. One half of the announced package will be channelled through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to support its general budget ensuring sustained delivery of essential public services to the Palestine refugees in the areas of education, health, relief and social services. A particular focus of this support will be on children. With regard to the form and extent of overall future EC assistance to the Palestinians, this will depend on the composition and programme of the new Palestinian Government. The Member of the Commission responsible for external relations and European neighbourhood policy has expressed the Commission’s willingness to work with any government that is committed to pursuing peace by peaceful means, to recognise Israel and to respect previous agreements, including the roadmap. Regarding Israeli settlements, the EU position is that Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem are illegal under international law, and that their presence, and expansion, is regarded as not being conducive to the spirit of trust that must prevail between the parties if there is to be progress towards peace. The Commission emphasises this position to the Israeli authorities whenever the opportunity for political dialogue arises, including mention of the humanitarian consequences of settlements for Palestinian communities, particularly children, affected by their presence. The European Union will continue to work closely with the international partners in the Quartet and with partners in the region to assist the parties to the conflict to return to the political process, as laid down in the roadmap, and to promote a resolution to the conflict based on tolerance, respect of democracy and human rights.
