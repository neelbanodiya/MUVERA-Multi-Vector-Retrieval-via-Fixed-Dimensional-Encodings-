whole network in the European Union, including that for passenger rail transport - in both cross-border and national services - in order to boost the transfer of passenger transport from road and air to rail (Amendments 2 and 4). 3. In addition to railway undertakings, the right of access to the network and the consequential right to apply for and be assigned train paths to be extended to other natural and legal persons that have an interest in the use of rail transport services, including in particular shippers and carriers, so as to make optimum use of rail sector infrastructures (Amendments 3, 4 and 10). 4. The proposed opening up of the whole network to international and national freight and to international passenger services should become effective as at 1 January 2006, and, for national passenger services, not later than 1 January 2008, firstly in order to provide all participants in railway operations with a firm time framework for the new framework conditions in the railway sector, and secondly to introduce the opening up of the railway market in good time to ensure that the sector can in fact deliver an effective contribution to creating a balanced relationship between transport operators by the year 2010 (Amendments 4 and 11).
