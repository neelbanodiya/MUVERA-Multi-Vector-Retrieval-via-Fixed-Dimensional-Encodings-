Question for written answer E-7435/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (20 September 2010) Subject: Hotels in Ireland being supported by NAMA Is the Commission concerned that there may be some hotels in Ireland that are being sustained by NAMA, a government scheme, and this is distorting competition? Is the Commission concerned that this risks putting hostels and hotels, which have provided many years of professional service to tourists and which are companies which would otherwise be profitable, out of business, leaving NAMA-supported hotels operated by developers on the market? Does this go against EU competition rules?
