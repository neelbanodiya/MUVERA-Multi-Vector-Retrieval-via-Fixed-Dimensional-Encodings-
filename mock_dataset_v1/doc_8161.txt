Question for written answer E-006136/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (27 June 2011) Subject: Belgian organisation providing financial support to Hamas Investigations conducted over the past 20 years by international law enforcement agencies have found that the al-Aqsa Foundation, which is ostensibly an international humanitarian organisation, in fact provides financial support to Hamas, thus contributing to the USD 10 to 15 million in illegal funding that the organisation receives each year. In 2003 the foundation was listed as a terrorist group by the US and UK Governments, and the governments of countries such as Yemen, Demark, the Netherlands and Germany have taken legal action against branches of the foundation based on their territory. However, the Belgian authorities have failed to take any action against the Aksahum association — the foundation's Belgian branch — despite have been told by its intelligence agencies that the association is involved in providing financial support to Hamas. According to the Aksahum website, the association’s offices in Brussels remain open. Can the Commission provide any further information regarding the Aksahum association’s activities in Belgium and the Belgian Government’s stance thereon? Can it provide information on al-Aqsa activities in other Member States? Should it not take a closer look at the activities of both the Aksahum association and the al-Aqsa Foundation as a whole, with a view to determining who actually receives the funding sent by the foundation to the Palestinian territories?
