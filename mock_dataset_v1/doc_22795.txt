as the main driver; observes that 2 million jobs were created in 2006 and that unemployment fell from 8,4 % to 7,6 %; but notes that structural impediments , in particular the paucity of public and private investment in certain key sectors such as research, education and training , continue to contribute to this unacceptably high level of unemployment and participation in the labour market is still low by international standards; 2. Emphasises that, against the background of the recent recovery, any further raising of interest rates should be undertaken with caution in order not to endanger economic growth; points out that in order to support the economic recovery, Member States must implement both the necessary structural reforms and investment activities; 3. Considers that it is still too early to distinguish the cyclical dimension from the structural one in this recovery; considers, however, that some structural reforms, larger than usually estimated, may have already fed through into growth; deems that such recovery should be taken as an incentive to pursue national reforms adapted to each country, notably in the domain of research, innovation and education, in order to increase the potential for growth of the eurozone; 4. Notes the low growth in labour productivity and considers that it is crucial that wages increase in line with developments in productivity in order to preserve competitiveness in Member States and to allow for job creation in a non-inflationary environment ; stresses however the need for fairer distribution of the fruits of growth; notes that in recent years wage growth has remained below productivity growth levels; calls on shareholders and corporate executives to maintain a responsible policy of remuneration packages and bonuses at the top corporate levels, which tend to grow disproportionately compared to ordinary salary levels, and thus give the wrong signals and discourage support for a responsible wage policy; 5. Notes that the ECB assesses wage development as an upside risk to price stability; recalls in this context that the Commission's Annual Report on the Euro Area 2007 ( SEC(2007)0550 ) makes plain that wages in the eurozone have continued to grow moderately in spite of a sharp rise in oil prices; 6. Emphasises that the Treaty explicitly distinguishes between the goals of price stability and support for general economic policies and that, therefore, the two goals cannot simply be treated as substitutable; 7. Considers that fiscal consolidation is key and
