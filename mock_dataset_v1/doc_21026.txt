Question for written answer E-000092/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (13 January 2012) Subject: Anti-terrorist measures of the EU Member States The European Parliament has called on European Union Member States to submit reports on the economic effectiveness of their anti-terrorism measures and on the impact of these measures on respect for civil liberties and their assessment in terms of democratic control. It then wants to submit this information to the European Commission in order to draw up a Europe-wide evaluation. Precious little has yet been done to objectively assess the extent to which the European Union is succeeding in achieving the objectives set in this area. The European Commission should use its powers enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty to draw up a full and detailed evaluation of these policies. The report should include an overview of spending on online snooping, an overview of measures relating to protection of personal data, an overview of the funding of research to combat terrorism, and an overview of all relevant expenditure. The Commission should also deal with the appointment of an EU anti-terrorism coordinator and his staff. What, then, will the Commission’s next step be in this area?
