Reply (10 May 2010) The EU Delegation in New Delhi has been following closely the situation of the Christian community in India. The Council is not in a position to confirm the Catholic agencies' version of the events referred to by the Honourable Member. A fact-finding visit to Orissa by EU Heads of Mission took place from 2 to 5 February 2010, before the report by Fides was published on 3 March 2010. During this visit, the EU mission had a series of meetings with all stakeholders representing the state government and civil society organisations on the ground in order to assess the status of rehabilitation, reconciliation efforts and the risks of further violence. The EU mission underlined concerns about access to justice for the victims. At the last EU‑India Human Rights Dialogue meeting in New Delhi on 25 March 2010, the concerns raised by the Honourable Member were also addressed. The Indian Government acknowledged that while the necessary legal framework indeed exists, the problem lies rather in the implementation of the law. The Council will continue to follow developments in the situation of Christians in India and is ready to raise the issue at the appropriate level.
