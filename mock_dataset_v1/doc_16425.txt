and isolated by gas stripping. In the sample used, the quantity of non-ionic surfactant should be in the range 250-800 µg. The stripped surfactant is dissolved in ethyl acetate. After phase separation and evaporation of the solvent, the non-ionic surfactant is precipitated in aqueous solution with modified Dragendorff reagent (KBiI 4 + BaCl 2 + glacial acetic acid). The precipitate is filtered, washed with glacial acetic acid and dissolved in ammonium tartrate solution. The bismuth in the solution is titrated potentiometrically with pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate solution at pH 4-5 using a bright platinum indicator electrode and a calomel or silver/silver chloride reference electrode. The method is applicable to non-ionic surfactants containing 6-30 alkylene oxide groups. The titration result is multiplied by the empirical factor of 54 for conversion to the reference substance nonylphenol condensed with 10 mols ethylene oxide (NP 10). 3.2. Reagents and Equipment Reagents are to be made up in deionised water. 3.2.1. Pure ethyl acetate, freshly distilled. 3.2.2. Sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO 3 AR. 3.2.3. Dilute hydrochloric acid [20 ml concentrated acid (HCl) diluted to 1 000 ml with water] 3.2.4. Methanol AR, freshly distilled, stored in a glass bottle. 3.2.5. Bromocresol purple, 0,1 g in 100 ml methanol. 3.2.6. Precipitating agent: the precipitating agent is a mixture of two volumes of solution A and one volume of solution B. The mixture is stored in a brown bottle and can be used for up to one week after mixing. 3.2.6.1. Solution A Dissolve 1,7 g bismuth nitrate, BiONO 3 .H 2 O AR, in 20 ml glacial acetic acid, and make up to 100 ml with water. Then dissolve 65 g potassium iodide AR in 200 ml water. Mix these two solutions in a 1 000 ml measuring flask, add 200 ml glacial acetic acid (3.2.7) and make up to 1 000 ml with water. 3.2.6.2. Solution B Dissolve 290 g barium chloride, BaCl 2 .2H 2 O AR, in 1 000 ml of water. 3.2.7. Glacial acetic acid 99-100 % (lower concentrations are unsuitable). 3.2.8. Ammonium tartrate solution: mix 12,4 g tartaric acid AR and 12,4 ml of ammonia solution AR (d = 0,910 g/ml) and make up to 1 000 ml with water (or use the equivalent amount of ammonium tartrate AR). 3.2.9. Dilute ammonia solution: 40 ml ammonia solution AR (d = 0,910 g/ml) diluted to 1 000 ml with water. 3.2.10. Standard acetate buffer: dissolve 40
