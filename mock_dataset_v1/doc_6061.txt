WRITTEN QUESTION E-0763/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (1 March 2005) Subject: Selection by interview of public servants in Greece On 15 February 2005 the Greek Parliament adopted a new legislative provision (Article 4(2) of the ‘Public and Municipal Servants’ Act) concerning the selection of the country's future public servants by the central recruitment board (ASEP) principally on the basis of interviews. Under this provision, the ASEP may, for the purpose of conducting such interviews, set up selection panels, including ‘individual scientific experts’ who are apparently not required to have (previous or present) public sector experience, despite the fact that they are being called upon to assess public sector candidates. The interview constitutes the principal factor in the final grading of candidates on the basis of an arcane mathematical formula to be used by the ASEP which then awards marks on a relative scale rather than as the basis of an absolute and pre-established system of maximum levels common to all candidates sitting the same competition. Can the Commission say which competitions it organises through the EPSO (aside from the selection of directors) include on the selection panels ‘individual scientific experts’ (presumably excluding former or retired EU officials for example)? Is the interview the most important element in grading candidates? If the EPSO does proceed in this way, are marks awarded on a relative scale or on the basis of an absolute system of maximum levels established at the outset?
