December 2003. In order to guarantee that the return, the readmission and the reintegration in the families of the non accompanied minors is organised in full respect of the rights of minors up to the age of 14 included, the beneficiary organises cooperation between the competent institutions of the Government of Morocco (l’Entraide Nationale) and the relevant services of the Municipality of Madrid. This cooperation of the parties involved takes the form of an ad-hoc Committee for non-accompanied minors with the following mission: — establish a programme of cooperation and exchange between the two parties in order to guarantee that the returns are voluntary and not contrary to the higher interest of the child; — safeguard the rights of minors as foreseen in the International Convention of the Rights of the Child and in the international and community rules concerning refugee children; — inform and involve the families of these minors in order to guarantee that the voluntary return permits sustainable family reunification and social reintegration in the country and family of origin. There will be no involuntary expulsion of non accompanied minors. The project will reunify Moroccan minors with their families, under the supervision of the Spanish Attorney-General and the Moroccan authorities, responsible for the protection of minors. Therefore the Commission consider that the project is in conformity with the Convention of the Rights of the Child of 1989 and the principles of international law.
