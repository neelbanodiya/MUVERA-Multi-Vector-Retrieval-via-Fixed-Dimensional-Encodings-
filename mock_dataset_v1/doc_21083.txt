Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (9 February 2012) 1. In order to thoroughly assess the issue of airline bankruptcy, its impact and relevance for enhanced protection measures for passengers, the Commission has been working on an in depth preparatory study. The study is available on DG MOVE's website http://ec.europa.eu/transport/passengers/studies/index_en.htm . A stakeholder's workshop was also organised in 2011 to receive feedback from stakeholders on the study and to discuss the identified policy options. The Commission intends to finalise its analysis of the issue in 2012. 2. The Commission is committed to ensure adequate passenger protection in case of airline insolvency. It will apply the proportionality principle through the Commission's policy on Smart Regulation, which calls for regulation only where there is a need for it. However, no decision has yet been reached as to whether a voluntary scheme is able to ensure the necessary level of passenger protection. 3. The Commission is considering the possible linkage between the airline insolvency issue and the revision of the Package Travel Directive. The two projects are certainly being coordinated with a view to ensure adequate consistency.
