their rights with regard to pension schemes, especially those relating to cross-border activities and mobility; 13. Calls on the Commission to submit concrete proposals for increasing transparency in relation to pension schemes; 14. Stresses the importance of sound financial education from an early stage; 15. Calls on Member States to strengthen the access of SMEs, in particular micro-companies and individual service providers (such as freelancers), to pension funds; 16. Welcomes the establishment of national tracing systems for pension rights from different sources in all Member States, and calls upon the Commission to submit proposals for a European tracing system; 17. Notes that the EU should not only improve all pension rights of mobile workers but also ensure that they have access to reliable data to make an informed decision before moving abroad; calls for individuals to have a right to information concerning the countries, sectors and products in which pension funds invest their assets; 18. Calls on Member States which have not already submitted concrete plans with clearly quantifiable and time-defined milestones and targets on how to strengthen their pension system to treat this matter urgently, so as to enable consumers and citizens to have a clear understanding of what their future pensions will consist of; Cross-border rights 19. Emphasises that to meet citizens’ expectations as regards the Union’s internal market, ideally all pension rights should be portable within the EU; points out that, currently, the portability of statutory pensions is established in European law, but needs to be improved, and that nothing has yet been done with regard to the second pillar; 20. Stresses that, in order to improve cross-border mobility for workers within the internal market, obstacles to the possibility of transferring pension rights to the first two pillars must be removed; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the Member States, to provide better information concerning both the possibility of transferring pension rights and applicable labour law, insurance rights and workers’ rights; 21. Calls on the Commission to examine in depth the obstacles to portability; takes the view that any action on removing obstacles to mobility, such as tax discrimination against cross-border life insurance payments, should concern all work-related pension schemes in every Member State, independent of how these schemes are embedded in national pillar structures; asks the European Commission to define general principles with sufficient flexibility for the Member States to accommodate them within their own
