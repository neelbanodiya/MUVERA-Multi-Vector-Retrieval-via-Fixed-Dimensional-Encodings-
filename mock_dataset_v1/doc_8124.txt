Question for written answer E-4699/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (25 June 2010) Subject: Aid to preserve the Almendres Cromlech and establish a ‘Megalithic Way’ in Portugal and Spain The Almendres Cromlech, in Évora, Portugal, is a heritage asset of unquestionable importance, not only at local level, but also within the wider regional context; indeed, it is considered to be the Iberian Peninsula’s foremost megalithic complex in terms both of its size and of its state of preservation. As well as this complex, there are two other smaller settlements in the same part of Alentejo, namely the Gates of Mogos Stone Circle and the enclosure at Vale María do Meio. Megalithic monuments are likewise to be found in other municipalities in Alentejo, including Montemor-o-Novo, Monsaraz, and Mora. Furthermore, there are traces of megalithic settlements in several places in the neighbouring Spanish region of Andalusia. All these monuments are encompassed within a great European Atlantic front extending also to other countries, for example France, Ireland, and Denmark. In spite of its historical and cultural importance, the Almendres Cromlech needs urgently to be restored and developed in order to contain the threat of degradation now hanging over this precious heritage site. To that end, studies have been conducted by appropriate authorities, but the necessary funding has still to be allocated to enable action to be taken along the lines proposed. In the light of the foregoing, 1. From what sources could support be provided for the necessary revitalisation and development of the Almendres Cromlech? 2. What forms of support could be provided with a view to establishing a ‘Megalithic Way’ in the regions of Alentejo and Andalusia, including measures to protect and enhance the heritage assets, the aim being to enable them to be enjoyed by the public and to exploit their educational and tourism potential to the full?
