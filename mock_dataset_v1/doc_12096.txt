Multiannual penalties for overfishing should be regulated by means of a Council Regulation. Amendment 7 5 Proposal for a regulation Article 97 – paragraph 1 – table Text proposed by the Commission Extent of overfishing relative to the permitted landings Multiplying factor Up to 5% Overfishing * 1.0 Over 5% up to 10 % Overfishing * 1.1 Over 10% up to 20% Overfishing * 1.2 Over 20% up to 40% Overfishing * 1.4 Over 40% up to 50% Overfishing * 1.8 Any further overfishing greater than 50% Overfishing * 2.0 Amendment Extent of overfishing relative to the permitted landings Multiplying factor The first 10% Deduction = Overfishing x 1,00 The next 10% up to 20% in total Deduction = Overfishing x 1,10 The next 20% up to 40% in total Deduction = Overfishing x 1,20 Any further overfishing greater than 40% Deduction = Overfishing x 1,40 Note : The percentage intervals shall be replaced by the intervals set in Article 5(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 of 6 May 1996 introducing additional conditions for year-to-year management of TACs and quotas. Justification As regards the table of penalties, those expressed in percentages do not properly reflect the situation regarding quotas exceeded. This is the case in particular for deep-water species, where, for some Member States, the quotas are limited to small quantities that may even be less than 30-50 tonnes. Amendment 7 6 Proposal for a regulation Article 97 – paragraph 1 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment 1a. If the quota, allocation or share of a stock or a group of stocks allocated to a Member State does not exceed 100 tonnes, the reduction for exceeding the quota shall be applied in a linear manner and not by percentage, except for species covered by a multiannual plan to which paragraph 1 shall apply. Justification In the case of relatively low quotas for certain species, the overfishing may take place in a very small number of waters or be caused by very few vessels. The application of the percentage system envisaged in such cases may lead to the immediate closure of the fishery causing irreparable damage to the other vessels. A linear system would be much fairer in such instances. Amendment 7 7 Proposal for a regulation Article 97 – paragraph 2 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment 2. If a Member State has repeatedly overfished its quota,
