Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (4 June 2008) The Commission is aware of the report on Cyprus published on 15 April 2008 by the Council of Europe's Committee for the prevention of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (CPT). The Commission recalls that there is currently no specific European Union legislation in the area of the treatment of detainees. The Commission is, however, conducting a study on minimum standards in pre-trial detention procedures and the arrangements for regular review of the grounds for detention covering all Member States. The Commission is of the opinion that enhancing standards in the area of detention, both pre and post-trial, is important for the strengthening of mutual confidence and the smooth functioning of the area of freedom, security and justice.
