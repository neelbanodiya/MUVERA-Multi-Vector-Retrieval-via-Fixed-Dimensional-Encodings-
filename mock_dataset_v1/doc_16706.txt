Answer given by Mr Potocnik on behalf of the Commission (4 January 2005) In reply to the first and second questions – the results found in two laboratories indeed largely correspond to those referred to by the Honourable Member. However it should be noted that since these findings were obtained in in vitro studies, it cannot be concluded that comparable genotoxic effects will also generated under in vivo conditions in humans and animals. In addition, it should be noted that these results were found in two REFLEX (Risk Evaluation of potential environmental hazards from low energy electromagnetic field exposure using sensitive in vitro methods) laboratories, but could not be confirmed in a partial replication study in a third REFLEX laboratory. This must be investigated in further experiments. A preliminary comprehensive assessment of risks to consumer safety or public health should be completed in order to properly tackle this issue. As to the questions three, four and five of the Honourable Member, the Final Report from the project Consortium was sent to the Commission on 29 November, 2004. It was delayed because the 12-partner Consortium had not agreed a version acceptable to all of them due to the different results mentioned above. The scientific results of this project are already available (with the usual practice for EU funded projects) through peer-reviewed scientific journals. The Honourable Member will find a list of already published or accepted articles stemming from the REFLEX projects in the annex sent directly to her and to Parliament’s Secretariat. Regarding question six on the conclusions to be drawn and action to be taken on the REFLEX, the Honourable Member is kindly referred to Commission’s answer to a previous question on the same matter written question E-1589/04 by Mr Brie, OJ C… .
