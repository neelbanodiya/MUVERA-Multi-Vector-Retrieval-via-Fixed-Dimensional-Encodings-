Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) The Commission does not foresee an investigation into the allegations mentioned by the Honourable Member, as it has neither the legal competence nor the administrative capacity to do so. The Commission would reiterate the answer provided to the same question by the Honourable Member under E‑3497/08 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E‑2008-3497+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN. : ‘Stability and security in Iraq remains a serious concern despite reports of overall improvement over the last months. The ethnic and sectarian violence that has been affecting Iraq for many years and which peaked after the 2006 February bombing of the al-Askari shrine in Samarra is particularly worrying. The EU has repeatedly urged all parties in Iraq to refrain from violence and seek political solutions through national reconciliation and national dialogue.’
