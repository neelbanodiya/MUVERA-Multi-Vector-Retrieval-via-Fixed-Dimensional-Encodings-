their own rules to protect citizens, but leaving the authorities with jurisdiction to intervene where guarantees do not appear to be sufficient (the Member States have to monitor the system directly in order to ensure that the rights laid down are respected). The method chosen by the Commission to achieve its target is to be welcomed: calls for volunteers, the system already applied successfully in the USA, make it possible to minimise inconvenience, although it leaves the operators to bear the costs. The level of financial compensation fixed by the Commission seems, however, excessive for the airlines, which are already experiencing difficulties, and may well, paradoxically, increase prices, which would clearly be to the detriment of all passengers. Therefore, the rapporteur proposes a reduction in amount and a three-category division for compensation, which is more in line with the reality of European flights (see Amendment 21). In addition, while it seems acceptable to equate the prejudice suffered by a passenger denied boarding and one who has not received any advance information about cancellation, delays should not be treated in the same way. Handling such delays according to the system set out in Article 9 would give rise to a state of paralysis both because of the chain reaction which it would set off and because of the difficulties involved in quickly identifying who was responsible for the delay (heavy air traffic, carriers etc.). On the other hand, aircraft safety, both from a technical point of view and from an external point of view (possible attacks or sabotage) is a priority which must not be neglected (see Amendment 19). For these reasons, the rapporteur also proposes that a distinction be clearly drawn between the roles and responsibilities of marketing carriers, tour operators selling a package and operating carriers (Amendment 7). In particular, some changes to take into account the particular characteristics of tour operators are suggested (Amendment 10). 16 July 2002 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRONMENT, PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONSUMER POLICY for the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights ( COM(2001) 784 – C5‑0700/2001 – 2001/0305(COD)) Draftsman: Phillip Whitehead PROCEDURE The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy appointed Phillip Whitehead
