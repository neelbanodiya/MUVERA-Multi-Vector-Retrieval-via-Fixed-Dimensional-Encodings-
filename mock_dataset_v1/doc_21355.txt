WRITTEN QUESTION E-3593/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (12 October 2005) Subject: Press reports concerning bribery of a minister in Greece Michel Josserand (a former executive of the ‘Thales’ company) reported to the French newspaper Le Monde that his company (which failed to be awarded the contract by the Greek Government for the Olympic Games security system) managed to offset that loss in part through orders received from the Greek armed forces, in particular under the programme for upgrading the Greek navy's frigates. Mr Josserand is reported as saying that ‘we managed to bribe a government minister in 2003 and we were therefore able to receive orders from the armed forces’. What is the Commission's position on these (very serious, albeit as yet unsubstantiated) accusations? Over and above the extremely serious moral issue raised vis-à-vis politicians, should, of course, these accusations prove to be true, has the Commission considered that the conditions are created for unfair competition when companies manage to gain privileged access to public contracts by ‘greasing the palms’ of high-ranking politicians? How can the Commission enforce total transparency in public procurement and ensure that there are safeguards against the type of occurrence described above?
