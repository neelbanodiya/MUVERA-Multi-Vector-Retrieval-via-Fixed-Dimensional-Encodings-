budgeting has still not been implemented; notes that, in accordance with the principles set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has examined a range of Community policies and measures from the point of view of equal opportunities and the protection of women's rights; in this connection, notes that gender mainstreaming should not only apply to specific measures designed to promote equal opportunities, but should also extend to the defence of the position of women and women's rights in the context of all budget items; 4. Stresses that under Article 3(2) of the EC Treaty, the promotion of gender equality is a fundamental objective of the Community and should be respected in all Community activities; stresses further that the Commission must ensure that gender equality is taken into account in the implementation of the budget and that any action should be evaluated from the perspective of the difference of its impact as between men and women; 5. Stresses that the Commission should develop a monitoring and evaluation system that shows the effects on men and women of various budget lines in implementing the principle of gender equality, i.e. demonstrates both how budget expenditure has taken into account gender equality and what projects have been financed to achieve this objective and which budget items make particular provision for expenditure for the promotion of gender equality and the protection of women's rights, especially in the fields of self-employment and social protection; 6. Points out that in view of the similar objectives already implemented in budget lines in previous years, as proposed by its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the proposals for the 2006 budget aim mainly at attaining those objectives; 7. Acknowledges the fact that the preliminary draft budget proposes an increase for some of the budget lines concerning gender equality and the protection of women's rights along the lines of the position taken last year, and is looking forward to the evaluation report on these financial instruments that will be published in 2005; 8.
