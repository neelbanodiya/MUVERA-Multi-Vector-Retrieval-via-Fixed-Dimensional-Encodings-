WRITTEN QUESTION P-6735/08 by María Isabel Salinas García (PSE) to the Commission (12 December 2008) Subject: Integrated production Integrated production is the sustainable system of agriculture and animal husbandry for food production that uses natural resources and regulatory mechanisms to take the environment and social needs into account, thus ensuring that agriculture is viable. There are no regulations at Community level on integrated production even though a consensus exists among countries and regions with their own legislation on developing a European guarantee framework. Does the Commission think it useful and necessary to have a single standard and a single quality designation for integrated production at Community level? What measures does the Commission intend to take with respect to integrated production, given its increasing use in European agriculture?
