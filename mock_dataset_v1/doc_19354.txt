Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (11 September 2006) The Commission does not have data to support the claim that 600000 Polish citizens have emigrated to the UK, nor does it have information as regards the number of people having emigrated in certain professions, such as anaesthetists. In its report on the functioning of the transitional arrangements COM(2006)48 final. , the Commission pointed out that flows from the EU‑8 had been fairly limited in relation to the overall working age population and that these are driven by factors related to supply and demand conditions, both in the sending and receiving countries. The report also indicates that, rather than seeking permanent employment in another country, a significant percentage of migrant workers stay in the receiving country for a fixed period only. Consequently, migrant workers often return to their country of origin, which will benefit from the experience gained abroad. The Commission will continue to monitor mobility flows within the EU and invite Member States to provide information on workers mobility.
