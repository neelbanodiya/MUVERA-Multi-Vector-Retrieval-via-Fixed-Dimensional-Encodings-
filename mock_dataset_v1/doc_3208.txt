Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2009) The ‘common values’ mentioned in the Joint Declaration issued during the EU‑Ukraine Summit on 9 September 2008 include respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as the rule of law and democratic principles. Naturally, acts glorifying or promoting fascist ideologies would run entirely counter to these principles. The Commission raises issues related to respect for human rights in the course of its regular dialogues with Ukrainian counterparts.
