Question for Question Time H-0586/2010 to the Commission Part-session: December 2010 Rule 116 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) Subject: Secret negotiations between the EU and Turkey According to an article in the Turkish newspaper Milliyet, ‘secret negotiations’ are taking place between the Commission and Turkey with a view to opening Turkish ports to Cypriot ships and opening Ercan airport, which is in the occupied part of Cyprus, to flights from the European Union. Can the Commission deny or confirm this? If negotiations are in fact taking place, is there a link between the separate obligation for Turkey to open its airports and ports to Cypriot vessels and the opening of Ercan airport to flights from the European Union? What is the Commission’s view of opinion JURI_AL(2010)450882 of Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, which states that the entire island of Cyprus is part of the EU customs union and that, therefore, legislation on this issue cannot be based on the common commercial policy since that 'would imply that de facto the line separating the territory of Cyprus would be tantamount to an external border of the Union’? Does it intend to follow the committee’s opinion?
