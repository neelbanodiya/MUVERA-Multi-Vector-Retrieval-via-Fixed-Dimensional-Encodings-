Welcomes the Commission's Communication and emphasises that new approaches are needed to research and development in nanosciences and nanotechnology (N&N); 2. Stresses the importance of N&N for the Lisbon Strategy and notes that they can contribute to EU competitiveness and sustainable development objectives; 3. Emphasises the need to promote better public understanding of N&N, especially among young students, in order to increase scientific vocations in the EU; 4. Welcomes the consultation conducted for this proposal and encourages the Commission to continue improving its work in order to respond to the increasing demand for better regulation; 5. Emphasises the need to respect high ethical principles and welcomes the planned reviews on issues such as non-therapeutic human enhancement and links between N&N and individual privacy; expects the reviews to be public and to include a thorough analysis of nanomedicine; 6. Shares the Commission's view that protection of intellectual property rights (IPR) in the field of N&N is essential for innovation, both in terms of attracting initial investment and ensuring future revenue; calls on the Commission to develop standards for the protection of IPR and models for licensing agreements; 7. Regrets the fact that patenting of N&N inventions in Europe is developing slowly; calls on the EU to create a N&N patent monitoring system governed by the European Patent Office; 8. Encourages general reforms in the field of the European patent system in order to cut costs of patenting
