Question for written answer E-011919/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Iva Zanicchi (PPE) (15 December 2011) Subject: Budget support for emerging markets shortly to be withdrawn The Commission intends to withdraw its budget support for emerging markets such as Brazil, China, India and Argentina by 2014. Humanitarian aid will then focus on the world's poorest countries, while the newly industrialised countries could benefit from other EU programmes. The reform will apparently focus development aid on areas such as sustainable agriculture and renewable energy. At the same time the Commission would like loans and funding at special interest rates to be granted in a more effective and targeted way. What does the Commission say to those NGOs — including Action Aid — which are sceptical in supporting this new strategy and point out that the absolute majority of the world's poor people currently live in emerging market countries?
