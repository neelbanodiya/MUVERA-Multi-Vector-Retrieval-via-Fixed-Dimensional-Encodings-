Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (9 September 2005) Greece is characterised by large persistent public finance imbalances that need to be corrected as soon as possible. The Greek economy has enjoyed robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth since 2001. Real GDP growth in 2001‑2004 has been 4.25 % on average and, at some 3 % according to the Commission 2005 spring forecast, it is projected to outpace the euro-area average in both 2005 and 2006. Moreover, the Greek output gap for 2004 was sizeably positive at 2 % of GDP and is projected to narrow only slightly in 2005‑2006. This favourable macroeconomic scenario makes it even more imperative to quickly correct the excessive deficit before any economic turnaround makes the consolidation more difficult. In contrast, in Portugal, the current cyclical weakness is gloomier with GDP growth averaging 0.5 % between 2001 and 2004, with a recession in 2003, and subdued prospects for the coming two or three years which result in a negative output gap close to 3 % of GDP. Clearly, the circumstances are such that the correction has to be envisaged in a medium-term framework, as too large an effort in a very short period would risk jeopardising the tentative economic recovery. Another important factor incorporated in the decision-making process has been Greece’s general government gross debt as a percentage of the GDP. Greece’s debt ratio, which stood at 110.5 % of GDP in 2004, is the highest in EU‑25 and needs to be reduced as a matter of urgency. In Portugal, on the other hand, the government debt ratio, while in excess of the reference value, is considerably smaller. In addition, in the case of Portugal, the year of identification (2005) and the year of occurrence of the excessive government deficit (2005) coincide, given that the identification is made on the basis of planned data and not actual data, which become available only in the subsequent year. Such an early identification of an excessive government deficit and the subsequent expedited procedure have also been taken into account.
