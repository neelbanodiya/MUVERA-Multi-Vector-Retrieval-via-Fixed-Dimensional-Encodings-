of young professionals into the sector, and to provide adequate funding in order to ensure the full implementation and success of those programmes; 27. Further requests, in this context, that the necessary publicity be given to the action taken, so as to ensure that comprehensive information on training opportunities is readily available to all interested parties; 28. Believes that any new inshore fisheries legislation must pay special attention to the need to establish and maintain a safety culture in which safety is given the highest priority, and to ensure that safety rules appropriate to the inshore sector are properly implemented; insists that such a safety culture must start by ensuring a more secure and modern fleet with the capacity to include new safety equipment and material, it being necessary to this end to continue with the granting of aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet under the future EFF, as already approved by Parliament; 29. Recognises that women play a major role in the inshore fisheries sector, notably in the areas of management, sales and marketing, aquaculture, processing and research; 30. Believes that women's networks can make a major contribution to the socio-economic development of fisheries-dependent communities, and notably coastal communities; 31. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take systematic account of the gender dimension and gender equality when dealing with any of the situations and problems linked to inshore fishing and in pilot projects financed by the CFP and the structural funds, since this type of fishing is characterised by an economic structure which is chiefly based on small family firms, where women play a fundamental role which should receive legal and social recognition; 32. Takes the view that the changes which are occurring in communities that depend on inshore fishing affect women both directly and indirectly and therefore calls on the Commission to lend its support to specific projects which have as their objective the recognition, promotion and diversification of women's role in fisheries-related areas and to adopt solutions, with a view to the diversification of activities and the restructuring of such communities, that not only enjoy the support of local, regional and national governments and the European Union but also benefit from equal participation of men and women; 33. Urges the Commission firstly to gather and analyse gender-differentiated data on inshore fishing and secondly to identify and propose solutions to the specific
