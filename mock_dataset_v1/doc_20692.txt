strict. The flexibility proposed by the Commission should not, however, undermine the authority of International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and the effectiveness of its supervisory bodies, and I have suggested an amendment in this respect. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT 1. In accordance with the guidelines adopted in June 1994 for the period 1995 to 2004, the Community adopted at the end of 2001 Regulation No 2501/2001 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2004. This latter date will see the expiry of both the ten‑year guidelines for the period 1995 to 2004 and of the last implementing Regulation for the years 2002 to 2004. 2. The new ten‑year guidelines and their first implementing Regulation should normally enter into force on 1 January 2005, and therefore adopted in 2004 at the latest. Taking into account that the wider framework of the GSP is that of the WTO, and given that the round of multilateral negotiations launched in Doha in November 2001 will not be completed in time for this timetable to be kept to, it is proposed to defer adoption of the ten-year guidelines to a later date and simply to renew the current Regulation No 2501/2001 for one year, namely 2005. 3. The rapporteur agrees with this approach but would like to obtain a guarantee that the consultation process for the new ten-year guidelines and their first implementing Regulation can be started sufficiently in advance to allow for a proper involvement and consultation of partner countries, EU institutions, including the European Parliament, and non-state actors. An amendment in this sense has been proposed. 4. Apart from extending the validity of the Regulation, the Commission proposes to include a change to the annual adjustment of the offer by graduation. The Commission proposes to modify the graduation mechanism in order to exclude, in a non-discriminatory way, all beneficiary countries accounting for less than 1% in value of GSP imports. In practice, this will focus the effects of graduation on the principal GSP beneficiaries, a dozen countries accounting for the bulk of GSP trade According to the statistics provided by the Commission, the list of countries subject to graduation next time (1 January 2006, or 1 January 2005 if it is decided to bring forward application of this new clause) is: China, Russia, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Vietnam.
