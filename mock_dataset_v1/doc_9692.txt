WRITTEN QUESTION E-2763/06 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Council (21 June 2006) Subject: Council Directive 2004/83/EC on minimum standards for qualification as a refugee What is the Council's response to the criticisms that the definition of a refugee in Council Directive 2004/83/EC OJ L 304, 30.9.2004, p. 12 . on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third‑country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted, is limited to a ‘third‑country national’ or a ‘stateless person’ rather than any person and that, in relation to the provisions concerning protection, the subsidiary derogations included in Chapter VII on the content of international protections differentiate between those with refugee status and those with subsidiary protection, thereby allowing Member States to withhold rights, or grant significantly lower levels of rights, to beneficiaries of subsidiary protection? This is of particular concern in relation to benefits afforded to family members, the duration of residence permits, the provision of travel documents, entitlement to social welfare benefits, and access to healthcare, the employment market and integration facilities.
