Question for written answer E-7330/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oriol Junqueras Vies (Verts/ALE) (15 September 2010) Subject: Flat-rate tolls for sections of motorway The introduction of a flat-rate toll following the construction of the ‘second ring’ on the A-8 motorway at San Sebastián/Donostia is a clear example of discrimination and lack of proportionality in setting fees. According to the study carried out by the Diputación de Gipuzkoa, 20 % of drivers using the AP1/A‑8 will have to pay a certain amount for use of the section corresponding to the ‘second ring’ even though they are not going to use it. At present, vehicles that do not use this section have to pay the toll nonetheless and those that use it only once have to pay twice over. In response to this inexplicable situation, the Diputación de Gipuzkoa has decided that vehicles fitted with an automatic toll transponder carrying out return journeys within 48 hours are not charged for one of the journeys. This puts users who do not make the two journeys within that period of time and who do not have this device at a comparative disadvantage. Does the Commission consider this to be in accordance with the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination laid down in Directive 2006/38/EC OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 8. on the charging of heavy goods vehicles? Is this flat-rate toll compatible with the road transport pricing schemes that the Commission considers acceptable?
