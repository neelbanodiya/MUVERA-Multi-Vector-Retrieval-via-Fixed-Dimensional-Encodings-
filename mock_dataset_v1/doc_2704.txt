WRITTEN QUESTION E-0654/09 by Sylwester Chruszcz (UEN) to the Commission (9 February 2009) Subject: Ban on Polish meat imports by Kosovo The Kosovo authorities have introduced a ban on imports of cattle and beef products from Poland on the grounds of the alleged threat of BSE. In the light of the facts, this is a strange decision. The incidence of BSE in Poland has been falling from year to year. In 2008 only five cases were recorded and in 2006 only ten (source: www.wetgiv.gov.pl), whereas for example the number of cases in the United Kingdom was 132, in Ireland, 41, in Spain, 67, and so on (source: Animal Diseases Notification System), In addition, all cattle exported from Poland to Kosovo are checked for the presence of BSE. It is therefore certain that no contaminated meat from Poland has ever found its way onto that market. Bans targeting individual Member States seriously restrict competition, affect the Union as a whole and set a dangerous precedent as regards unequal treatment of the countries concerned. Many Polish firms in the meat sector enjoyed a substantial share of the Kosovo market. The loss of trading partners in that country will therefore mean financial losses for these firms, together with a loss of jobs among my constituents. Will the Commission respond swiftly and firmly to persuade the Kosovo authorities to lift the ban on beef imports from Poland?
