WRITTEN QUESTION E-5101/09 by Enikő Győri (PPE) to the Commission (21 October 2009) Subject: Participation of SMEs in public procurement procedures In Western Europe an overwhelming proportion of public procurement contracts are won by national firms (for example the percentage of successful foreign firms in public procurement procedures is 5 % in Sweden, 10 % in Germany and 25 % in Ireland). On the other hand, in Hungary only one third of public procurement contracts are won by Hungarian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and what is more in many cases the foreign multinational which wins the contract entrusts the performance of the contract for a lower price to some national subcontractor, often precisely the one which lost out in the public procurement procedure. Would it be contrary to EC law if the Hungarian government were to put public procurement contracts out to tender on conditions which would enable Hungarian SMEs to participate on a larger scale in projects carried out with state or government funding, alongside job protection measures and EU recommendations for increased support to SMEs?
