Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (6 October 2009) Although the Community rules in force have in the meantime been replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 OJ L 193, 24.7.2009 . of 14 July 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 as regards protected designations of origin and geographical indications, traditional terms, labelling and presentation of certain wines sector products, the Commission sees no reason to change its position since replying to the previous question of the Honourable Member ( P‑2778/07 ) on this subject and will be pursuing the matter with the Spanish authorities in the context of several complaints concerning the initiative of the Spanish Government to establish the indication ‘viñedos de España’ to which the Honourable Member refers. This is because According to Article 67(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2009, the name of a geographical unit and geographical area references may only appear on labels of wines with protected designation of origin, geographical indication or with a geographical indication of a third country. Therefore, the geographical indication referred to above must not be used for wines without a protected designation of origin or geographical indication since it contains the geographical reference ‘España’. Moreover, the use of this geographical name could mislead consumers as it would be similar to what is governed by two other provisions of this regulation: — Article 63(7) of this regulation provides that for wines without a protected designation of origin or geographical indication, Member States may decide to use the terms ‘varietal wines’ supplemented by the name of the Member States concerned; — Article 55 of this regulation allows indications of the provenance for wines without a protected designation of origin or geographical indication.
