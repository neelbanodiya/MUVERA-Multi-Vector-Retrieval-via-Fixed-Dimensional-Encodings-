WRITTEN QUESTION P-5797/08 by Véronique De Keyser (PSE) to the Commission (21 October 2008) Subject: Transparency of the BEPA ‘Dialogue with religions, churches and communities of conviction’ I regularly consult the Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPS)(Dialogue with religions, churches and communities of conviction) website, and I am concerned at the disappearance, which I noticed on 15 October, of the list of ‘partners’. It is true that the list had already undergone certain changes in that until recently it had two main categories and three subcategories in its ‘non-diplomatic representations’ section, and all of those categories had been done away with and replaced with an alphabetical listing. I was told at that time that it was the associations themselves that chose the category in which they wished to be placed, which did tend to invite situations that did not always correspond to the reality. I now note that the list is not present at all on the BEPA website (Dialogue with religions etc.). Could you give me the reason and tell me, if it should prove true that it has indeed been removed, whether this does not run counter to BEPA’s declared, and necessary, transparency?
