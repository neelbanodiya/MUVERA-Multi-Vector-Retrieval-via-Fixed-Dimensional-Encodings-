Question for written answer E-8354/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nick Griffin (NI) (15 October 2010) Subject: Commission staff with Marxist connections Given the extraordinary suffering and loss of life under Marxist/communist regimes during the 20th century, and taking into account the conspiratorial nature of Marxist/communist movements, would the Commission please advise: 1. how many serving Commissioners, including Mr Barroso, have been members of Marxist/communist parties during their lifetime, and for what duration? 2. how many of these persons have expressed regret? 3. whether, given the mass murder, tyranny and suffering that has occurred under communist regimes since 1917 (there is no suggestion of any complicity within this question), these individuals will now express their profound regret for their former affiliations, if they have not already done so, and accept their errors of judgment? 4. whether each of them will condemn, outright, the communist organisations to which they were affiliated and the Marxist theory behind them? 5. whether each of those Commissioners who were Communist Party members in the former Eastern Bloc nations will apologise to the citizens of those nations for the communist regimes’ persecution of their opponents? If not, why not? 6. how many directors-general and heads or deputy heads of each Commissioner's staff have been members of Marxist/communist regimes? 7. whether Mr Barroso will express his regret for his previous Marxist/Maoist affiliations?
