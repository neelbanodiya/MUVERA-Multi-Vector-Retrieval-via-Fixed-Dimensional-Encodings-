Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2010) According to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC, OJ L 79, 19.3.2008. both commercial as well as non-commercial operations of all categories of aircraft, including balloons, are subject to defined essential requirements and are covered by implementing rules adopted by the Commission through ‘regulatory comitology with scrutiny’. This regulation mandates that the implementing rules take duly into account the relevant provisions of the 1944 Chicago Convention creating the International Civil Aviation Organisation. In the field of pilot licensing, those provisions prescribe the curtailment of privileges of pilots who have attained their 60th birthday when engaged in commercial air transport operations. In fact these rules give the possibility to continue until the age of 65 when there is a co-pilot on board who is younger than 60 years. In case of single pilot operations — which is generally the case for balloons- there is not such option. As done in other areas covered by this regulation, the relevant implementing rules in the area of pilot licensing will be adopted by the Commission after the European Aviation Safety Agency has submitted its formal opinion. The Agency is still considering the comments by stakeholders to its proposals and intends to adopt its opinion on pilot licensing by September 2010. The Commission, in the course of the legislative process, will pay due regard to the need to ensure the proportionality of the new implementing rules, in particular in relation to small and medium‑sized enterprises and general aviation along the lines of its communication of 11 January 2008, ‘An Agenda for Sustainable Future in General and Business Aviation’ COM(2007)869 final. .
