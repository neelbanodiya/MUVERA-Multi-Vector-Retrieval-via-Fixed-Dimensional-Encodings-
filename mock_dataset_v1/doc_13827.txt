Sakharov Prize for 2010 has been awarded to Cuban political dissident Guillermo Fariñas, who will probably not be allowed to pick up the prize. Background On 26 October, the Foreign Affairs Council mandated High Representative Catherine Ashton to explore the possibilities on the way forward for relations with Cuba, and to report back to the Council as soon as possible "within the framework of EU's common position." She is expected to report back in December. 20101108IPR92652 Sakharov Prize Website of Subcommittee on Human Rights EN 1 LINK /parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=42 EN 2 LINK /activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=DROI -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
