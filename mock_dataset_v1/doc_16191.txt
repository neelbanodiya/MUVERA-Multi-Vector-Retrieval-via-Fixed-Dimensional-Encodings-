2004/C 78 E/106 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2349/03 by Camilo Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (16 July 2003) Subject: Galicia and CAP reform What will be the situation of Galician agriculture when the CAP reform approved by the Council is implemented, bearing in mind that the Galician farming industry is characterised by the predominance of milk production, land-based family farms and a clear vocation and capacity for modernisation and, on the other hand, that the milk quota is totally inadequate to allow aspirations of non-Malthusian development? How will the measures taken as regards rural development affect Galician society? The Galician Government has stated that, in order to offset the fall in milk prices, Galicia will receive a sum of EUR 530 million in direct aid for the milk sector between now and 2014: what will be the significance of these funds, and where will they come from?
