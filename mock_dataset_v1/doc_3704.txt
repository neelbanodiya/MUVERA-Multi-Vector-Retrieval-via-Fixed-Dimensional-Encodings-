Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (23 January 2006) The Commission has addressed to the Greek Government the question of whether Greek national legislation on the pension scheme for civil servants and members of the armed forces in Greece could be in breach of Article 141 of the EC Treaty in as far as they provided for different pensionable age and different requirements of length of service for men and women. The problem addressed by the Commission does not arise out of the Greek transposition of Directive 96/97/EC Council Directive 96/97/EC of 20 December 1996 amending Directive 86/378/EEC on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in occupational social security schemes. but instead arises out of the code of civil and military pensions. The Commission has just received the reply from the Greek Government and is in the course of analysing it. The case will be pursued according to the rules under Article 226 of the EC Treaty. Decree No 87 of 4 April 2002 (Greek Government Gazette No 66, 4 April 2002) has been adopted in order to transpose Directive 96/97/EC. Therefore, Greece has formally complied with the Court's judgment in C-457/89 Commission v. Greece . However, this legislation is not the subject of the case. The decisive question in the case is whether the abovementioned pension scheme falls under Article 141 of the EC Treaty.
