Question for written answer E-008435/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (22 September 2011) Subject: Fourfold increase in late payments by public administrations in Spain In Spain, an excessively high proportion of payments for commercial transactions between companies, or between companies and public authorities, are made much later than the agreed date. These delays entail high costs for the businesses involved, create social tensions and are extremely counterproductive in terms of the competitiveness of private companies in the Member States. Directive 2000/35/EC was approved as a means of tackling this problem. The directive does not harmonise payment periods, but creates a legal right to charge interest 30 days after the date of the invoice, applicable in all EU Member States. Spain incorporated the directive into national legislation through Law 3/2004 of 29 December 2004. In June 2010 the Spanish Parliament approved a reform of Law 3/2004 combating late payments, establishing that firms have a maximum period of 60 days in which to pay their suppliers, with the period being limited to 30 days in the case of public administrations. The text set out a transitional period which will last until 2013. During that time, public authorities were to reduce payment periods to a maximum of 50 days in 2010 and 2011, 45 days by 2012 and, finally, 30 days by 2013. However, on 14 August 2011, Spanish daily newspaper El País headlined the day's edition saying that ‘Spain's authorities now owe EUR 50 billion in unpaid bills, four times higher than before the crisis’. Further information was given in another article http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Gobiernos/suman/50000/millones/impagos/cuadruple/crisis/elpepiesp/20110814elpepinac_1/Tes?print= in the same edition, including data showing that local authorities, regional authorities and the central government pay their suppliers on average 238, 155 and 140 days respectively after receipt of the invoice. Given that the situation is not improving and that authorities in Spain have repeatedly failed to comply with the relevant EU and Spanish regulations: 1. Is the Commission planning to open infringement proceedings against the Spanish Government in accordance with Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union? 2. Does the Commission agree that these delays in settling accounts by the Spanish public authorities, together with a lack of credit, are among the main problems facing Spain's small and medium-sized enterprises and the country's economic recovery?
