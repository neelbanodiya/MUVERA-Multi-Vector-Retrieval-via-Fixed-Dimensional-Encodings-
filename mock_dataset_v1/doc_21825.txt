children may attend the Schools within the limits set by the Board of Governors’. A progressive increase in the level of fees (proposed by the Commission in light of Parliament’s Bösch report ‘Report of the Committee on Budgets: On the future financing of the European Schools’ (2002/2083(INI)), A5-0395/2002 final,13 November 2002. ) for the children of non-EU staff in order to close the present wide gap between fees and the real cost of education would not, in the opinion of the Commission, jeopardise the existence of the European school system, whose primary objective is and remains the education of the children of EU staff. 3. The Commission refers the Honourable Member to the answer given above in relation to question 1. In addition, the Commission would like to point out that pupils of the European Schools have always received teaching in their mother tongue if it is an official EU language, and that language sections are set up whenever it is justified under the established criteria. These principles have been respected in relation to successive enlargements, including the most recent one. 4. In its consultation document, which has been transmitted to Parliament, the Commission puts forward its proposals to all stakeholders of the European School system to ensure that its continuing success in providing a unique form of multicultural, multilingual education is neither diminished nor jeopardised. In the light of the developments in education over the half century of the Schools’ operation, together with major and ongoing changes in the size and nature of the European Union, the consultation seeks to establish a common basis for further strengthening the system so that it is able to meet the challenges of the future and operate successfully in an increasingly diverse environment.
