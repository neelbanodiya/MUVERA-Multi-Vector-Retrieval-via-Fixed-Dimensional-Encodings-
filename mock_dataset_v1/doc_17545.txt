5, but criticised the method used by the Council. There seems to be a relatively significant divergence between the two arms of the budgetary authority as to what the adequate margin should be and to how far the budgetary rigour can be applied without jeopardising the functioning of the institutions. The agreement on heading 5 is not likely to be reached by Parliament's first reading, as criteria for the evaluation of the specific needs of the institutions seem to be divergent. The Rapporteurs have been studying all the options available and would like to hear the comments of the Members of the Committee on Budgets on the strategy to be chosen. The Rapporteurs consider that an adequate margin should be left under the ceiling of Heading 5, as agreed in the Interinstitutional agreement on budgetary discipline. The institutions should be provided with sufficient means to ensure their proper functioning, while respecting budgetary rigour. At this stage, it is not yet possible to propose more exact figures as the requests by the institutions are being evaluated. More detailed proposals for each institution will follow, and the Rapporteurs will seek to keep these in line with the guidelines already adopted and the overall strategy Parliament will decide to choose.
