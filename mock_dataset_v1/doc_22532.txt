Second, some Member States currently have requirements for a formal notification or registration of the use of credit claims as collateral. The current Council compromise does allow their maintenance. However, the experience from Member States where credit claims are already widely used as collateral does not suggest such requirements are necessary for any practical purpose. The rapporteur is of the opinion that formal notification requirement should be phased out and therefore introduces a sunset clause in five years from the entry into force of the Directive to the right for the member states to require notification or registration.

This Directive does not preclude Member States from requiring that a credit claim be
