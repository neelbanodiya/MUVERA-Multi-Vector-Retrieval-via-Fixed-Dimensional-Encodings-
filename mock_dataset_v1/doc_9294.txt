{ "context": [ [ "Okhotsk Plate", [ "The Okhotsk Plate is a minor tectonic plate covering the Sea of Okhotsk, the Kamchatka Peninsula, Sakhalin Island and Tōhoku and Hokkaidō in Japan.", " It was formerly considered a part of the North American Plate, but recent studies indicate that it is an independent plate, bounded on the north by the North American Plate.", " The boundary is a left-lateral moving transform fault, the Ulakhan Fault.", " On the east, the plate is bounded by the Pacific Plate at the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench and the Japan Trench, on the south by the Philippine Sea Plate at the Nankai Trough, on the west by the Eurasian Plate, and possibly on the southwest by the Amurian Plate." ] ], [ "Sorong Fault", [ "Sorong fault also (Sorong Fault Zone, SFZ) is an active, broad zone of inferred left lateral shear at the triple junction of the Australian plate, Eurasian plate, and Pacific plates, where many plate fragments exist, such as the Philippine Sea Plate, Bird's Head Plate, Halmahera Plate and the Molucca Sea Plate.", " It has been implicated in numerous large earthquakes.", " It is one of the two major faults created by the Australian and Pacific plate convergence, the other being the Ramu-Markham Fault zone." ] ], [ "Jan Mayen Microcontinent", [ "The Jan Mayen Microcontinent is a fragment of continental crust within the oceanic part of the western Eurasian Plate lying northeast of Iceland.", " At the onset of separation between the Greenland and Eurasian plates 55 million years ago, it formed part of the eastern margin of the Greenland Plate.", " Propagation of a new spreading center from the Reykjanes Ridge separated this microcontinent from the Greenland Plate.", " For a short period it formed a microplate, until the Aegir Ridge became inactive, after which it formed part of the Eurasian Plate.", " The island of Jan Mayen is a much younger feature, formed of volcanic rock, built up at the northernmost tip of the microcontinent." ] ], [ "Carrauntoohil", [ "Carrauntoohil ( ,Irish: Corrán Tuathail ) is the highest peak on the island of Ireland.", " Located in County Kerry, it is 1038 m high and is the central peak of the Macgillycuddy's Reeks range.", " The ridge northward leads to Ireland's second-highest peak, Beenkeragh (1,010 m), while the ridge westward leads to the third-highest peak, Caher (1,001 m).", "
