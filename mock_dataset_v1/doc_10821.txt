Question for written answer E-001860/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Lorenzo Fontana (EFD) (3 March 2011) Subject: Steadily worsening situation of Christians in the state of Orissa On 18 January of this year Mr Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, chair of the National Human Rights Commission, went to the Indian state of Orissa to urge the local authorities to make greater efforts to protect and uphold the rights of the Christian minority there. In one case, violence committed by Hindu extremists resulted in the arrest of two young Christians from whom a (Hindu) thief had stolen a gold chain. According to statements made by a Catholic leader, Pradiman Digal, the police are also implicated in confrontations with citizens belonging to religious minorities. In view of these developments, does the Commission intend to step up the dialogue with the authorities in Orissa to uphold the freedom of religion? Does the Commission intend to use the development aid provided by the European Union as a means of bringing more pressure to bear on the process of improving respect for, and protecting, religious freedom?
