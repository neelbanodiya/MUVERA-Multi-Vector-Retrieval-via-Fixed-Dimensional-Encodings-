Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (5 November 2009) The European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Export was replaced by the Council Common Position Defining Common Rules Governing the Control of Exports of Military Technology and Equipment (2008/944/CFSP) with effect from 8 December 2008. The main responsibility and related concrete steps to implement controls of exports in accordance with the Common Position fall under the second pillar governed exclusively by Member States.
