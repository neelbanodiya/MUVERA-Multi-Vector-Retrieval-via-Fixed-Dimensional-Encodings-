for the triggering of the mechanism foreseen under Directive 2001/55/EC are not met. The large majority of persons who have so far reached the EU from the Southern Mediterranean countries are not displaced persons unable to return to their country of origin but economic migrants of Tunisian nationality. Moreover, temporary protection can be triggered in particular if there is also a risk that the asylum system will be unable to process the influx without adverse effects for its efficient operation. There appears, for the time being, to be no such risk as the number of asylum requests received has so far been relatively limited. The continuous flow of persons who may be in need of international protection, in particular coming from Libya, may in the future reach a point where the conditions for triggering the directive will be met. The Commission will therefore continue to closely monitor the situation, including with the support of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and will take the necessary steps when appropriate.
