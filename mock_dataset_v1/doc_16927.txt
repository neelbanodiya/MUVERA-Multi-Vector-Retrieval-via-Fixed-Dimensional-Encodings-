Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (21 April 2008) The Commission is aware of the emergence of a new strain of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcous aureus (MRSA) for which pigs might be a potential reservoir for infection of humans by direct contact or through consumption of food. The risk factors, for example the potential influence of production conditions and the public health risk of this strain are, however, not very clear yet. The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member about the emergence of MRSA in pigs and the increasing resistance of zoonotic bacteria to antibiotics. Therefore, a number of initiatives have been launched. Firstly, Commission Decision 2008/55/EC Commission Decision 2008/55/EC of 20 December 2007 concerning a financial contribution from the Community towards a survey on the prevalence of Salmonella spp. and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in herds of breeding pigs to be carried out in the Member States (notified under Document Number C(2007) 6579), OJ L 14, 17.1.2008. obliges Member States to carry out a baseline survey in 2008 to assess the prevalence of MRSA in breeding pigs across the Community. The survey will allow the evaluation of the spread of MRSA among pigs in all Member States. On sampled holdings, information on production conditions is also collected. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been requested to analyse the data as soon as they are available. The EFSA will also assess the public health risk and potential risk factors based on the analysis of the survey and other research data available. Secondly, monitoring of antimicrobial resistance of certain zoonotic bacteria is mandatory in pigs and pork in accordance with the provisions in Directive 2003/99/EC Directive 2003/99/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the monitoring of zoonoses and zoonotic agents, amending Council Decision 90/424/EEC and repealing Council Directive 92/117/EEC, OJ L 325, 12.12.2003. . This monitoring has been further harmonised in 2007 by the adoption of Decision 2007/407/EC Commission Decision 2007/407/EC of 12 June 2007 on a harmonised monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella in poultry and pigs (notified under document number C(2007) 2421), OJ L 153, 14.6.2007. to closely follow up and compare the presence of resistant Salmonella isolates in the Member States. The results will be forwarded to the EFSA before the end of May 2008 and analysed. Finally, the EFSA is preparing a scientific opinion on food-borne antimicrobial resistance
