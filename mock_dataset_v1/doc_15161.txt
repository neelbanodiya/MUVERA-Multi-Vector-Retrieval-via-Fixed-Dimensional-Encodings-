Question for written answer E-4395/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nigel Farage (EFD) (16 June 2010) Subject: Dearth of appointments of people from the new Member States to director-general posts at the Commission When Neil Kinnock was a Commissioner, the EU’s General Affairs Council and the Commission decided that the principles of geographical balance and equality between Member States should be adhered to when appointing staff to posts at every level in the Commission. More than six years have now passed since ten new Member States joined the EU, and it has been more than three years since another two Member States joined. It would seem, however, that the current College of Commissioners has forgotten all about the two principles mentioned above, particularly where appointments to top management posts are concerned. In fact today we are faced with an incomprehensible situation in which there is not a single director-general at the Commission from one of the new Member States. Just months after their countries had joined what was at the time the EEC, people from Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Sweden and especially Spain had already been appointed to director-general posts. Can the Commission explain why it is being so slow — or even so overtly reticent — about appointing people from the new Member States to top management posts in the current Commission? Looking at the current situation with regard to appointments, it would seem that instead of applying the institutional principles mentioned above, the Commission is seeking — at all costs — to shore up the networks of influence and personal interest that are currently in place. With this in mind it is also worth remembering that, in its report on fraud and administrative problems at the Santer Commission, a committee of independent experts — the ‘committee of wise men’ who looked into the matter and made recommendations — pointed out that personal nepotism was one of the main internal factors giving rise to fraud and inefficiencies within the Commission.
