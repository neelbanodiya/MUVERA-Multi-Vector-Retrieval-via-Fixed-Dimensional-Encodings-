making a total of €84 m; - €55m of humanitarian aid for the Horn of Africa to be found from the 2002 budget; €47.5m for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), which will also cover funding for the EU police force in Bosnia Herzegovina. Funds earmarked for updating North Korea’s nuclear energy programme have been frozen until there are satisfactory guarantees over nuclear non-profileration. The CFSP Council has now undertaken to provide Parliament each year before 15 June with a document setting out its foreign policy priorities. As regards CFSP Joint Actions, Council will send Parliament detailed information about the budgetary implications of any such action within 5 working days. Lastly, as part of the regular political dialogue between the Institutions, the Council Presidency will draw attention to the President of Parliament and the chairs of the committees responsible (Foreign Affairs and Budgets) of any CFSP Joint Actions that might have important financial implications. Administrative expenditure and enlargement Here the committee is proposing slight increases on Council’s figure of €5.316bn but has agreed with Council to retain some €30m below the ceiling to cover any contingencies. The cost of extra administrative staff required by the Commission in the preparations for enlargement is to come from funds not spent in 2002 (frontloading). Enlargement While accepting Council’s commitments figure for funds earmarked for the preparation for enlargement, the Budgets Committee is proposing an extra €150m to the payments figure of €2.557bn. While the committee recognises problems with regard to ensuring funds are spent, it does not want to see the new Member States becoming net contributors. The committee also wants Parliament’s decision-making body, the Conference of Presidents, to look carefully at the financial impact of its decisions.
