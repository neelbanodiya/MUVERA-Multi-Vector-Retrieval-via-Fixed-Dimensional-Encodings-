Answer given by Mrs Diamantopoulou on behalf of the Commission (6 January 2004) The European Union already has substantial legislation on gender equality in employment. Council Directive 76/207/EEC of 9 February 1976 on the implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions OJ L 39, 14.2.1976 . guarantees equal treatment for men and women in sport, provided they are professional sportspeople and fall within the definition of a worker . In addition, on 5 November 2003 the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Directive COM(2003) 657 final. implementing the principle of equal treatment for women and men outside the labour market. The aim of this Directive is the progressive implementation of equal treatment. With regard to women's competitions at the Olympic Games, the Commission is unable to comment on a matter which is not within its jurisdiction. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which organises the competition, is a private body whose job it is to organise the event not only according to sporting criteria but also in line with commercial criteria. The rules for participation in the Games are decided jointly by the International Olympic Committee and international sports federations.
