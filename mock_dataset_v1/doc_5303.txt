ORAL QUESTION H-0149/03 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by John Purvis to the Commission Subject: Identification and registration of sheep and goats The European Commission has adopted a proposal for a regulation on the identification and registration of sheep and goats. What are the likely costs to farmers to introduce such a manual scheme and what cost-benefit analysis has been carried out? In a country like Scotland, where large volumes of sheep are routinely processed on farms and in auction markets, a manual scheme will be impractical and impossibly expensive to implement. Why is the Commission in favour of implementing the manual scheme this year rather than waiting until a reliable electronic ID system is available?
