WRITTEN QUESTION E-2649/07 by Frank Vanhecke (ITS) to the Commission (23 May 2007) Subject: Population growth in Europe On presenting to the European Union its second report on the evolution of the family in Europe, the Institute for Family Policy (IFP) pointed to a sharp deceleration in European population growth rates, indicating that the future was extremely uncertain, given the prospect of negative population growth in Europe from 2025. The annual birth rate in Europe has fallen from 6 million in the 1980s to 5.1 million in 2006 (IPF, Report on the evolution of the family in Europe 2006). The IFP accordingly advocates the adoption of demographic policies and measures specifically designed to achieve a prompt reversal of this trend. What measures and initiatives has the Commission already undertaken to encourage Member States to adopt specific demographic policies to this end? What relevant initiatives and measures will the Commission take in future?
