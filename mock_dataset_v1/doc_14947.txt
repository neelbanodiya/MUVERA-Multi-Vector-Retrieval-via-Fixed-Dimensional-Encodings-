Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2011) 1.-3. The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑3837/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB . In addition, Member States are entitled to carry out police checks, including in the internal border zones, to verify whether a person stays legally on their territory. If during such checks it appears that the person, holder of a residence permit issued by another Member State, does not fulfil the conditions of stay in the Member State concerned, the Member State which issued the residence permit has to take the person back under Article 6(2) of the Return Directive. 4. The Commission is of the opinion that the current Union legal framework, on which agreement has been found by the European legislator end 2008, is appropriate since it gives to the Member States an autonomous right to decide on the status of third-country nationals illegally present on their territory while clearly defining the conditions for the free movement of these persons within the Schengen area.
