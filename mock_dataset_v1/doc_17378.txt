Treaty confirm the validity of the positions it has taken. 1.2 For example, the referendum results in France and the Netherlands not only demonstrate the failure of the Member States and the European institutions to communicate to the public what Europe is actually about and how it reaches agreements but, they also reveal the gulf separating the public from the European project. It must be said that this gulf is not unique to those countries and is not simply the result of poor communication or the current economic situation, but it does call into question the nature of the agreement itself and thus the way in which it was reached. 1.3 It is worthwhile recalling the "clear messages" which, in the Committee's October 2004 opinion, it believed should be got across to civil society: • the use of the instrument of the "Convention", a "step forward in the process of democratising the European venture"; • the establishment of a Constitution as a "revolutionary" step in the history of the European venture; • the establishment of a more democratic Union which would recognise that the interests of the people are paramount in the building of Europe; • the establishment of a Union which would afford better protection of the fundamental rights of European citizens; • the establishment of a Union which would be capable of meeting the aspirations of its citizens by virtue of the Community method and Community policies. 1.4 Despite a series of shortcomings in the Constitutional Treaty which the Committee also highlighted, it argued strongly for European civil society to be rallied behind the achievements of the Constitutional Treaty in order to overcome these shortcomings. 1.5 Those identified by the Committee included the following: • the lack of adequate operational provisions for implementing the principle of participatory democracy; • the absence of provisions acknowledging the role played by organised civil society in implementing the subsidiarity principle; • the weakness of EU governance as regards economic and employment policy and the absence of rules providing for consultation of the European Parliament and the EESC in these areas, which concern civil society players most of all. 1.6 In the Committee's opinion, all of these observations remain pertinent and valid. In its October 2004 opinion, the Committee argued strongly not only in favour of the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, but also that EU citizens needed to be made aware of
