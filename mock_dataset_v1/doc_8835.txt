Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (19 December 2011) The Commission agrees with the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) that there is no hierarchy between social rights and the other rights protected under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. As a number of other rights, social rights may only be subject to limitations which are necessary to meet general interest objectives. The Commission is committed to ensure that all the rights provided for in the Charter, including social rights, are effectively implemented. In order to track progress on the implementation of the Charter in the areas within EU competence, the Commission publishes annually a Report on the Application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which contains examples of how the provisions of the Charter, including social rights, are applied by EU institutions and bodies, as well as by the Member States when they are implementing EC law The first annual report was published in March 2011: 2010 Report on the Application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, available at: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/rights/docs/report_EU_charter_FR_2010_en.pdf . In addition, the Commission has announced in the Single Market Act it will propose initiatives aimed at clarifying the exercise of freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services alongside fundamental social rights COM(2011) 206 of 13.4.2011. .
