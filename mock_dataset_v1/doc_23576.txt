Question for written answer E-008863/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marek Henryk Migalski (ECR) (6 October 2011) Subject: Sentencing of a Polish activist in Belarus On 20 September 2011, a court in Grodno upheld a suspended sentence of three years’ imprisonment for the head of the Supervisory Board of the Union of Poles in Belarus, Andrzej Poczobut, thereby rejecting the Polish activist’s appeal against his conviction in July for defaming the Belarusian President, Alexander Lukashenko. This ruling means that in two years’ time Andrzej Poczobut will once again have to face the court, which will assess his actions during the period of the suspended sentence. It is quite clear that the sentencing of Andrzej Poczobut was politically motivated. Poczobut was denied the right to effective defence because the court rejected all his applications, including an application for defence witnesses to be heard. Neither journalists nor activists from the Union of Poles in Belarus were permitted to attend the hearing. Does the Commission intend to intervene on behalf of Andrzej Poczobut, who is clearly the victim of a campaign of repression by the Belarusian authorities?
