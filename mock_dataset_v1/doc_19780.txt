WRITTEN QUESTION P-6545/07 by Søren Bo Søndergaard (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (9 January 2008) Subject: Diplomatic protection In the Draft Treaty on a Constitution for Europe of 29 October 2004, the question of diplomatic and consular protection is regulated by Article III‑127, with reference to Article I‑10(2)(c). In the Lisbon Treaty, it is regulated by Article 20. In the light of the Commission's Green Paper on diplomatic and consular protection of Union citizens in third countries (COM(2006)712), will the Commission say what the implications of the amended wording of Article 20 of the Lisbon Treaty are in regard to further cooperation in this area? In particular, does the Commission consider the effect of the amended wording to be that Article 20 cannot be used as a legal basis for adopting decisions which regulate/harmonise matters relating to the exercise by Union citizens of the right to diplomatic and consular protection?
