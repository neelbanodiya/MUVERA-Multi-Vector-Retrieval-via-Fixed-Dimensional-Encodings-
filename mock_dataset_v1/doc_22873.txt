ORAL QUESTION H-0089/10 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Papanikolaou to the Commission Subject: Evaluation of the Culture Programme 2007-2013 As part of efforts to promote and highlight European culture, in 2007 the European Union adopted the Culture Programme which will run until 2013. It has a total budget of approximately 400 million euros. The objectives of this programme include raising awareness of those aspects of culture which are of European significance and promoting the transnational mobility of people working in the cultural sector. How does the Commission evaluate progress so far in attaining these two objectives? Are Member States showing an interest and taking part in Culture Programme, or does the Commission consider that it should launch new and more dynamic initiatives to attain its objectives by 2013?
