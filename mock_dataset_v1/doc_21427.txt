accurate information; 5. Encourages the Commission strongly to intervene, together with the Member States, to defend consumers' legitimate rights and expectations whenever there is evidence of counterfeiting and/or use of fraudulent or misleading origin marking by non-EU producers and importers; 6. Considers the proposal for a Council regulation introducing compulsory indications of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries into the European Union ('origin marking') an essential basis to reach the objective of transparency and appropriate information for the consumer as well as consistency in international trade rules; 7. Considers that, from 1 December 2009, under the ordinary legislative procedure set up in the Lisbon Treaty, consultation and exchange of views between the European Parliament and the Council should formally start and that any further delay would seriously damage citizens' rights, social actors and free market; 8. Calls on the Commission to maintain its proposal unchanged and resubmit it to Parliament under Article 207 of the Lisbon Treaty, immediately after that treaty enters into force, taking into consideration also the possibility of introducing the regulation as a pilot project; 9. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
