that a legal uncertainty exists in practice which often inhibits planned investments; calls therefore on the Commission to examine to what extent the subsidy rules can be simplified and rendered more attractive to investors, and how better coordination can be achieved between European and national programmes; 7. Reaffirms the principle of network neutrality and takes the view that open, equal access to telecommunications infrastructure and information technology is vital to ensure social, economic and cultural progress; 8. Stresses that high-quality content must constitute a priority for the emerging broadband networks and must help to promote access to, and the sharing and dissemination of, cultural goods and services, open up spaces for creativity and expression, and foster exchanges between creative people; 9. Notes that broadcasters should be able to offer a high standard of pluralist audiovisual content, using existing broadcasting platforms, including terrestrial platforms, as well as broadband networks, in particular for on-demand services, provided that the broadband networks fulfil the same requirements in terms of quality of service and seek to maximise their spectrum efficiency and coverage; 10. S tresses, with reference to the interrelationship between the establishment and further development of mobile broadband networks and frequency policies, that European frequency policies must indubitably take the economic, social and cultural values of radio frequencies into consideration ; 11. Emphasises strongly the necessity of efficient use of the available frequencies and calls for technological neutrality; 12. Emphasises therefore that the use of radio frequencies by already existing users, such as radio and PMSE, which are of great importance for the creation and promulgation of cultural provisions as well as linguistic and cultural diversity and support for the spread of opinions and media pluralism, must not be interrupted through the establishment and further development of mobile broadband networks, and must be left scope for further development; 13. Notes that, in order to offer a high standard of pluralist audiovisual content at an affordable price to the consumer, broadcasters must be able to choose between the different broadcasting platforms by taking account of technical and cost efficiency: broadband for on-demand services, and terrestrial television for the transmission of linear content to large audiences; 14. Recommends that Member States favour a policy making for equal access to content, the priority being to connect public establishments, especially schools, libraries and universities, to broadband networks so as to encourage knowledge-sharing, as well as the promotion of
