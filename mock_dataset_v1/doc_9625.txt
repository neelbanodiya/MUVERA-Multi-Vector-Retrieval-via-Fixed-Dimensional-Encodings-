Question for written answer E-000351/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 David Martin (S&D) (1 February 2011) Subject: Price fixing on e-books Is the Commission aware of the recent announcement by Amazon that Hachette Publishing Group in the United Kingdom is requiring retailers to support an agency model of publisher-fixed prices on e-books? In 1997, a court ruling declared it illegal for publishers to fix the prices of paperback and hardback books. Does the Commission consider the price fixing of e-books to be a similar breach of EU competition law? Is the Commission investigating this issue?
