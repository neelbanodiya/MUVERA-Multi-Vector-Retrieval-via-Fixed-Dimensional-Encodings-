on Unfair Commercial Practices, to which the Honourable Member refers to in his question, does not regulate the sounds or volume thresholds in television advertising. The directive fully harmonises the legislation of the Member States in the field of misleading advertising and other unfair commercial practices in the context of business-to-consumers relationships but it does not provide for any safeguards relating to health, safety, taste and decency or other non-economic interests of consumers.
