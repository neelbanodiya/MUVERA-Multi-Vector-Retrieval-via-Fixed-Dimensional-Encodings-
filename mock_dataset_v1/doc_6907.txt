Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (18 September 2008) The Commission is aware of the approval by the House of Commons of a counter-terrorism Bill proposed by the United Kingdom Government, which includes provisions to extend the time limit on detention without charge for persons suspected of terrorist offences from 28 days to 42 days. The Commission follows such matters closely. However, the Commission does not comment on draft legislation still undergoing parliamentary deliberation, as is the case for this Bill which has not yet been approved by the House of Lords.
