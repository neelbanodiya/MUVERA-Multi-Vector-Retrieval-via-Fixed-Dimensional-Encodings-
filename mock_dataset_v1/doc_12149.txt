to include a debate on the Stability Pact (with Commission and Council present). However, if accepted, there will be no resolution Social and Employment Policy Green light for European health insurance card Anne Elisabet JENSEN (ELDR, DK) Report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community, and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 fixing the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, in respect of the alignment of rights and the simplification of procedures ( COM(2003) 378 – C5-0290/2003 – 2003/0138(COD)) Doc.: A5-0399/2003 Procedure : Codecision (1st reading) Debate : 04.12.2003 Parliament's Employment and Social Affairs Committee is keen to see a European health insurance card introduced in June 2004, as planned by the European Commission. For this reason, MEPs in the committee are proposing only a few amendments to the Commission's draft regulation which seeks to pave the way for the introduction of such a card by amending existing legislation. In a draft legislative resolution by Anne Elisabet JENSEN (ELDR, DK) MEPs in the committee are merely calling for the Member States to ensure that the individuals concerned are informed of their rights and obligations. At present an EU citizen who needs medical treatment during a temporary visit to another Member State needs various pieces of paper (E111, E128, E110 and E119). The new standard personalised card will sweep away all these forms that people now have to obtain from their health insurance authorities. It will be introduced in several stages: as of June 2004 it will replace form E111, which is required for short stays such as holidays, and then other forms needed by students or job seekers. An electronic card that can be read by computer is also planned by 2008. However, before the card can be introduced, the existing regulations on the application of social security schemes (EEC/1408/71 and EEC/574/72) need to be amended. The Commission proposal being backed by the committee would bring the rights of all insured persons covered by the regulations into line and simplify the formalities for insured persons who need care in a state where they are staying temporarily. Once these conditions are met, the card can come into being and one more barrier to free movement within Europe will have been lifted. Constitutional Affairs European
