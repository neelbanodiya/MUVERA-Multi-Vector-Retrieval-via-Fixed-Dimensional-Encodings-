Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (26 February 2007) Following the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑494/04 OJ C 84, 3.4.2004 . and the subsequent thorough investigation of the facts of the case, the Commission issued a Letter of Formal Notice in April 2006 Infringement procedure 2004/2080. , concerning the M‑30 ring-road project in Madrid, since certain provisions of Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 concerning the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 . as modified by Council Directive 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 . of 3 March 1997 had not been properly complied with in relation to this project. The answer of the Spanish authorities of July 2006 to the letter of formal notice issued by the Commission explained that they were ready to follow Commission guidance to put an end to the infringement. Some letters were exchanged towards the end of 2006 between the Commission and the Spanish authorities in order to identify what needed to be done to repair the possible extent of the infringement incurred by the Spanish authorities with regard to the abovementioned directives. In conclusion, the Spanish authorities agreed to take measures to repair the infringement and presented the Commission with a timetable for the implementation of such measures and promised to provide regular information on progress made in the implementation of the measures. This proposal has been examined and considered positively by the Commission. The Commission will follow closely the implementation of these measures and, for the time being, the infringement case will remain open.
