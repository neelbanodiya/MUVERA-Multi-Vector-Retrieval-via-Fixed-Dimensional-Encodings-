Answer given by Mr Prodi on behalf of the Commission (23 May 2002) No circular has been issued at the Commission which forbids its officials to use their mother tongue or obliges them to use only English or French. The Commission would first of all stress that under Article 28(f) of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, one of the general conditions of recruitment is that applicants have a thorough knowledge of one of the languages of the Communities and a satisfactory knowledge of another language of the Communities to the extent necessary for the performance of their duties . It is therefore not stipulated that knowledge of a particular Community language takes precedence over knowledge of other languages. The Commission would furthermore point out that according to the implementing provisions in its Rules of Procedure, it uses three languages in practice, namely German, French and English. The Commission therefore does not see any objective reason for compelling its officials to use a particular language — even if this is their mother tongue — and depart from the existing rules and established practice. As regards the specific case of the Commission's participation in parliamentary committee meetings where interpretation into all the EU's official languages is available, the Commission's officials are free to choose the language they wish to speak. Thus, for example, some choose — for convenience — to express themselves in the language in which they have been dealing with a particular question, whilst others — because of the technical nature of the discussions — use a language familiar to the largest number of participants so that most of them can follow the proceedings directly.
