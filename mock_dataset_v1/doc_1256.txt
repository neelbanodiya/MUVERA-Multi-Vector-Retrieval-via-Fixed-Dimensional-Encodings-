based on the partnership of the two communities in Northern Ireland. This has proved to be an effective way of diluting some of the tensions between the communities and across the border, of bringing people together to work on concrete issues, and of giving a wider European dimension to their activities. It is the Commission's intention to continue its ongoing contribution to the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland. As part of this commitment, following discussions with First Minister Ian Paisley and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness on 2 May 2007, the President of the Commission announced that a task force would be set up in the Commission to help Northern Ireland to benefit fully from European policies and programmes in creating growth, innovation and new opportunities for its citizens. The Member of the Commission responsible for Regional policy, who will chair this task force, had a first meeting with members of the Executive in Belfast on 8 June 2007.
