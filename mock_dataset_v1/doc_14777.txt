Question for written answer P-001741/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ashley Fox (ECR) (23 February 2011) Subject: Cornish Stingers Stinging-nettle beer, such as ‘Cornish Stingers’, has been a traditional drink in many parts of the United Kingdom for centuries. Traditional small family brewers are now facing closure as a result of the financial implications of the EU’s regulations. As nettle beer does not contain malt it has been ruled a ‘made-wine’ in the same category as alcopops and as such is subject to increased backdated taxes. 1. Does the Commissioner not agree that small-scale brewers of traditional beers should be protected under EU regulations rather than harmed? 2. Can the Commission confirm whether, in order to be classified as beer, an alcoholic drink must contain malt? 3. Would the Commission consider allowing a derogation to protect traditional beers such as ‘Cornish Stingers’ from facing closure and ruin, with all of the historical, cultural and economic problems that this would cause?
