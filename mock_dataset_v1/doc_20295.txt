Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (7 December 2011) The project mentioned by the Honourable Member falls within the priority areas of action of the Environment Policy and Governance strand of the LIFE+ programme. This strand aims at co-funding demonstration and/or innovation projects related to any of the ‘priority areas of action’ set out in the guidelines for applicants. There is neither fixed minimum nor maximum size for project budgets. Historically, the average grant awarded has been in excess of EUR 1 million. The maximum European Union co-financing rate for LIFE+ Environment Policy and Governance projects is 50 % of the total eligible costs. On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund programme for the Centro region in Portugal, for 2007-2013, namely within its priority I (Competitiveness, innovation and knowledge) might finance some of the described activities, according to the national eligibility rules and subject to the successful fulfilment of applicable selection criteria. As the Honourable Member is aware, the shared management principle applies to the implementation of the Structural Funds. In this context, the selection of projects is the responsibility of the competent national authorities managing the programmes. The Commission would therefore suggest the Honourable Member contacts directly the managing authority and consults the Internet site of the ‘Centro’ ERDF programme: MAIS CENTRO — Programa Operacional Regional do Centro Rua Bernardim Ribeiro, 80 3000-069 Coimbra Tel.: +351 239 863 505 Fax: +351 239 863 510 E-mail: maiscentro@ccdrc.pt Website: http://www.maiscentro.qren.pt/
