Question for oral answer O-000022/2012 to the Commission Rule 115 Simon Busuttil , Manfred Weber , Jean-Paul Gauzès on behalf of the PPE Group Subject: Extra-territorial impact of third-country legislation and EU data protection laws Third-country legislation may have an extra-territorial impact directly affecting companies and citizens within the EU. Such legislation may clash with EU legislation, for example in the field of data protection where the Medicare Act, FATCA, FISA and the Patriot Act require the submission of personal data stored in Europe to the US authorities. 1. Does the Commission consider that third-country legislation, such as these examples of US legislation, can effectively overrule relevant EU data protection legislation and the rights and guarantees it provides for citizens and businesses? Is the Commission aware of any other examples of third-country legislation with extra-territorial impact that conflicts with relevant EU data protection legislation and related rights? 2. Does the Commission consider that the transfer of personal data to third countries, as required in the above-mentioned examples of US legislation, constitutes a violation of relevant EU data protection legislation? 3. What immediate action will the Commission take to address these issues with the relevant US authorities, and what will the Commission do to protect and represent the interests of EU citizens and EU-based companies? 4. What immediate action will the Commission take to ensure that EU data protection rules are effectively enforced and that third-country legislation does not take precedence over EU legislation, thereby nullifying the rights and guarantees it provides?
