Question for written answer E-3973/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (7 June 2010) Subject: Abandoned lead and zinc mine in the Kirki region (Alexandroupoli, in the prefecture of Evros) Last week the Medical Department of the University of Thrace published the results of its research on the pollution caused by an abandoned lead and zinc mine in the Kirki region. The mine was constructed during the Second World War, but since then it has operated for only 13 years and since 1997 it has been completely abandoned. Today, there are mineral-rich swamps in the damaged tailings ponds and in the area around the ore-processing plant, while unprocessed ore remains exposed. According to the report, concentrations of heavy metals have been confirmed in the sediment of the River Eirini, which flows into the Sea of Thrace, near the mine, and toxic elements have spread to neighbouring crops. It is also noted that the pollution may be spread by air, dust or the irrigation system. However, it is reported that there is no immediate risk, to farmers and other people living in the region, of exposure to the toxic waste from the mine. Although there is no immediate risk, authorities and residents in the region are calling for the sealing of the mine, the safe burial of the toxic waste, the remediation of the area and the creation of a theme park. In the light of the above considerations, can the Commission answer the following questions: Is the Commission aware of the study in question? What measures does it intend to take in order to protect the health of the residents of the region? Does the Commission know whether any project has been registered with the Regional Operational Programme for Macedonia and Thrace concerning the sealing of the mine, the safe burial of the toxic waste and the remediation of the area?
