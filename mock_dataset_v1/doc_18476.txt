Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (22 March 2011) 1. Articles 19 and 20 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 Regulation (EC) N 0178 /2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1). provide that feed and food business operators are obliged to inform the competent authorities of non-compliant findings. Private laboratories are currently not obliged by EU legislation to notify non‑compliant findings to the competent authorities. The Commission will examine the possibility to introduce such a reporting obligation for all laboratories in a potential package of reinforced dioxin monitoring. 2. On request of the Commission, the European Union Reference Laboratory for Dioxins and PCBs in Feed and Food has issued a report on ‘Analytical capacities of National Reference Laboratories and Official Laboratories in case of dioxin incidents in the feed and food chain’ http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/chemicalsafety/contaminants/dioxins_en.htm . From this report it can be concluded that there is in the EU sufficient analytical capacity to analyse dioxins and PCBs in feed and food with screening and/or confirmatory methods with the analytical result available one week after sampling. 3. A possible measure imposing separation/segregation of fats for technical purposes from fats intended for feed and food at the level of production and transport is under consideration. 4. Feed business operators placing feed on the market have to label it according to the Feed Marketing Regulation Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the placing on the market and use of feed, amending European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and repealing Council Directive 79/373/EEC, Commission Directive 80/511/EEC, Council Directives 82/471/EEC, 83/228/EEC, 93/74/EEC, 93/113/EC and 96/25/EC and Commission Decision 2004/217/EC (OJ L 229, 1.9.2009, p. 1). . Correct labelling of feed and correct use according to the label should avoid such contamination incidents occurring again.
