WRITTEN QUESTION E-3064/08 by Marie-Arlette Carlotti (PSE) to the Commission (2 June 2008) Subject: Implementation of the EDF via multilateral instruments Does the Commission share the view that the implementation of the EDF via multilateral instruments, in areas where there is real added value compared with bilateral aid, can make a crucial contribution towards increasing the effectiveness of the aid? In order to guarantee more predictable flows of funding, does the Commission plan to generalise multi-annual commitments to multilateral bodies? In this respect, what are the Commission’s intentions as regards the multilateral body GAVI Alliance, which has proved its effectiveness in combating infant mortality in the most vulnerable countries?
