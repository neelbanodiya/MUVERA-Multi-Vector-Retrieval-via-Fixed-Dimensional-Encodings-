Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (1 April 2005) The Cohesion Fund has approved two funding decisions concerning the construction of the Aposelemis dam in Crete. The first, issued in 1999, relates to studies and expropriations. The total eligible cost of the co-funded project amounts to about € 10 million, and the rate of Community assistance fixed at 80 %. The second decision was approved on 31 December 2002 and the total eligible project cost amounts to about € 125 million. The rate of Community assistance granted to the project is fixed at 75 %. The project concerns the water supply of the greater Iraklion region and Agios Nikolaos from the Aposelemi dam. Its aim is to tackle the severe problem of insufficient water resources in six municipalities and nineteen villages along the axe of Linoperasma - Iraklio - Xersonnissos - borders of Iraklion and Lasithi - Neapoli,- Saint Nikolaos - Elounta. Works include the construction of a barrage, a reservoir basin, water pipe networks, a water treatment station, technical works, access roads as well as design and studies relating to a rational exploitation of the project. The Commission has already assessed, in the framework of a complaint presented to it, whether the relevant Community environmental legislation had been correctly complied with, i.e. Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment OJ L 175, 5.7.1985 , as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 OJ L 73, 14.3.1997 , and Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992 . The Commission concluded that the project had been submitted to an evaluation with regard to its environmental effects, according to the requirements of Directive 85/337/EEC. The Commission wishes to stress that this Directive does not prohibit projects which are likely to have significant effects on the environment, but it sets out a series of procedures for such projects requiring an environmental impact assessment, mainly the preparation of an environmental impact study, the information of the public and prior consultations with the public and other competent authorities. The environmental terms for the project were approved by Joint Ministerial decisions in 1996 (n° 82663) and in 1999 (n° 109155). In addition, given that the project was likely to
