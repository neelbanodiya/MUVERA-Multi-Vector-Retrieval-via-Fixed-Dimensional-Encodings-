ORAL QUESTION H-0805/03 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Cristina Gutiérrez-Cortines to the Commission Subject: Funding the Natura 2000 network Directive 92/43/EEC on habitats combines ambitious biodiversity protection objectives with the funding of the wherewithal to provide that protection, and its adoption was welcomed by European citizens who own land of major ecological value, since they saw it as an acknowledgement of natural values and an expression of Community solidarity and joint responsibility. As time as gone by, all the obligations laid down in the Directive are falling on the owners of Natura 2000 land, but the subsidies provided for Article 8 of the Directive are not arriving; the result has been rejection of the Directive throughout society, including on the part of the landowners who form part of the Natura 2000 network. Is the Commission aware that the major victim of this passivity is the very biodiversity we are seeking to protect? Is the Commission aware that the delays affecting the initiatives already underway, e.g. the Communication on the Funding of Natura 2000, are exacerbating the negative way in which Natura 2000 is viewed? When does the Commission intend to make the funding mechanism of Natura 2000 operational, and how does it intend to proceed with this funding, provided for in Article 8 of the Directive? What does the Commission intend to do to regain the trust and support of landowners for the Natura 2000 network? OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7.
