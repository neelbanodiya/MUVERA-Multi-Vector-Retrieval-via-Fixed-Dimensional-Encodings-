WRITTEN QUESTION E-1531/10 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (11 March 2010) Subject: External border controls — Poland Owing to numerous wars and high levels of poverty in non-EU countries the protection of the EU's external borders is becoming more important than ever. Since the Schengen Convention permits free transit within the EU, those countries having EU‑external borders (Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia, Finland, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) must protect their borders well. 1. How many persons are deployed by Poland for border control? 2. What is Poland's border control budget? 3. Are there any EU subsidies to Poland for border control? 4. If so, how much does the EU pay to Poland? 5. How many intercepted illegal border crossings are reported each year in Poland? 6. What equipment does the Polish border control service have at its disposal? 7. Is the Commission aware of the deployment of ‘Blackwater organisations’ in Poland? 8. If so, what organisations are deployed for the control of Polish borders?
