Question for written answer E-000910/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Niccolò Rinaldi (ALDE) (14 February 2012) Subject: Waste cycle in Lazio — Pizzo del Prete waste disposal site/incinerator In view of the closure of the Malagrotta waste disposal site, the Lazio Region drafted a document entitled ‘Preliminary analysis to identify suitable areas for the establishment of non-hazardous waste disposal sites in the province of Rome’. One of the sites identified is Pizzo del Prete (Fiumicino, Rome), where it appears that there are plans for an incinerator and/or a waste disposal site. This site seems to be considered ‘preferential’ compared to the other ones identified, despite the fact that it is situated in a landscape and architectural conservation area and that no consultation took place with Lazio’s Cultural and Environmental Heritage Regional Office and Departments, because it has ‘intermodal transport potential’ that would allow easier access for waste deliveries. Moreover, the Pizzo del Prete site belongs to a farm which, in connection with the establishment of a livestock centre (request No 8475903131), obtained 30-35 % funding from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development based on Council Regulation (EC) 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 (Measure 121 — Pif RL014) for a EUR 800 000 short supply chain project. Can the Commission state: — Whether it is possible to prevent a potential waste of EU funds, since, if this choice of site is confirmed, the property of the livestock centre will be expropriated? — Whether the identification of potential sites based on potential capacity is a method that complies with the prevention principle that underpins Directive 2008/98/EC? — Whether measures to ensure public participation in the authorisation process will be taken, as envisaged by Commission Implementing Decision 2011/632/EU that sets out the questionnaire to be used for reports pertaining to the implementation of Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the incineration of waste?
