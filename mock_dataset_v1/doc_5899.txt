Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (27 August 2010) Following the judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union on 10 September 2009 regarding the compliance of derogations adopted by the Maltese authorities permitting spring hunting with the requirements of the Birds Directive Directive 2009/147/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, pp. 7–25. , the Commission can confirm that, in line with all cases where there has been a judgment by the Court, it undertook consultations with the Maltese authorities in order to ensure compliance with the Court's judgment in relation to a proposed spring hunting derogation in 2010 (case reference C-76/08 Commission v Malta dated 10 September 2009). On 9 April 2010 the Commission was informed by the Maltese Government of a draft legislation (which was adopted on the same day) permitting spring hunting of some 7 500 birds in Malta for one week in April 2010. At the same time, the Maltese Government also adopted a framework legislation seeking to permit spring hunting in future years which sets out a higher figure for birds, some 25 000, and provides for a three-week open season. The Commission considers that, in principle, the new legislation permitting spring hunting in 2010 appears to comply with the requirements of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Nevertheless, the Commission has drawn the attention of the Maltese authorities that it is essential to effectively enforce all the conditions set out in the new legislation (duration of the hunting season, number of hunting licences and number of birds to be hunted). In this regard, the Commission requested the Maltese authorities to provide a report on the outcome of the hunting season, notably matter of enforcement/strict controls in practice, following the closure of the season with a view to enable the Commission to assess if the derogation has been implemented fully in line with the directive's requirements and the Court's judgment. In this context, it should also be noted that for the purposes of assessing compliance with the directive's requirements, the Commission may also use any other available information it may receive from citizens and/or non-governmental organisations. In relation to the framework legislation, the Commission is currently assessing the framework legislation for spring hunting in Malta to consider whether
