Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2006) The issue raised by the Honourable Member was already the subject of an oral question ( H‑0013/06 by Mrs Goudin) debated on 9 March 2006 at the plenary session of the Parliament and reference is made to the answer provided by the Commission at this occasion. With his letter of March 2006, referred to by the Honourable Member, the Commission's Vice President responsible for Justice, Freedom and Security transmitted the position taken by the Commission at the Parliament's plenary session to his ministerial colleagues in Member States. The Commission is not aware of any new facts or legal arguments which would require it to change the carefully elaborated and well thought through position taken at this occasion. The Commission wishes to point out that the principle of Community preference is well-known; it is also explicitly set out in paragraph 14 of the country specific annexes containing the transitional arrangements and the need for Member States to respect this principle was recalled in explicit terms in the Commission's report of 8 February 2006 on the functioning of the first phase of the transitional arrangements. It is up to the individual Member States that still apply restrictions on workers during the transitional period to see to it that this principle is respected when filling job vacancies. The Commission has not commissioned any studies on the application of this particular principle in practice, but has reminded Member States as stated above of the need to respect this. Further, in case of complaints of non-respect of this principle, the Commission will fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties. The Honourable Member also raises the question as to whether Community directives relevant to the labour market access of third‑country nationals are applicable during periods when temporary restrictions are applied. The Commission would stress that it is not a matter of the non-applicability of Community legislation but rather an application thereof which is compatible with the Accession Treaties.
