Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (16 April 2009) In response to the question raised by the Honourable Member in relation to Council Directive 1999/22/EC relating to the keeping of wild animals in zoos, the Commission would like to make the following observations: The above Zoo Directive was adopted with the objective to promote the protection and conservation of wild animal species by strengthening the role of zoos in the conservation of biodiversity. This is to be achieved by Member States adopting measures for the licensing and inspection of zoos in order to ensure that zoos respect the conservation measures set out in the directive. The Commission is monitoring that EC legislation such as Council Directive 1999/22/EC is transposed into national legislation and properly implemented. In case of a complaint the Commission will examine the case and, if necessary, legal action will be taken against the Member State not respecting the rules. The Commission will do its utmost to ensure the implementation of the EU acquis in this regard. Moreover, specific concerns related to the keeping of animals in zoos can be addressed by national legislation in accordance with the general provisions of the Treaty. For the time being, the Commission is not considering a revision of Council Directive 1999/22/EC. The Commission may, however, undertake an evaluation of the implementation and the effectiveness of this directive at some point once sufficient experience has been gathered on its implementation, including in the new Member States.
