ministries and embassies, European business and European citizens by organising regular contacts and meetings, providing practical assistance and exchanging Member States' diplomatic personnel and officials of the relevant institutions on a reciprocal basis; 17. Recommends to continue pragmatically to develop and build up the ESDP on the basis of the decisions adopted by the European Council and the Council of Ministers, as has been the case since the St Malo Declaration in 1998; shares the view that these decisions are already covered by the existing treaties (in particular Articles 18(2) and 26 of the Treaty on European Union, under which the Presidency and the High Representative are responsible for implementing decisions taken by the Council pursuant to Article 13(3)) and that they could therefore be put in place prior to, and if necessary also without, the Constitutional Treaty, provided that the necessary transparency and accountability are assured; 18. Proposes to greatly reinforce the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC) both on a personnel and budgetary level so as to better achieve its main objective of general security surveillance and support for Petersberg type missions, treaty verification, arms proliferation control, maritime surveillance and environmental monitoring (including both natural and man-induced disasters); 19. Is convinced in particular that ensuring the democratic accountability and transparency of all activities undertaken by the European Defence Agency is a matter of urgency which does not depend on the coming into force of the new Treaty; is further convinced that setting up the European Civil Peace Corps in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament on several previous occasions is also now feasible; 20. Encourages both the Council and the Member States to further increase de facto parliamentary scrutiny of ESDP, at national level, by enhancing the role played by national parliaments in the authorisation of ESDP operations, and, at European level, by giving the European Parliament a major role in the scrutiny of the entire CFSP budget through a revision of the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement; 21. Asks once more that the Council should not only inform but also regularly consult and involve Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices made on CFSP/ESDP; Preparatory work on the setting up of the External Action Service 22. Stresses that the creation of the new post of EU Minister for Foreign Affairs and building up the future External Action Service (via for example an ad hoc interinstitutional agreement)
