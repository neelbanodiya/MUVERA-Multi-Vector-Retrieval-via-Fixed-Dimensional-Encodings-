Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (3 October 2006) The Commission is strongly committed to giving a positive answer to the requests from Parliament to include Members as observers in the Community delegations negotiating multilateral agreements and in accordance with the framework agreement between the two institutions, Members often form part of Community delegations but on a personal basis. In line with current institutional competences, they are not entitled either to negotiate on behalf of the Community or to be present in the negotiation sessions, which include the coordination meetings. Nevertheless, the Commission keeps Members regularly informed of developments in the negotiations.
