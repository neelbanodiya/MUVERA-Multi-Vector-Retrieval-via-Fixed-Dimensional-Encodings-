Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (3 August 2005) According to European Sea Ports Organisation, container traffic in the Baltic Sea area grew by 14.1 % from 2003 to 2004. This growth was higher than the corresponding average growth of 10.1 % in the European Union (EU). In certain regional markets within the Baltic Sea area, there are some indications that short-sea transport might have slightly decreased between 2004 and 2005 while road transport has been on the increase. One of the reasons for this development can be the new situation that was created through the accession of 10 new Member States to the EU and the consequent opening of frontiers on 1 May 2004. Community legislation is applicable in all Member States. The Commission is vigorously monitoring this requirement and taking measures, if necessary, in accordance with the EC Treaty provisions. The policy to promote short sea shipping in Europe, including the Baltic Sea, aims to shift goods from road to short sea shipping. This policy has been consistently carried out in cooperation with the Member States and industries. Community tools, such as Marco Polo, can assist the industry in the process. The new Member States in the Baltic Sea area are actively involved in this policy and — in line with the other coastal Member States — taking measures to make short sea shipping more attractive and simpler to use. The new initiative on motorways of the sea that was recently added to the trans-European transport network can become a useful tool in improving the preconditions for short-sea transport and making it more attractive to transport users. These motorways of the sea should become comprehensive logistics structures from hinterland to hinterland with short sea shipping in the main role ensuring quality connections between sea motorway ports. The Member States on the Baltic Sea are actively carrying out preparatory work to plan and implement the Baltic motorway of the sea.
