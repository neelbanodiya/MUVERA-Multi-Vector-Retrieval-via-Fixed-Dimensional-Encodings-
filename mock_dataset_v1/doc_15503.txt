Question for written answer P-008258/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Vital Moreira (S&D) (14 September 2011) Subject: Signature of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) by Member States with third countries since December 2009 Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, foreign direct investment is included in the list of matters falling under the common commercial policy. In accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘the Treaty’), the Union has exclusive competence with respect to the common commercial policy. Accordingly, only the Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts within that area. The Member States are able to do so only if empowered by the Union, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty. The regulation establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries is still under negotiation between the Council and the European Parliament. Yet, according to data published by UNCTAD (in the quarterly publication Investment Policy Monitor and in the 2011 World Investment Report), at least 11 Member States have concluded new or renegotiated existing BITs with third countries, in complete violation of the Treaty. Is the Commission aware of this fact? Have Member States consulted or at least informed the Commission about the abovementioned BITs? What kind of action is the Commission planning to take in order to bring the Member States' actions into conformity with the Treaty?
