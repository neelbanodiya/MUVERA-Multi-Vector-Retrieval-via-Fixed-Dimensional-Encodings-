on the situation in Iraq OJ C 77 E, 26.3.2004, p. 226. and its resolution of 6 July 2005 on "The European Union and Iraq – A Framework for Engagement" Texts Adopted, P6_TA(2005)0228 . which request that EC funds for reconstruction in Iraq be managed by the UN; criticises the Commission for accepting that a considerable share of the Community contribution be managed by the World Bank ; notes that appropriations granted under the 2004 and 2005 budgets have only marginally been absorbed by the Bank and on this basis takes the view that no further funding will be required by the Bank during 2006; reminds the Commission that the World Bank relies on the Iraqi authorities for the implementation of its programmes; points out in this respect the weak administrative structure and repeated instances of corruption in Iraq; requests therefore that no further funding be channelled to the World Bank and that other European intermediaries be considered for the disbursement of these funds; calls on the Commission to carry out during 2006 an independent audit on the use of EC funds by the UN and the World Bank; 12. Calls on the Commission to ensure, within the framework of the MEDA and EIDHR programmes, that sufficient resources are allocated to consolidate democratic institutions in Lebanon and to support Lebanon's efforts towards restoring its territorial integrity, full sovereignty and political independence; Central Asia 13. Emphasises the Union's continuing political and financial support for the establishment of a peaceful, democratic and economically viable state in Afghanistan; urges the Commission to play a mediating role between the Afghan authorities and the non-governmental organisations with a view to facilitating cooperation between the two sides in managing reconstruction efforts; Latin America 14. Takes note of the fact that reconstruction aid for damage caused by Hurricane Mitch expires at the end of 2005; is nevertheless of the opinion that the conclusion of association agreements with Chile and Mexico and the stepping up of political contacts between the EU and Latin American countries, as witnessed by the recent Interparliamentary Conference in Lima, plead in favour of a sustained financial commitment towards this region; therefore restores to the level of the 2005 budget the appropriations earmarked for cooperation with Latin American countries.
