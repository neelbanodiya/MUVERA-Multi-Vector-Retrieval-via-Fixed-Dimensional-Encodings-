Question for written answer E-004070/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Peter van Dalen (ECR) (5 May 2011) Subject: Waste transport Transportation of waste in Europe is subject to strict conditions pursuant to Directive 2008/98/EC and Regulation No 1013/2006/EC. Carriers must register before being permitted to transport waste in a given Member State. The European Union Member States do not apply the same conditions to this registration requirement. As a result, it is not clear to carriers what conditions they are or are not required to comply with, while this state of affairs also generates unnecessarily heavy administrative burdens for carriers. 1. Is the Commission aware of the existence of the differing requirements for registration in the Member States for transportation of waste in the European Union? 2. What view does the Commission take of these differences in relation to the functioning of the internal transport market? Does it consider the internal market to be unnecessarily restricted at present? If not, why not? 3. Does the Commission consider that a system of mutual recognition on the basis of high, strict quality standards for waste carriers could usefully supplement the current registration system for waste transport? 4. Does the Commission consider it necessary to put an end to this restriction of the internal market? If not, why not? If so, how will it seek to eliminate this restriction of the internal market?
