Reply (22 October 2007) The EU has over the years worked to support peace and stability in Somalia by supporting an inclusive political dialogue among Somalis and by the implementation of the Transitional Federal Charter of Somalia. The EU also supports the implementation of the resolutions made at the National Reconciliation Congress in Mogadishu. The EU has given financial and technical support to the African Union Mission in Somalia, Amisom. The Council has recently underlined the necessity of additional EU support, including financial contributions, to Amisom and the need to encourage further deployment to Amisom by AU Member States (Council Conclusions of 14-15 May 2007). Further deployment of troops to Amisom in parallel with progress in the political process is the key to stabilising the situation in Somalia. It is also the key to enabling Ethiopia to withdraw from Somalia. The Council has encouraged more political engagement with Somalia from the UN, and supports the ongoing contingency planning by the UN to take over from Amisom.
