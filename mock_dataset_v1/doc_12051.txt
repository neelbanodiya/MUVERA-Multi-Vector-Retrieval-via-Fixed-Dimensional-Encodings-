9999/C Q999 E/027 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1004/04 by Daniel Hannan (PPE-DE) to the Commission (23 March 2004) Subject: Threat to peace and democracy in Adjara The autonomous Georgian region of Adjara, which is self-governing in accordance with the Georgian Constitution, survived thirteen years of threats to its peace and stability from the ousted regime of Eduard Shevardnadze. Now, in 2004, Adjara, which fully acknowledges the overall authority of the central government in Tbilisi, faces renewed threats of destabilisation from the recently-elected government of President Mikhail Saakashvili. On Sunday, 14 March, armoured personnel carriers and heavily armed troops appeared at the administrative border of Adjara. It is feared that such attempts are being made with a view to undermining the due process of the forthcoming parliamentary elections (on 27 March 2004). Would the Commission agree that regional issues should be resolved through peaceful dialogue without the threat of military force; that elections are best conducted in an atmosphere of stability and trust; and that the appearance of the Georgian National Guard on the streets of a hitherto peaceful and economically successful region, where the President's party has little support, would constitute an act of aggression against the citizens of Georgia by their own government?
