WRITTEN QUESTION E-5648/09 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (24 November 2009) Subject: In-flight safety EC law states that mobile telephones must be switched off on commercial aircraft in flight. What evidence does the Commission have that there is a danger implicit in their use for telephone conversations? And has the Commission considered the development of systems to block GSM signals for those of us who forget to switch off their phones?
