WRITTEN QUESTION E-1749/04 by Charles Tannock (PPE-DE) and Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE) to the Council (17 August 2004) Subject: Possible trade sanctions against Burma It is widely held that foreign investment in Burma enriches the military government and therefore fuels oppression of the Burmese peoples. Will the Council support measures to push for EU wide investment sanctions against Burma? If agreement cannot be reached with other major economic powers such as the United States and Japan would it support implementing investment sanctions unilaterally?
