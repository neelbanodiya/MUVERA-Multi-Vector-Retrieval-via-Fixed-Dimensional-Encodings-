and with non-EU Members. On this basis, the Commission does not think it is necessary to establish another flood prevention mechanism at the European level. Moreover, European forecasting systems are already being developed, notably the European Flood Alert System (EFAS). The need to reduce the risk from floods has been taken into account in the 3rd Community support framework (2000‑06) and the current National Strategic Reference Framework and the Operational Programmes submitted by Greece for the programming period 2007‑13. During the Programming Period 2000‑06, EUR 864 201.28 has been spent to co-finance flood defence infrastructures in the rivers Evros, Ardas and Erythropotamos together with their side rivers. Flood defence infrastructures could be co-financed through the National Strategic Reference Framework, either under the Operational Programme for the Environment or the relevant Regional Operational Programme, provided that they meet the established eligibility criteria. However, it is up to the Greek authorities to propose, prepare and carry out such projects. It goes without saying that the effectiveness of measures for the period 2007‑13 can only be assessed at a later stage. As announced by the communication on a Community approach on disaster prevention COM(2009)82 final. , the Commission is assessing the possibility of further integrating disaster prevention into existing funding. It has launched at the end of 2009 an external study to provide it with a critical analysis of the financial instruments which currently support Member States' action in the field of disaster prevention. The study will also analyse potential improvements to the instruments and provide recommendations with a view to better sharing information.
