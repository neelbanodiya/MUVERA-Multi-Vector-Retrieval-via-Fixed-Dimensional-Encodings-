Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (9 September 2008) Article 54 of the remedies accepted by the Commission in case SUEZ- Suez-Gaz de France (GDF) http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/mergers/cases/decisions/m4180_20061114_20600_fr.pdf page 303 stipulates that the merged entity, SUEZ‑GDF, would not control Fluxys S.A. and its board of directors. In accordance with Article 52 of the same remedies, SUEZ/GDF will propose that Fluxys S.A. will be nominated as sole operator of various assets, including the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal. However, Articles 61 and 62 specify that ownership of the LNG terminal will reside with Fluxys International S.A., a company in which SUEZ/GDF will hold a 60 % stake. SUEZ/GDF has however undertaken to grant Fluxys S.A. the usage rights on the LNG terminal required to exercise its function as the LNG terminals' operator. Consequently, it appears compatible with the remedies that ownership of the LNG terminal resides with Fluxys International in which SUEZ/GDF has a majority stake. The operation of the terminal should however reside with Fluxys S.A.
