Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (11 June 2007) The press quote referred to in the Honourable Member's question is incorrect. The Member of the Commission responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs said, in fact, that ‘the Internal Market and the EMU have boosted trade and investment flows within the EU… and the introduction of the euro has boosted trade within the euro-area.’ The Commissioner qualified his remark by stressing that the benefits from EU integration are far from exhausted. The sizeable positive effect of the introduction of the euro on intra-euro-area trade is well established in academic research and documented in Commission publications.
