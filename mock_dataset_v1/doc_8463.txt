2004/C 33 E/180 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1849/03 by Kyösti Virrankoski (ELDR) to the Commission (26 May 2003) Subject: Buying and selling of farms and agricultural reform The Commission proposal to reform EU agricultural policy provides for, among other things, single farm support decoupled from production. The amount of support would be determined according to the CAP aids paid in the years from 2000 to 2002. The support would not be linked to the land area. The proposal has led to great uncertainty among farmers who are buying or selling farmland because it is not clear from the text proper, any more than from other documents, what proportion of the single farm support, if any, is passed on when a farm changes hands. The same problem applies to land tenancy. There is also a question mark over farming partnerships. For example, a farm might have been run during the reference period on a partnership basis, and received the corresponding agricultural support, but later, following a transfer of ownership, the land might have been divided among the partners and the partnership might have ceased to exist. The problem affects the whole of EU territory, irrespective of the Member State, and has been brought about entirely by the Commission. Hundreds of thousands of farmers are facing a dilemma. Farmers do not dare and do not know how to draw up deeds of sale, tenancy agreements, or partnership agreements. The situation is causing difficulties particularly for young farmers who are in the process of buying or extending their farms. What steps will the Commission take to dispel the current confusion? What kind of clause should be included in a deed of sale, partnership agreement, or tenancy agreement if the intention is to share out the CAP aid for the farm to be made over in proportion to the land areas?
