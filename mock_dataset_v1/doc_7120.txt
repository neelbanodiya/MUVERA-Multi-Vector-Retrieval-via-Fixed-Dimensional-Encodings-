Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (19 June 2008) On the occasion of the EU-Central Asia Ministerial Troika of 9-10 April 2008 in Ashgabad, Turkmenistan, Troika members had bilateral meetings with the President Berdymuhamedov of Turkmenistan. In these meetings, the President indicated that there is gas available in Turkmenistan to supply the European Union. This was followed up on 26 May 2008, when a Memorandum of Understanding on Energy was signed in Ashgabad between Turkmenistan and the EU. The full text thereof is public and can be found on the web site of the Commission. This is an important indication in support of European projects such as the Nabucco pipeline. However, it is the role of the companies, not the Commission, to follow up on the commercial details and practicalities.
