concentration and market segmentation of the food retail and distribution sectors in the EU. The Food Task Force produced a first report of its findings in the communication ‘Food Prices in Europe — including a roadmap to improve the functioning of the food supply chain’ adopted in December 2008 COM(2008)821 final. . This second Communication proposed a roadmap to improve the functioning of the food supply chain consisting of five main sets of measures: — promoting the competitiveness of the food supply chain to increase resilience to world price shocks; — ensuring a vigorous and coherent enforcement of competition and consumer protection rules in the food supply markets by the Commission and National Competition and Consumer authorities; — reviewing regulations that have been identified as restrictive, both at national and EU level and enhancing regulatory harmonisation in cases where regulations continue to fragment the Single Market; — providing better information to consumers, public authorities and market operators by setting up a permanent European monitoring of food prices and the supply chain; — taking measures to discourage speculation to the detriment of commercial operators in agricultural commodity markets. The work of the Food Task Force is ongoing and a progress report will be presented to the Council by the end of 2009, reporting on the implementation of the roadmap and providing further analysis on price formation and the interplay of market operators in the food sector.
