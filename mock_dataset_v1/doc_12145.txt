The proposed reform on the Council voting system seem to remain as the biggest hurdle and is likely to keep negotiators working right up to the last moment. Spain and Poland reiterated their stance against double majority voting. However, negotiations on some of the thorniest issues of the draft Constitution made significant strides forward at Naples, especially on defence policy. Preparation of the European Council, 12-13 December Brussels Council & Commission statements - Preparation of the European Council (Brussels, 12-13 December 2003), including the social summit The plenary session will formally start with Council and Commission statements on preparations for the European Council (including the European Social Forum) to be held on 12-13 December. The two-day summit is likely to be dominated by the Heads of State and Government negotiating what could be the final changes to the draft Constitutional Treaty. There are many issues still outstanding. To mention just a few, there is the question of whether to make reference to the EU's Christian inheritance, the definition of qualified majority voting, the composition and voting rights of the Commission, the role of the new " Foreign Minister ", the minimum number of MEPs per Member State, the inter-institutional balance with regard to the budget and how to revise the Treaties in the future.
