Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (18 December 2006) Article 8(4) first sentence of Directive 91/439/EEC Council Directive 91/439/EEC of 29 July 1991 on driving licences, OJ L 237, 24.8.1991, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the Parliament and of the Council, OJ L 284, 31.10.2003. defines the conditions under which a Member State may refuse the recognition of a driving licence issued by another Member State. The European Court of Justice has ruled in Case C‑476-01 Case C‑476/01, judgment of the Court (Fifth Chamber) of 29 April 2004. that a Member State is not to refuse to recognise the validity of a driving licence issued by another Member State on the grounds that its holder has been subject to a measure withdrawing or cancelling the driving licence, if the time period of the ban has elapsed before the issuance of the new licence. On the question of medical examination, the European Court of Justice decided the Case C‑227/053 Case C‑227/05 order of the Court of 6 April 2006. and made reference to the circumstances referred to. If a licence has been obtained in a proper way and there are no new conditions that would justify a new test of the holder's aptitude to drive, the licence has to be recognised. Once the Third Driving Licence Directive has entered into force, Article 11 (4) second sentence will require that ‘A Member State shall refuse to recognise the validity of any driving licence issued by another Member State to a person whose driving licence is restricted, suspended or withdrawn in the former State's territory.’ The Commission welcomes the clarifications brought about by the jurisprudence, as these and the forthcoming third directive developments should bring about greater road safety.
