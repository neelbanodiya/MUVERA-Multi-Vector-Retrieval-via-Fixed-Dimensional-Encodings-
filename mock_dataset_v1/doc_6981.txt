ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0039/05 pursuant to Rule 108 of the Rules of Procedure by Pedro Guerreiro , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group to the Commission Subject: Integration of China in the WTO The textiles and clothing sector employs 2.7 million workers in the EU and is mainly concentrated in more disadvantaged regions. It has been severely hit by the process of liberalisation at international level, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs and companies in the process. With the liberalisation of international trade in textiles and clothing resulting from the expiry of the Textiles and Clothing Agreement on 1 January 2005, and China's WTO integration in December 2001, the situation has worsened. The increase in the number of licence applications is an indication of the scale of the growth of imports from China, which will have a devastating impact on the textiles and clothing sector. Does the Commision agree that the increase in textile and clothing imports from China will have serious consequences for this sector in the EU? Does it agree that the special safeguard clause under Article 1(1) of Regulation (EC) 138/2003 must be implemented immediately to attenuate or avoid a crisis in this sector? Does it intend to put forward a Community programme, with appropriate financial resources and support measures, for the textiles and clothing sector, as proposed by Parliament in its resolution of 29 January 2004 (paragraph 3) on the future of this sector? More generally, does it not consider that, rather than continue to insist in WTO negotiations on liberalising trade in one sector after another and thereby undermining social and environmental rights, it should give priority to ensuring that trade leads to an improvement in social and environmental conditions, in particular by respecting social and environmental standards which promote sustainable development?
