Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (20 October 2008) Directive 2008/1/EC OJ L 24, 29.1.2008. concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (the IPPC Directive) requires installations falling under its scope to operate in accordance with permits. Permits include emission limit values based on best available techniques (BAT),which are designed to prevent and, where that is not practicable, generally to reduce emissions and the impact to the environment as a whole. Existing installations, (namely those that were already in operation before 30 October 1999), were required to comply with the requirements of the IPPC Directive by 30 October 2007 at the latest. The Commission is aware of shortcomings regarding the implementation of the IPPC Directive in Spain. Consequently, the Commission has launched an infringement procedure on 8 May 2008 against Spain. The Spanish authorities' response to the letter of formal notice is currently being analysed. The Commission will take all necessary measures to ensure full implementation of the IPPC Directive.
