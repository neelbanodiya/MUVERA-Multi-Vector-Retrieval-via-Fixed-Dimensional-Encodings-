WRITTEN QUESTION E-3268/04 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 December 2004) Subject: Threat to a Natura Biotope from planned construction of a water-hungry golf course in the south of Crete where water is scarce Plans are being drawn up to construct a water-hungry golf course and a hotel unit at Apigania Lesithi on 4337 ares of unspoilt coastal woodland with public access which is included in the Natura 2000 network, Reg. No GR4320005. The area is under particular geoclimatic stress, with very low rainfall and high temperatures, and constitutes the only area of coastal woodland on the south coast of the prefecture with free public access for recreational purposes. Scientists estimate that the amount of water required to operate the golf course would be at least 300 cubic metres per hour ( 7200 cubic metres of water in each 24-hour period). As some inhabitants of the region and ecological organisations in Crete have objected to this planned work, can the Commission inform me whether the necessary environmental impact assessment has been carried out for this project, whether it has been published in time, pursuant to Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40 , and whether the Commission intends to take steps to ensure that the region’s environment does not suffer irreparable damage?
