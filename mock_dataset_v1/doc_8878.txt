implementing rules other than the technical measures explicitly mentioned in this Regulation , (20) This Regulation defers many essential decisions to multi-annual strategic programmes and national annual work programmes. These issues are of critical concern to individual Member States and of crucial importance for their national environmental policy. It is therefore appropriate for certain measures to be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure provided for in Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC, in order to give Member States the option of bringing proposed measures before the Council for consideration. The regulatory procedure is also appropriate for the laying down of implementing rules other than the technical measures explicitly mentioned in this Regulation. The regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission 1 should apply to the adoption and the possible amendment of multi-annual strategic programmes drawn up in accordance with Article 6(1) of this Regulation and to the adoption of amendments to the Annex to this Regulation, which specify important provisions, in particular the measures eligible for funding, so as to enable the two arms of the legislative authority to scrutinise such measures before they are adopted. 1 OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. 1 OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23. Decision as amended by the Council Decision of 17 July 2006 (2006/512/EC) (OJ L 200, 22.7.2006, p. 11). Justification Consistency with earlier amendments. This is a consequential amendment to the amendments on Article 14(2) and Article 15(1). Amendment 6 Article 3, paragraph 2 a (new) 2a. The Commission shall ensure that inter-regional and cross-border projects will be considered in the national annual work programmes, especially where cross-border cooperation is essential to guarantee species conservation. Justification Partly reinstating amendment 14 from first reading. Transnational and interregional projects are a prime example of European added value and should be promoted. There is a risk that with the programming approach and the disappointing small budget for LIFE+, there is a disincentive for member states to approve transnational projects as this is ‘money going to the neighbours’. The Commission should therefore ensure cross-border projects will continue to be financed. Amendment 7 Article 4, paragraph 2, point (c a) (new) (ca) to contribute to development and effective implementation of policies to tackle the threat to nature and biodiversity posed by climate
