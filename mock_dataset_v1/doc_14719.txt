Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2010) The Commission informs the Honourable Member that a number of measures have been taken to address the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) needs of older people as part of the action plan on ‘Ageing Well in the Information Society http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/policy/ageing/action_plan/index_en.htm ’. These measures will have a longer term impact by raising awareness, improving coordination and best practice sharing, stimulating innovation and promoting a concerted research effort across the EU. In order to improve awareness, a European best practice portal has been established http://www.epractice.eu with a considerable number of cases related to ICT and ageing. A first set of eInclusion awards were given in 2008 http://www.e-inclusionawards.eu/ and two major ministerial events were held in Lisbon in 2007 and Vienna in 2008 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/events/index_en.htm to discuss necessary policy developments. To improve coordination, a multi-stakeholder innovation platform has been set up through the Aaliance project http://www.aalliance.eu . As basis for further benchmarking between Member States, a study was completed in 2008 to provide an overview of the trends in usage of ICT products and services by elderly people http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/docs/swa2finalreport.pdf and another study analysing the current market conditions and barriers in 10 representative European countries, the US and Japan is under way http://www.ict-ageing.eu/ . To accelerate take-up of existing solutions, a set of 11 large pilot projects related to ICT and ageing are launched with involvement of more than 40 European regions, linking to use of Structural Funds and providing socioeconomic evidence of the impact http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/einclusion/research/projects/index_en.htm#CIP_projects . To prepare for the future, research and innovation is boosted to foster the emergence of innovative, ICT-based products, services and systems for Europe's ageing population. Between now and 2013, the EU, Member States and the private sector will invest more than EUR 1 billion in research and innovation for ageing well: some EUR 600 million in the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) Joint Programme http://www.aal_europe.eu , of which EUR 150 million from the EU's 7th Research Framework Programme (FP7); a further EUR 400 million from FP7 is expected for funding of other projects on ageing. The decision on the participation of the Commission to the AAL Programme was adopted by the European Parliament and Council in first reading and has in the mean time led to two calls for proposals and an investment by Member States that is 50 % over their minimally required financial commitment.
