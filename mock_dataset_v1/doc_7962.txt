WRITTEN QUESTION P-2419/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (3 April 2009) Subject: Online services offered by Ryanair Companies providing air travel services have developed techniques that enable on‑line booking and check‑in. An immediate example of this is Ryanair and the ‘Web Check‑In’ service, which allows travellers to save time by avoiding needless queuing at the airline’s ticket desk and to pay a lower price. The problems come when it is impossible for travellers to access the ‘Web Check‑In’ service that the Irish company offers on its own website. The server is often overloaded, making the service inaccessible. The consequence of being unable to access the ‘Web Check‑In’ service is that an excess fee of EUR 10 must be paid when checking in using the standard procedure. Is it right that this excess fee should have to be paid whenever a passenger, through no fault of their own, is unable to check in on‑line? If the site is inaccessible owing to problems connected with the company’s web page or server, it should not be the traveller who pays. 1. How, therefore, will the Commission tackle this situation? 2. Does it not feel that travellers should be shielded against these kind of malfunctions?
