WRITTEN QUESTION E-0020/05 by Riitta Myller (PSE) to the Commission (13 January 2005) Subject: Calculation of regional population densities The European Commission is using land surface area for the calculation of regional population densities. As a result, the vast lake districts of East Finland, for example, have been totally disregarded, even though lakes permanently hinder interactions between people and the transport of goods. Has the European Commission considered calculating the population density on the basis of the total surface area instead of just the land surface area?
