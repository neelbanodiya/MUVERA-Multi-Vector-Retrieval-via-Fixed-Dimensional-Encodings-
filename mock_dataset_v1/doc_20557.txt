WRITTEN QUESTION E-1142/07 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (8 March 2007) Subject: Discrimination in splitting Pension Share orders upon divorce The Commission will be aware that the current Welfare Reform and Pensions Act (1999) in the UK requires any person receiving a share from a primary pension scheme to wait until they reach 65 before they receive payment upon divorce. In the case of the Armed forces pension scheme, the ex-serviceperson is able to receive his/her share on divorce before the age of 65 whilst the former spouse, irrespective of the length of marriage, is unable to claim his/hers until the age of 65. Currently this caveat disproportionately affects former wives of servicemen. In view of this, is the Commission able to intervene to secure that in the event of divorce, spouses of former military personnel are not discriminated against?
