Votes At Long Last - Agreement on Cosmetic Products Dagmar ROTH-BEHRENDT (PES, D) Report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products (PE-CONS 3668/2002 – C5-0557/2002 – 2000/0077(COD)) Doc.: A5-0001/2003 Procedure : Codecision procedure (3rd reading) Debate : 15.01.2003 Vote: 15.01.2003 Vote Parliament approved a conciliation agreement between Parliament and Council on cosmetics. The agreement means that the ban on animal testing and sales would start immediately where alternative non-animal tests are available. This will be followed by a complete ban six years after the directive enters into force, thereby ending the use of animals in the testing of cosmetic products but without jeopardising consumer safety since alternative ways of testing will have to be developed in the transition period to replace animal testing. The other main points of the agreement reached in conciliation can be summarised as follows: A test and marketing ban will come into effect six years after the entry into force of the directive, i.e. 2009, for the large majority of tests; For those three tests for which there are no alternatives yet under consideration a marketing ban shall come into effect within ten years after entry into force, i.e. 2013; Any prolongation of the 2013 deadline will be decided by codecision between Council and Parliament; Alternative methods of testing shall be validated and adopted at the Community level "with due regard to the development of validation within the OECD"; A ban on certain substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction; The qualitative and quantitative composition of the cosmetic product as well as information on undesirable effects on human health should be easily accessible to the public; and Enhanced labelling requirements for substances which may cause allergic reactions.
