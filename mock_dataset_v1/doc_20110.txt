IPPC installations falling under the scope of Directive 2000/76/EC OJ L 332, 28.12.2000. of the Parliament and of the Council, of 4 December 2000, on the incineration of waste, compliance with the emission limit values laid down in Directive 2000/76/EC is a necessary but not sufficient condition for overall compliance. As stated in Article 18(1) of the IPPC Directive, the emission limit values set in Directive 2000/76/EC ‘shall be applied as minimum emission limit values pursuant to’ the IPPC Directive. As regards the specific situation of the nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions in cement plants co-incinerating waste, this legal requirement can not be altered by the fact that a so-called ‘split-view’ was recorded in the BREF on cement and lime. As regards the interaction with Directive 2003/87/EC OJ L 275, 25.10.2003. of the Parliament and of the Council, of 13 October 2003, establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, this directive amended Article 9(3) of the IPPC Directive stating that a permit issued under the IPPC Directive shall not include an emission limit value for direct emissions of a greenhouse gas, specified in Annex I of Directive 2003/87/EC. Furthermore, Member States may choose not to impose requirements in an IPPC permit relating to energy efficiency.
