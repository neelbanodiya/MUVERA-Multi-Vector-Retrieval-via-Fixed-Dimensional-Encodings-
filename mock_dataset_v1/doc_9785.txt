Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) Concerning the Honourable Member's question regarding the opportunity in principle for the Commission to generate advertising revenues from its web pages, the Commission would like to stress that those are public information websites for an institution having responsibility for the development of policies and rules under which the private sector operates. The advertising of particular private sector companies or products on these pages would therefore seem inappropriate. As for the other issue raised, the Commission would suggest to the Honourable Member to inform Mr Dan Lewis of London's Economic Research Council that it cannot undertake, for the purpose of answering a written question, the lengthy and costly research that would be required to provide him with the information requested.
