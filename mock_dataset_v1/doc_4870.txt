14.3.1997. and Directive 2003/35/EEC Directive 2003/35/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC and 96/61/EC, OJ L 156, 25.6.2003. . Therefore, any kind of change or extension of the project that may have significant adverse effects on the environment falls within Annex II point 13 of the abovementioned Directive. For projects included in Annex II of this directive, Member States shall determine if these changes are likely to have significant effects on the environment before agreeing on them. If this is the case, these modifications will be subject to an environmental impact assessment (EIA). However, according to the available information, the modifications of the port of Granadilla carried out during the planning process were not an extension but a reduction of the port surface and infrastructures. In that case, it should be considered that the reduction approved by the Spanish authorities does not represent a significant adverse effect on the environment. The Commission has contacted the Spanish authorities to request further clarifications regarding the development of the project including the foreseen mitigation and compensation measures.
