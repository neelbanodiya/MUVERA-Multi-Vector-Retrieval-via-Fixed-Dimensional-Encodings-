Answer given by High Representative/Vice President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (30 August 2010) The case of three EU citizens with dual United Kingdom (UK)/Pakistan nationality who were murdered while on a family visit in Pakistan is very tragic indeed. The Commission notes the Honourable Member’s concern that EU citizens with dual UK/Pakistan nationality might be particularly vulnerable to attacks, particularly given the current security challenges in large parts of Pakistan. As far as the protection of EU citizens with dual nationality and their consular support in Pakistan is concerned, it would appear that this matter is currently not covered by EU legislation and falls within the responsibility of the UK High Commission. The Commission will bring the matter to the attention of the Head of the EU Delegation in Islamabad with a request to raise this case with EU colleagues for possible follow-up with the Pakistan authorities.
