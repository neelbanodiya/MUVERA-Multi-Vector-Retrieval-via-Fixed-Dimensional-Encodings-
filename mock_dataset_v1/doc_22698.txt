WRITTEN QUESTION E-5059/07 by Lambert van Nistelrooij (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (15 October 2007) Subject: Impact of the recent enlargement on EU cohesion policy from a budgetary point of view Last week the Commission reported on the situation with regard to absorption by the EU Member States of structural funds allocated to them in the period 2000‑06. The analysis shows that the absorption capacity of the new Member States is modest (between 41 and 69 %). On the other hand, some of the ‘older’ Member States also showed modest results in terms of actual use of EU structural funds during the period in question. The figures for the Netherlands and Greece were, for example, respectively 54 and 58 %. How does the Commission view this low level of absorption? What steps will the Commission be taking to substantially improve absorption in the new period 2007‑13?
