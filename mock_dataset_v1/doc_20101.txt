of both the Commission and the majority of the industry that plans to reduce the capacity of the over-sized Community fleet, chiefly structured around MAGPs, the fourth programme of which ends in 2001, have proved a failure. This was entirely foreseeable given the fact that they were poorly adjusted to the real situation from the very start. This was due to two determining factors: the modest nature of the objectives set, which were far-removed from the real needs as regards reducing fishing effort in line with the state of stocks, and the lack of real will on the part of some member countries to adopt the measures required for their application. With regard to monitoring, it must be pointed out that there will be little point in setting TACs in line with the precautionary principle if there is then no intention of checking that they are complied with and the necessary human and material resources are not available. The current situation is characterised by a high degree of laxity as regards application of Community rules, which are interpreted in different and indeed discriminatory ways by the various inspection services belonging to Member State administrations, whose activities are basically focused on port landings, with little more than token checks being carried out on land transport and marketing after the first sale. On the subject of discards, it must be recognised that consideration needs to be given to whether or not the current rules should be maintained, bearing in mind that it appears to be a proven fact that their application leads to the destruction of huge quantities of fishery products which are thrown back into the sea, representing a tremendous waste of food which is of no use whatever to the population if it does not enter the marketing circuit in the normal way and which certainly does not prevent the destruction and waste of marine resources. To sum up, adopting the precautionary principle for setting total allowable catches is both praiseworthy and necessary, but this alone will not bring about the much-needed improvement as regards fish stocks unless it is considered in a wider context embracing vital issues of fisheries policy which have been poorly or insufficiently resolved and which must be tackled. This would appear to be the right time to do so, since we are in a crucial period during which there is a legal mandate for the
