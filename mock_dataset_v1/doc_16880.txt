WRITTEN QUESTION E-5397/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (7 October 2008) Subject: Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish army of occupation In early September a number of Turkish Cypriot youths expressed their wish for the withdrawal from Cyprus of the Turkish army of occupation by writing relevant slogans on walls in the Turkish-occupied northern part of the island. Several of these youths were subsequently arrested, ill-treated and brought before a Service Court in occupied Nicosia, accused, as far as I know, of charges relating to denigrating Turkishness. Is the Commission aware of this happening? Could the Commission convey to the Turkish Government, which controls the Turkish forces of occupation of Cyprus (including the occupation ‘police’) that such heavy-handed treatment of young people expressing their wish to live in a free, European social environment is to be condemned and is quite unacceptable by EU standards? And that it is imperative for all charges against these young people to be dropped?
