WRITTEN QUESTION E-4709/09 by Charles Goerens (ALDE) to the Commission (7 October 2009) Subject: Danger of civil war in Southern Sudan Have the ghosts of the past returned to haunt Southern Sudan? The media report that 102 people, including 51 civilians, were killed in violent clashes during the weekend of 19-20 September in this region, which experienced more than 20 years of civil war between north and south from 1983 to 2005. The UN notes with concern that the death toll in the region is currently higher than in Darfur, the region in the west of Sudan which has for six years been in the grip of bloody conflict. Violence between tribes, often motivated by cattle stealing, disputes over natural resources and revenge attacks are everyday occurrences in Southern Sudan. Since the beginning of the year, however, the large number of killings and the increase in attacks targeting women and children have given rise to fears of civil war in Southern Sudan itself. In response to fears of a new civil war in Southern Sudan, what does the Commission intend to do to prevent violence against civilians (especially targeted attacks on women and children)? Does this violence not jeopardise the peace agreement which, in 2005, signalled the end of the civil war between the north and the south which had cost two million lives, and provided for general (presidential, parliamentary and regional) elections in Sudan in April 2010, followed by a referendum on independence for Southern Sudan in 2011?
