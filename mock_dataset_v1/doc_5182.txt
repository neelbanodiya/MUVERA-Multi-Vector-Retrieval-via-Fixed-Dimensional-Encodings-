Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (5 December 2011) Both the freedom of religion and equality between women and men are fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, its provisions are addressed to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. The concrete situation referred to by the Honourable Members does however not seem to imply acts by a Member State in the course of implementation of European Union law. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its concern about all kinds of abuse and violence against children and women. The Commission has also funded dozen of projects under the ‘Daphne programme’ since its creation in 1997, aiming at the prevention of violence and abuse of children and women in the European Union See the Daphne Toolkit website: http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/daphnetoolkit/html/booklets/dpt_booklets_en.html . As regards the general issue of the Sharia, the Commission recalls that ‘Sharia’ is a general concept that encompasses several legal aspects and is the subject of varying interpretations both in the countries where it is applied and among specialists. The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answers to Written Questions E‑1463/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sidesSearch/sipadeMapUrl.do?L=EN&PROG=QP&SORT_ORDER=DAA&REF_QP=2011-1463&F_REF_QP=1463/2011&S_RANK=%&LEG_ID=7 , E‑7763/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E‑2011- 007763+0+DOC+XML+V0//FR&language=FR and E‑8433/2011 Not yet published. . Moreover, as already stated in its answer to Written Question E‑5271/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getAllAnswers.do?reference=E‑2011-005271&language=FR , the Commission strongly warns against stigmatising any religious or ethnic communities.
