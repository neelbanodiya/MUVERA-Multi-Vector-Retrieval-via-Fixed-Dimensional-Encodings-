project, e-maritime , the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, climate change, in the analysis of the safety of offshore oil and gas installations and combating pollution ; Justification The Blue Belt project offers customs authorities the assurance that a ship declaring intra-EU goods has only visited EU ports. It offers a way of reducing the administrative burden on short-sea shipping while maintaining existing levels of control. This, in turn, promotes the use of a transport mode which causes less environmental damage than road transport. Similarly, allowing data about ships that are sea-going as well as operating on rivers/canals to pass smoothly between the two systems will reduce administrative burdens.
