Commission is developing a new web-based tool, the EU Compass for Action on Mental Health and Well-being http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/life_style/mental/mental_health_compass_en.htm . The Compass is a tool for the exchange of information on mental health issues and activities across the EU. It comprises a database of policies and good practices identified in Member States as well as information about stakeholder initiatives including policy recommendations, declarations and commitments of main actors. The Compass will be developed in parallel with the thematic conferences.
