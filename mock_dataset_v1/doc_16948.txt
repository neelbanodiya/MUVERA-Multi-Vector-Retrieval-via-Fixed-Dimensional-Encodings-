spirit drinks" - was rejected by MEPs as superfluous and discriminatory. On the basis that the regulation's purpose is to maintain a high standard for all spirit drinks, MEPs rejected the idea that category A "spirits" should be regarded as of higher quality than category B and C "spirit drinks". Preserving co-decision for the definition of spirits The committee believes that the definition of spirit drinks should continue to be governed by the Parliament-Council co-decision procedure. It therefore voted to incorporate Annex II of the draft regulation (on the definition of spirits) into the body of the text (Article 1). The Commission wanted to decide on its own after consulting committees of experts (under the "comitology" procedure). The committee also looked at the issue of the regulation's legal basis. It agreed with Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee that the entire regulation should be based on Article 95 of the Treaty, on the internal market (which requires co-decision between Parliament and Council), and that the reference to Article 37 (rules on agricultural products, under which Parliament is only consulted) should be dropped. Two-year transition period Lastly, MEPs called for a two-year period to smooth the transition from the rules under the old regulation on the definition, labelling and presentation of sprits (Regulation 1576/89) to those of the new regulation.
