10 December 2001 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION with request for inclusion in the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance pursuant to Rule 50(1) of the Rules of Procedure by Charles Pasqua on behalf of the UEN Group on the continuing imprisonment of an opposition leader and the holding of democratic elections in Togo Resolution on the continuing imprisonment of an opposition leader and the holding of democratic elections in Togo The European Parliament , A. whereas the postponement of the general election due to be held on 14 and 28 October 2001- postponed, according to the authorities, for technical and financial reasons - and the imprisonment of Yawovi Agboyibo, the leader of the opposition movement 'Action Committee for Renewal', have created a mood of suspicion vis-à-vis the Togolese regime, B. whereas the undertaking given by President Eyadema to grant a presidential pardon to Yawovi Agboyibo if the latter requested it has not for the moment produced any result, C. whereas the - sometimes contradictory - statements by the Prime Minister, Agbéyomé Kodjo, the President of the Togolese National Assembly, Fambaré Natchaba, and President Eyadema on the need for a possible revision of the Constitution, with the aim of enabling the President to seek a new term of office in the 2003 elections, are undermining the confidence placed by Togolese and international public opinion in the Lomé framework agreements concluded in July 1999 and intended to bring about more peaceful relations between the regime and the opposition, D. whereas the political and economic situation in the country demands an immediate return to a climate of confidence, a climate which alone will allow Togolese society to enjoy the economic growth and democratic development to which the Lomé framework agreements were intended to contribute, E. whereas the decree setting a date of March 2002 for the forthcoming general election and the release of a budget earmarked for the organisation of the election represent a step in the right direction which can help to dispel concerns as to whether the election will in fact be held, 1. Calls on President Eyadema not to wait for Yawovi Agboyibo to request a pardon before releasing him, thereby demonstrating that the President’s faction will ensure that the Togolese opposition is able to express its views fully and freely during the forthcoming elections; 2. Welcomes the recent decrees by the President of the Togolese Republic
