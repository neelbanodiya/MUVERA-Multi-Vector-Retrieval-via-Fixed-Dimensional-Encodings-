Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2005) The Commission can only repeat to the Honourable Member that it is not its task to apportion responsibility for the factors cited by the Honourable Member. Its decision in the matter of public procurement irregularities in connection with cohesion policy programmes in Greece is now available and this may contain some of the information the Honourable Member is seeking. In addition, in response to the Honourable Member's three questions, the Commission makes the following points: Concerning the first question, the Commission's reply to Written Question E‑237/05 says that the Commission became aware, at the Community support framework (CSF) Monitoring Committee of 15 December 2004, that documentation had been made available to the members of the Monitoring Committee and the managing authorities relating to the issue of modification of contracts after signature which included a misleading presentation of the position taken by the Commission at the meeting of 10 November 2004. Concerning the second question, the Commission's reply to Written Question E‑237/05 says that, according to the Structural Funds regulation, the Greek authorities responsible for their sound financial management are the managing authorities, the paying authority and EDEL which perform their tasks under the overall responsibility of the Greek State. Concerning the third question, the Director-General of the Regional Policy DG informed the Permanent Representation of Greece to the European Union, by letter dated 22 December 2004, that the Commissioner for Regional Policy intended to propose to the Commission the suspension of interim payments of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) contribution for specific measures of these operational programmes which have been affected by irregularities. The suspension of payments has been avoided following the reply of the Greek authorities by letter of 28 February 2005, and the meetings between the Commission and Greek authorities which resulted in: • the implementation of a number of measures to ensure that the systems for the ERDF function properly to ensure the regularity of expenditure declared; • the commitment by the Greek Government to adopt new legislation to ensure compliance with Community law on public procurement and transitional provisions pending its entry into force; • the decision by the Commission on a financial correction of EUR 518 million for irregularities relating to public works contracts and studies acknowledged by the Greek authorities in respect of ERDF assistance paid for the years 2000
