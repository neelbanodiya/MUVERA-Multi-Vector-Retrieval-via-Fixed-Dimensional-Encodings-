Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (3 August 2010) After a series of informal meetings with Mercosur, the Commission agreed with Mercosur to re-launch the negotiations for an Association Agreement. The EU is currently at the start of a negotiating process after having had a meeting on the modalities of the negotiations in Buenos Aires last month. It is clear, as far as agriculture is concerned, that substantial efforts will still be needed in order to achieve an agreement that would be acceptable to the EU. On Geographical Indications it is rather early to go into detail as actual discussions have not yet taken place between parties. A broad Agreement is envisaged with Mercosur and a high protection level for Designations of Origin and Geographical Indications is an essential element to prevent their misuse. As to the specific terms the Honourable Member mentions in her question the Commission notes that ‘reserva’ and ‘gran reserva’ are traditional terms in certain EU countries. Argentina has applied on 18 February 2010 to use those terms and their application is currently being addressed in conformity with the provisions of Regulation 607/2009 Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2009 of 14 July 2009 laying down certain detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 as regards protected designations of origin and geographical indications, traditional terms, labelling and presentation of certain wine sector products.
