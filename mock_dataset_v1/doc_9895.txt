WRITTEN QUESTION E-0316/10 by Diogo Feio (PPE) to the Commission (8 February 2010) Subject: Need for a European agricultural insurance market The recent natural disasters which have seriously affected the western part of mainland Portugal (in particular the municipality of Torres Vedras) and the Autonomous Region of Madeira have further highlighted the inadequacy of current protection and compensation arrangements for farmers against the risks to which their crops and animals are exposed. They face the same lack of protection against excessive market fluctuations, which are threatening the viability of small and medium-sized holdings. Portuguese farmers' organisations recently stated that the Portuguese system was not working and was incapable of providing the country's farmers with effective assistance. In view of the above, 1. does the Commission consider the present agricultural insurance system in the Member States to be adequate? 2. does the Commission consider that the insurance cover available to Portuguese farmers to provide them with fair compensation for the damage they suffer, especially in circumstances such as those recently experienced in the western part of the country and Madeira? 3. what are the Commission's views on the complaint about the inoperativeness and ineffectiveness of Portuguese insurance schemes? 4. does the Commission not consider that a Europe-wide insurance market would provide a wider range of solutions for farmers and help improve the response to extreme situations such as those recently experienced in Portugal? 5. is the Commission prepared to promote the establishment of an effective European agricultural insurance market?
