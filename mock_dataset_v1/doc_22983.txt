Highlights, with a view to achieving competitive mobile markets, the importance of competitive and timely allocation of spectrum for wireless broadband through the Radio Spectrum Policy Programme, and calls on the Member States to make available the 800MHz band by 2013, while respecting existing services; 25. Recalls that the digital world and ICT are engines of innovation and that access to high speed broadband is therefore an essential pre-condition in all European Innovation Partnerships (EIPs), as it enhances cooperation and participation by citizens; 26. Highlights the importance of public pre-commercial procurement of R&D-based solutions for the aforementioned sectors as a means to stimulate a virtuous cycle of technological development and demand for high-speed broadband services; 27. Takes the view that the public funding earmarked for broadband services can be an effective lever to boost the competitiveness of EU regions if it is channelled into the development of up-to-date, new-generation infrastructure with a high transmission capacity in areas that have a major broadband connection deficit; believes that such areas, in particular those with a large industrial base and a high population density, could very swiftly benefit from the innovative and creative potential of new services available to individuals and businesses; 28. Considers that the extension of broadband networks, primarily in rural areas, will facilitate better communications, particularly for persons with reduced mobility or living in isolated conditions, as well as improving access to services and encouraging the development of SMEs in rural areas, thereby helping to create new jobs and develop new services in these localities; 29.
