WRITTEN QUESTION P-3337/09 by Konstantinos Droutsas (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (30 April 2009) Subject: Contempt for and commercialisation of healthcare facilities According to newspaper reports and an answer given by the Greek Government to the Hellenic Parliament, in 2003, a decision was taken to set up a city healthcare centre on the site where the 2nd Thessaloniki General Hospital Complex, ‘Ayios Pavlos’, had operated until 1999. The project, which formed part of the 3rd CSF, never materialised and the contract awarded following an invitation to tender was annulled because the work had been stopped for years as there was no provision in the tender for protection of the building against earthquakes. Nevertheless, rent for this ‘phantom’ building continues to be paid normally. The abandoned building has been stripped; all medical equipment and furnishings have disappeared. The project now appears to have been incorporated into the National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) to be put out to tender again. This ‘phantom’ healthcare centre is evidence of a contempt for healthcare facilities; when a hospital ceases to function, public money made available for healthcare is wasted, public health services are diminished and health, which is a social good, becomes a commercial commodity designed to boost the profits of private enterprises. Does the Commission know how much has been spent to date on reconstructing and equipping this ‘phantom’ building which has never been operational? Did the Community contribute towards the funding of the project and, if so, how much? What provision has been made for funding the project under the NSRF and how much is the Community's contribution?
