WRITTEN QUESTION P-0670/09 by Sérgio Marques (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (4 February 2009) Subject: Interim assessment of the situation of outermost regions no longer covered by the old economic and social cohesion policy Objective 1 As provided for in the current (2007‑13) Community support framework, Madeira, an outermost region, has ceased to be covered by what used to be Objective 1 of the economic and social cohesion policy (the present Convergence Objective). It has been granted a special phase-in arrangement under the Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objective. Madeira’s status has been determined solely according to the criterion of GDP, with no regard whatsoever to its particular structural situation, which has been expressly recognised in primary Community law (Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty). That being the case, the XIIIth Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions, held in Madeira in 2007, called on the Commission to conduct a study with a view to making an interim assessment of the development effects resulting from the fact that the outermost regions had been excluded from the scope of the former Objective 1, that is to say, the present Convergence Objective. Given the current economic crisis — which is hitting the outermost regions especially hard — it is essential to carry out such a study. 1. Has the Commission asked for the abovementioned study to be carried out? How far has the work progressed? 2. Will the findings be published in 2010, in other words halfway through the life of the Community support framework?
