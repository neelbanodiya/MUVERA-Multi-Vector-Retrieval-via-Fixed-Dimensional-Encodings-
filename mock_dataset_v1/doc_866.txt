Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (15 May 2009) The Honourable Member refers to recent press reports according to which Deutsche Telekom would block Voice over IP (VoIP) services such as Skype for use on iPhone over its network. The Honourable Member is concerned about the possible threat that such an action may pose to technological development and competition in Europe. The Commission is aware of publicly available information For instance ‘T-Mobile blockiert Billigtelefonate’ at http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/mobil/0,1518,616587,00.html. or http://www.handelsblatt.com/technologie/mobile-welt/telekom-plant-skype-blockade-fuer-iphone-und-blackberry;2219922 according to which T‑Mobile, Deutsche Telekom's subsidiary, intends to block Skype Internet telephony services over its network, allegedly because the use of Skype may damage the performance of the network (the data flows would be slowed down and the network could be overburdened) and T-Mobile would have to protect its network against this. The same limitation on use of Skype VoIP services would also apply over W‑Lan-Hotspots operated by T‑Mobile. T‑Mobile is not reported to be blocking other VoIP telephony services (such as Fring, Truphone, etc.) whose software is available for iPhone over Apple store or iTunes. Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty set out the Community antitrust rules. Whilst Article 81 of the EC Treaty prohibits all agreements and concerted practices among undertakings that restrict competition and may affect trade between the Member States, Article 82 of the EC Treaty prohibits all abusive unilateral conduct of undertakings in a dominant position that may affect trade between the Member States. Article 82 of the EC Treaty, among other things, bans market foreclosure, leveraging and other exclusionary conduct that harms competition. Since early 2008, the Commission has been monitoring the conduct of mobile network operators with respect to new Internet based services such as mobile VoIP. The Commission has contacted the parties concerned to clarify allegations of blocking that have been reported in the press. No formal antitrust proceedings under Article 11(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty, OJ L 1, 4.1.2003. and Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 773/2004 Commission Regulation (EC) No 773/2004 of 7 April 2004 relating to the conduct of proceedings by the Commission pursuant to Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty, OJ L 123, 27.4.2004. have been initiated so far. However, the inquiry is
