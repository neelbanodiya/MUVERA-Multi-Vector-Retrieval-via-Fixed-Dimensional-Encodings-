9999/C Q999 E/018 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0876/04 by Struan Stevenson (PPE-DE) to the Commission (11 March 2004) Subject: Illegal fishing in waters around the Azores The Portuguese authorities publicly revealed that 63 foreign vessels were fishing in waters around the Azores in January and February, 20 of them within the 100-mile limit. The Portuguese media have claimed that the Commission's position in this matter is that it considers these fishing activities to be legal, since they are in accordance with the opinion of the Commission's Legal Service . However, Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003 states very clearly that the old regime protecting the Azorean waters will be repealed only after 1 August 2004 or after the approval of new fishing-effort legislation. Does the Commission assume full responsibility for the present situation of uncontrolled and unrestricted fishing in water around the Azores? If this is not the case, what is the Commission intending to do?
