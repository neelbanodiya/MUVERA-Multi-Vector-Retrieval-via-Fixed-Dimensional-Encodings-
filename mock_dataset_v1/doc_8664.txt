WRITTEN QUESTION E-5177/09 by Gilles Pargneaux (S-D) to the Commission (21 October 2009) Subject: Scientific study on Red Bull The Red Bull brand has been seeking to sell its drinks in France since 1996. But the large amount of two ingredients contained in the drink, taurine and D-glucuronolactone, has proven controversial. Because of this, the French Government refused four separate requests by Red Bull to sell its product in France. But in 2007, an EU directive obliged Member States to sell products already authorised in another Member State. Red Bull seized this opportunity to force France to give in. The Ministry of Industry eventually authorised sales of the drink on 15 July 2008, to the great displeasure of the Ministry of Health which was against the move. Despite what is shown by the results of experiments on rats and the fact that some people in Europe have suffered heart attacks, no exhaustive independent scientific study has been financed to prove that Red Bull poses no threat to health. The reason consistently given for this is lack of funding. Would it not be possible for the Commission to co-finance a scientific study to identify the grave risks posed by exceeding recommended daily allowances if the product is consumed regularly?
