WRITTEN QUESTION E-3441/06 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (25 July 2006) Subject: Definition of the term ‘night’ Annex I to Directive 2002/49/EC OJ L 189, 18.7.2002, p. 12. states that ‘the night is eight hours’ and that 23.00 to 7.00 is a ‘default value’. 1. Does this mean that under this directive the term ‘night’ — as used in the context of reducing ambient noise — should be defined as a fixed, uninterrupted period from 23.00 to 7.00 local time? If not, what exactly should be understood by the definition given in Annex I to Directive 2002/49/EC? 2. At Zaventem airport, the night lasts only seven hours, from 23.00 to 6.00. Does this mean that the airport's operators are violating Directive 2002/49/EC?
