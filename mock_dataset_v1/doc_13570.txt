Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (29 April 2002) Directive 2000/13/EC Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs ( OJ L 109, 6.5.2000 ). lays down, in Article 16, the rules applicable to the language in which the labelling particulars of foodstuffs must appear. Basically, these provisions stipulate that labelling particulars must appear in a language that is easily understood by consumers, and allow the Member State in which the product concerned is marketed to stipulate that, on its territory, these labelling particulars must be provided at least in a given language from among the official languages of the Community. The obligation for labelling particulars to appear at least in German on Austrian territory therefore seems to be fully in keeping with the above-mentioned provisions, which are based on the requirement to inform and protect consumers.
