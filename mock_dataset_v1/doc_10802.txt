Global food security: more European initiatives needed Agriculture 2008-12-09 - 12:34 The EP Agriculture Committee called on Monday for “immediate and continuous action” to ensure global food security. It believes the aid of EUR 1 billion that the EU has decided to give to developing countries should be accompanied by fresh investment in agriculture and it calls for mechanisms to be set up to ensure that sufficient global food stocks are available. In the space of two years world food prices have increased by over 80% on average while cereal stocks have fallen in 2008 to a worrying historic low of 40 days’ supply, points out a report drafted by Mairead McGuinness (EPP-ED, IE), which was adopted unopposed with a few amendments by the Agriculture Committee. According to the World Bank, over 860 million people in the world are facing chronic famine and this figure could rise by 100 million as a result of the current crisis. Commodity prices have fallen back to near-2006 levels but the FAO and OECD fear they may fluctuate more, and global food demand is expected to double by 2050. Ensuring adequate global stocks Among the many measures proposed in the report, the Agriculture Committee calls for the introduction of instruments to avert dramatic and damaging price fluctuations. It argues that the EU should take the initiative by proposing a global food inventory regime, the creation of a worldwide stockholding obligation programme to ensure the availability of food and a better basic storage system for key production inputs (protein, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides) in developing countries, preferably based on private-sector players including farmers’ cooperatives. MEPs also call for a global assessment of the impact of the increase in biofuel production on commodity prices. They stress the need for international and regional agreements to ensure that energy crops do not jeopardise food security and they urge a firm commitment from the EU to give priority to second-generation biofuels which do not compete with food production. Redirecting EU development towards agriculture The Agriculture Committee regrets the reduction in the amount of development aid being devoted to agriculture, which was 17% in 1980 and only 3% in 2006, and urges the Commission to direct EU financial aid – including the European Development Fund (EDF) - towards agricultural-led growth and to do all in its power to induce governments of beneficiary countries to stick to their promise to devote 10%
