with the European Road Safety Agency, should create a system for investigating road accidents. This would on the one hand make it easier to carry out comparisons between the Member States, and on the other hand facilitate preventive work. Vehicles which have been involved in road accidents should also be investigated. Wire road-centre barriers are increasingly common, and a European standard for such barriers is desirable from a road safety perspective, taking all road users into account. Awareness of the international emergency call number 112 should be raised still further in all Member States. 5. After the 2010 objective: a vision of safety for the future The target date for the Third Road Safety Action Programme will soon be passed, and it is therefore important to ensure that the next programmes do not suffer the same fate as this one, which experienced delays both in drafting and adoption. It is now time to consider what vision the EU has for the future of road safety. It is important to launch a debate on the EU’s vision for the future of road safety now, so that the Commission can draw up its Fourth Road Safety Action Programme in good time. The aim of this vision should be to bring the risks to which our citizens are exposed in road transport down to a level comparable to risks in other areas in which the Community and the Member States have a common responsibility to take action. The opportunity offered by telematics to reduce the number of fatal accidents in the long term must be considered, and large-scale investment into research in this area is required if we are to benefit from all its advantages. The importance of mobility in general and road transport as a daily activity in particular means that the risk levels associated with road use must be reduced. Those bearing political responsibility for the road safety network must reduce the risks by making the system as 'forgiving' as possible.
