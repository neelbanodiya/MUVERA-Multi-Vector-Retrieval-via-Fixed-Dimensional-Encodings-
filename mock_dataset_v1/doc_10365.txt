Question for written answer E-002714/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) (18 March 2011) Subject: Reduction of electricity consumption The directive on the reduction of electricity consumption, which came into force in 2010, has largely been ignored, because about 30 % of the equipment used is illegal. This was confirmed by studies carried out by various universities in Europe in collaboration with the Milan Polytechnic. According to these studies, equipment that is connected to the grid and that is switched off or not being used, still consumes 11 % of all the electricity we use throughout the year at a cost of EUR 60 per family, i.e. as much as the energy produced by eight large power plants. In order to avoid excessive consumption, the directive in question stipulates that when equipment is switched off or on standby it should not exceed 1 watt of input power. The reality is quite different, since 30 % of equipment currently on sale is illegal, according to the investigation by Milan Polytechnic, which studied 6 000 products on the market as part of the Salina project to monitor energy policies. Clearly, this situation confirms that the directive is not being complied with. Can the Commission say: 1. whether it can confirm these data; 2. what tools it has to ensure that the directive achieves the objectives for which it was adopted; 3. whether there are any Member States which have not transposed the directive and, if so, which ones; 4. whether it is possible to calculate the effect achieved by its entry into force?
