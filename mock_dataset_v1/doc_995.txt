Question for written answer E-008079/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Fiorello Provera (EFD) (13 September 2011) Subject: Detention of Azeri environmental activists by Iran On 26 August, Radio Free Europe reported that Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence had detained more than 30 ethnic Azeris over environmental protests. They were demonstrating against the Iranian Government’s failure to save Lake Urmia, which is a salt lake in north-western Iran that is on the verge of drying up. According to the activists’ families, they were detained on 24 August during iftar, which is when observant Muslims break their Ramadan fast. Other activists were detained after a football match in Tabriz at which Azerbaijani fans chanted ‘Lake Urmia is dying; the Majlis orders its execution’. Ethnic Azeris began their protests after the Iranian parliament voted against allocating funds to channel water from the Araz River to raise the level of the lake. Vahid Qaradagli, who is an Azeri human rights activist in Iran, says the government has not taken steps to preserve Lake Urmia. If it dries up, then an estimated 10 million tonnes of salt will remain, causing damage to the environment and perhaps leading to illnesses in those living close by. An estimated 60 % of the lake has already evaporated. More protests were due to take place on 27 August, but the Iranian Government has clamped down in order to avert further dissent amongst ethnic Azeris. Is the High Representative/Vice-President aware of the Lake Urmia problem and the detention of Azeri activists? Is she prepared to call for the release of the thirty Azeris detained for taking part in environmental protests? Has the External Action Service made attempts to encourage the Iranian authorities to take steps to protect what remains of Lake Urmia, with a view to averting a potential environmental disaster?
