Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (29 March 2010) The Commission has been looking at the situation of foreign lecturers in Italy for a long time and has drawn the attention of the Court of Justice of the European Union to a number of cases Case 33/88 Pilar Allué and Carmel Mary Coonan v Università degli studi di Venezia [1989] ECR 1591; joined cases C‑259/91, C‑331/91 and C‑332/91 Pilar Allué and Carmel Mary Coonan and others v Università degli studi di Venezia and Università degli studi di Parma [1993] ECR I‑4309; Case C‑90/96 David Petrie and Others v Università degli studi di Verona and Camilla Bettoni [1997] ECR I‑6527; Case C‑119/04 Commission of the European Communities v Italian Republic [2006] ECR I‑6885; Case C‑276/07 Nancy Delay v Università degli studi di Firenze, Istituto nazionale della previdenza sociale (INPS) and Repubblica italiana [2008] ECR I‑3635. . It has also been in close contact with the Association of Foreign Lecturers in Italy (Associazione Lettori di Lingua Straniera in Italia — ALLSI), with which it has exchanged correspondence on the current situation of former and current lettori and CEL (collaboratori e esperti linguistici) and on the Italian legislation applicable (in particular, Italian Laws Nos 236 of 21 June 1995 and 63 of 5 March 2004 and Ministerial Decree of 8 July 2008). The Commission is also aware of the numerous judicial proceedings pending before the national courts. The information available appears to indicate that the difficulties faced by former and current lettori and CEL are due to local administrative practices that vary from one university to another. The Commission is not in a position, however, to intervene in cases where Italian legislation may have been incorrectly applied, which is a matter for the Member State concerned. Nonetheless, the Commission has asked the Italian authorities for more detailed information with a view to assessing the conformity of Italian legislation and of general administrative practice in Italy with European law applicable in the field of free movement of workers. It will consider whether any action is needed once it has examined all the information available.
