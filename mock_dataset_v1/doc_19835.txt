Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (8 February 2011) EU Structural Funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to foster the inclusion of Roma people in the European society. On 7 September 2010, the Commission decided to set up an internal Roma Task Force, in particular with the mandate of assessing the use and the effectiveness of EU funds for Roma integration by all Member States. Preliminary findings from this analysis highlight that within EU Member States, weaknesses exist in the use of EU funds and in the development of appropriate strategies to address specific problems faced by the Roma. The Roma Task Force is now identifying concrete ways to enhance the funds' use in the Member States. The results from this work will be included in an EU framework for national Roma integration strategies that the Commission intends to present in April 2011. As regards the question of possible corruption as addressed by the Honorable Member, the Commission would like to refer him to the latest Report under the Mechanism for cooperation and verification for Bulgaria and Romania. The seventh set of reports was approved by the Commission on 20 July 2010 and can be consulted at the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/secretariat_general/cvm/progress_reports_en.htm
