Question for written answer E-5914/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Liam Aylward (ALDE) (27 July 2010) Subject: EU‑Colombia Trade In early April 2010 the Colombian Public Prosecution service arrested a number of former executive officers of the DAS (Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad), including the former chief of intelligence and general secretary of the DAS and the former head of the espionage department. The Prosecution service also seized 166 pages in evidence, which set out the strategy employed by the DAS to ‘neutralise’ certain people and institutions. The provisions set out in those documents included measures aimed at causing splits, spreading disinformation, false designation as members of guerrilla organisations, criminalisation and even acts of vandalism. Is the Council still of the view that the Colombian government is a suitable partner for a free trade agreement? How does this affect the ongoing efforts to establish an EU‑Colombia Free Trade Agreement?
