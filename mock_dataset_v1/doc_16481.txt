Question for written answer E-008140/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antigoni Papadopoulou (S&D) (14 September 2011) Subject: Turkish criminal gangs and drug trafficking A recent Reuters news agency report regarding Turkish gangs involved in organised crime and drugs trafficking has caused great concern. According to a map charting the international drugs trade, 80 % of heroin reaching Western and Central Europe from Afghanistan is being channelled through Turkey. In view of this: 1. What view does the Commission take of the problem in question and what action does it intend to take against organised Turkish criminal gangs which are jeopardising the EU’s internal security? 2. Does it intend to impose strict rules regarding the protection of EU borders from Turkish criminal gangs and require full compliance therewith by Turkey itself, in view of its imminent accession?
