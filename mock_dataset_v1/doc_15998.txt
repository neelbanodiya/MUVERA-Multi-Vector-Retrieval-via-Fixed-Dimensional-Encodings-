Question for written answer E-8466/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (15 October 2010) Subject: Toxic sludge in Hungary On 4 October 2010, after the wall of a dam broke, one million cubic metres of toxic sludge, in the form of processing waste from an aluminium factory, spilled into a number of villages in the vicinity of Ajka in western Hungary. The spillage killed four people and injured 120 others, who have suffered burns and other damage caused by the high degree of chemical toxicity of the substances spilled into the streets. However, the final toll could be much worse, since seven persons are currently missing and the effects of contamination may only be evident some days after exposure. At present, the toxic sludge is covering an area of 40 square kilometres and has reached the river Marcali at various points. The government has already declared a state of emergency, but if the sludge were to reach the Raba and Danube rivers, there would be a risk of a major environmental catastrophe. What measures will the Commission take to assist the populations affected by the disaster, with a view to cleaning up the area as swiftly as possible? How will it prevent an environmental catastrophe from occurring through the possible contamination of drinking water sources and the spillage of toxic sludge into the Danube?
