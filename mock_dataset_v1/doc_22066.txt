WRITTEN QUESTION E-0684/07 by Charles Tannock (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (15 February 2007) Subject: Aid to India, Nepal and China to assist in the prevention of the international trafficking and trade of illegal endangered species skins According to a written statement from a constituent, the trade and trafficking of tiger skins protected by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), in the areas of the Indian Forests, including Kahna National Park, has not been properly monitored by the local authorities. Allegedly, little progress has been made and tigers are continuing to be killed and traded by organised criminal networks. It is also alleged that very few arrests and convictions for this illegal trade have taken place. Could the Commission clarify what financial and technical assistance is being given to India, Nepal, and China to assist them in their enforcement, both domestically and internationally, aimed at combating traffickers and traders of tiger skins? Also, to what extent has such assistance, if it has taken place, improved the situation there with regard to the international trafficking of endangered species skins?
