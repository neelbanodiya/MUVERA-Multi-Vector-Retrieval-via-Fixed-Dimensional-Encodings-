to undertake specific measures: - to submit a proposal for a formalised cooperation procedure of national stock markets (about 33 different stock exchanges exist in the EU) and the setting up of a pan-European equity listing replacing national listing requirements, thus updating the 1980 listing directive; - to draw up a communication on a European certification system for best practice in the field of investment fund management; - to submit to Parliament a 'model' of fast-track legislation, laying down principles, scope and other essential features that would keep legislation up-to-date, L. whereas the pace of market developments, due to communications technology and capital liberalisation, the work of the Basle Committee and the emergence of new market actors such as financial conglomerates, may call for changes in priorities and for new measures not foreseen in the Action Plan, 1. Welcomes the objectives and the principles of the Action Plan for financial services, as its proposals should underpin the competitive position of the EU's financial services industry, while safeguarding the interests of the consumer; notes, however, that very few of the measures foreseen are completely new, yet if taken as a whole the Action Plan could be thought of as a comprehensive overview of the state of the Union in financial services, pointing to the measures needed to reap the benefits of the euro and integrated financial markets; 2. Believes that the introduction of the euro gives a new impetus to the creation of competitive financial markets within the EU and that the stability of these markets would be enhanced if all Member States joined the EMU; 3. Agrees with the strategic objectives of the Action Plan; points out, however, that these objectives may not be attained unless the existing institutional arrangements are completely reformed; urges the Commission, accordingly, to provide a list of the administrative practices and provisions which prevent financial service providers and investors from benefiting from the opportunities offered by a single financial market; 4. Believes that the Commission should promptly table proposals for legislative harmonisation to eliminate the current legal and administrative obstacles in the various Member States to the development of integrated securities dealing systems and to the exploitation of the benefits deriving from access to certain Community-scale capital markets; subsequently, the necessary guarantees must be laid down to protect investors against the potential risks of fraud and maladministration resulting from the opening-up of financial markets; a
