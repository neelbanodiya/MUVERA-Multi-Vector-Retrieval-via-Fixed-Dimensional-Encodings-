organising the demand side and combining their efforts in counterbalancing the oligopoly on the production side; insists that this strategy should also promote best technologies for energy saving and efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources; 5. Recognises the importance of good political relations with the EU's major energy supply partner countries, particularly Norway, which remains the third largest oil producer in the world and which offers a stable energy supply and also has a proven track record of relations with Russia in the energy sector; 6. Agrees with the Council that a shared view on a strategy for security of supply should respect Member States’ geographical, economic, regional, climate and structural differences; 7. Calls on each EU Member State to draw up a prospective energy plan based on medium- and long-term forecasts of its supply and demand management, and state the means it intends to use to meet energy demand, in terms both of national production and of energy imports, stating the effects of this balance with respect to greenhouse gas emissions; 8. Stresses that an active policy in support of democratic reforms, the development of civil society and social progress in the energy-producing countries and those with transit facilities will contribute substantially to long-term political stability, which is necessary for security in the supply and distribution of energy; 9. Calls on the Commission and the Council to propose an internationally recognised mediation system for cases of conflicts and disputes concerning the delivery and distribution of energy; believes that the EU could initiate such a process by developing a mediation system as part of its neighbourhood policy and also with other key supplier countries, and could actively promote this mediation system globally; the EU should therefore develop a model approach to the international management of energy distribution; 10. Stresses the importance of including in the new energy diplomacy of the EU a constructive dialogue with all major consumers of energy and notably emerging economies on energy efficiency and energy conservation with the aim of setting minimum efficiency standards, to be harmonised on a phased basis, for global goods like cars, appliances, consumer electronics and office equipment and promoting at global level the integration of the environment into transport and energy decisions; SOLIDARITY IN THE EU 11. Stresses that an essential element of a common energy policy should be enhanced solidarity between Member States in order to deal with
