WRITTEN QUESTION E-2730/04 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (4 November 2004) Subject: Legal recognition of new professions The ASPAR (Association of Regionally Authorised Private Schools) is an Italian umbrella group bringing together 160 private educational establishments. The company ‘Ars Estetica’ is a member of this group and has for years been playing a major role in developing new professional specialisations in the field of beauty care. It also specialises in training tattooers and piercers, nail treatment technicians and shiatsu practitioners. However, the profession of tattooer and piercer is today not legally recognised: qualification to exercise it is dependent on authorisation by the Ministry of Health. The purpose of this authorisation is to establish suitable health and safety standards, given the risks associated with this activity. Nail treatment technicians and shiatsu practitioners benefit from no legal recognition whatever. Despite the imperative of increasing the professionalism and skills levels of practitioners in this field, these professions as such have not been properly defined, and nor have the appropriate training courses. Nonetheless, it is today even more important that these professions be defined so as to meet new consumer needs and market demands. Can the Commission state: 1. whether standards exist for the recognition of the professions of tattooer and piercer, nail treatment technician and shiatsu practitioner; 2. whether those professions enjoy full recognition in other EU Member States; 3. what instruments it intends to adopt to harmonise existing law pursuant to Article 47 of the EC Treaty; 4. whether it can supply an overview of the situation?
