WRITTEN QUESTION P-1576/06 by Andrzej Szejna (PSE) to the Commission (5 April 2006) Subject: Letter from the Polish Ministry of Education and Science On 9 March 2006, the Secretary of State of the Polish Ministry of Education and Science sent a letter to all education officers in Poland recommending that teaching with a pacifist, environmental or anti-war content should not be permitted in Polish schools. Is not such action by the national authorities in breach of the fundamental principles expressed in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union and, more precisely, an infringement of the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of world view? In a situation of this kind, should not the Commission take the necessary measures (e.g. under the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty on European Union) to combat this sort of behaviour in the Member States?
