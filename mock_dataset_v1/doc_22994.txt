of the EU telecoms framework and the Recommendation on NGA; 17. Notes that new fibre-optics networks offer consumers high-quality access at consistently higher speeds than existing technology; believes that it would be expedient to prioritise the development of fibre-optics-based broadband in areas where it represents the most economic and sustainable solution in the long term; asks BEREC to ensure that typical broadband speeds experienced by consumers are advertised fairly in the interests of transparency on the benefits of new technology for upload and download; calls on NRAs to take measures against providers that do not comply with BEREC recommendations; 18. Notes the importance of an ambitious, forward-looking multi-annual radio spectrum policy programme in creating high-speed broadband access across Europe, delivering on the Europe 2020 goals and ensuring that Europe is a world leader in innovation and high-tech industrial development; 19. Calls for a technology-neutral approach combining fixed, wireless, satellite and spectrum technologies; calls for effective transposition of the telecoms framework, including its net neutrality provisions, in order to ensure that the roll‑out of broadband does not restrict innovation; 20. Calls on the Commission to coordinate best practices among the Member States in the field of publicly accessible, free, high-speed WiFi networks in public transport; 21. Notes that the next generation of mobile telephone technology can also play a significant role in opening up broadband services, particularly to remote geographical areas; considers that, in the forthcoming allocation of new spectrum, governments and telecom regulators could link the release of spectrum to enhanced coverage obligations for mobile phone operators; 22. Underlines the need for sustained research investment within the EU in both fixed and mobile future communication technologies; calls on the Commission to continue to develop joint technology initiatives in these areas, involving universities, research institutes, device manufacturers and service and content providers; considers that these platforms provide the optimum means of developing and exploiting new technology and will give the EU a significant competitive advantage.
