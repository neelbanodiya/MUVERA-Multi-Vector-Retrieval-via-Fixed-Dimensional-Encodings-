difficulties and problems in this domain encountered by citizens including those which prevent or affect adversely their rights within a common judicial area and indicate possible solutions to these problems. The study highlighted the following policy objectives: — maintain and further develop an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons, and of services, is ensured; — support citizens in asserting their rights at Union level, especially the right to respect for their private and family life, their right to marry and to found a family, their right to a name and their right to an identity and to the proof thereof; — promote protection of citizens' rights, reduce obstacles to the free movement of persons and services, and avoid forgery, identity fraud and theft. The Study will serve as a basis for the Commission's future work in this area starting by the publication of a Green Paper on improving the cross-border circulation and recognition of documents. The Green Paper will launch a broad public consultation during the second half of 2010.
