WRITTEN QUESTION P-0071/05 by Anneli Jäätteenmäki (ALDE) to the Commission (11 January 2005) Subject: Framework directive to prevent natural disasters and major accidents The Commission has drawn up an EU-wide strategy to prevent natural disasters and technological risks and coordinate joint action. In its earlier consultations it indicated that it would, among other things, adopt a communication and a framework directive to deal with these matters. Indeed, on 25 March 2004 it adopted a communication entitled ‘Reinforcing the Civil Protection Capacity of the European Union’ (IP/04/385). In the light of the natural disaster that struck South-East Asia over Christmas 2004, which was huge in both its scale and effects and has created an urgent need to increase the efficiency of, and coordinate, action, not least among the EU Member States, can the Commission say: 1. When it will adopt the projected framework directive to prevent natural disasters and technological risks? 2. If it no longer plans to adopt the directive, what other measures it will propose to enable joint action by Member States and communication between them in crisis situations to be speeded up and made more effective?
