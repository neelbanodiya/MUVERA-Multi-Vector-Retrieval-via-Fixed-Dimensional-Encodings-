Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (1 March 2012) 1. As long as Italy complies with Article 132(1) (a) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (transposed into Italian law as Article 10(16) of D.P.R 633/72), which sets out that ‘Member States shall exempt the following transactions: (a) the supply by the public postal services of services other than passenger transport and telecommunications services, and the supply of goods incidental thereto’, the Commission does not consider the VAT exemption of the products falling within the universal postal service to constitute a state aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU. Indeed, Article 132(1)(a) of the 2006/112/EC Directive does not allow any margin of discretion to the State as regards the exemption of public postal services from VAT. Therefore that exemption is not imputable to the action of the Member State See to that effect Case T-351/02, Deutsche Bahn v Commission , [2006] ECR II‑1047, paragraphs 99-104. . 2. As clarified by the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C‑357/07 TNT UK, point 49, ‘the exemption provided for in Article 13A(1)(a) of the Sixth Directive 77/388 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes applies to the supply by the public postal services acting as such — that is, in their capacity as an operator who undertakes to provide all or part of the universal postal service in a Member State — of services other than passenger transport and telecommunications services, and the supply of goods incidental thereto. It does not apply to supplies of services or of goods incidental thereto for which the terms have been individually negotiated’.
