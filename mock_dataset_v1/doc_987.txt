Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (20 July 2011) The EU has closely followed the Syrian authorities' increasingly violent crackdown, including by military means, against peaceful protestors in many cities and villages across the country. High Representative/Vice-President condemned these repressions in her statements repeatedly, calling for an immediate end of violence, respect for citizens' right to peaceful protests, and the release of political prisoners and human rights defenders without delay. The EU Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June 2011 reiterated its urgent calls on the Syrian regime to put an immediate end to violence, grant access to international monitors, humanitarian agencies, media and a mission of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. In the light of the continued violence, the EU has expanded on 24 June 2011 its sanctions to include more Syrian individual responsible for or associated with the violence, a well as a number of entities financing the repression. The EU is also concerned about the humanitarian impact of the crisis in Syria with thousands of civilians and families internally displaced or seeking refuge in neighbouring countries. The EU has called for allowing humanitarian access to the areas afflicted by repressions, in order for humanitarian organisations, in particular the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Red Crescent to provide swift and substantial humanitarian assistance to local inhabitants, including by means of medicines and equipment necessary for the provision of first aid and medical treatment. The President of ICRC held discussions with the Syrian Government on 19 and 20 June 2011, expressing willingness to consider the request for access. Commission's humanitarian experts conducted field assessments in Turkey and Lebanon which confirmed that the Syrian refugees have received immediate and adequate assistance by local authorities and communities with the support of international humanitarian organisations. Throughout the Commission has remained in close contact with international humanitarian organisations to coordinate emergency planning and support and stands ready to provide any assistance and support as deemed appropriate.
