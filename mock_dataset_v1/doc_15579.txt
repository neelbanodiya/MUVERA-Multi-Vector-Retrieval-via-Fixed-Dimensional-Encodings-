WRITTEN QUESTION E-6082/08 by Marian Harkin (ALDE) to the Commission (11 November 2008) Subject: Planning: enurement clauses Does the inclusion of an enurement clause in the Planning Regulation of Galway County Council in the Republic of Ireland constitute discrimination? These clauses contain a condition that limits the occupancy or the transfer of a dwelling to another owner unless specific conditions are satisfied, for example length of occupancy. The purpose of an enurement clause is to enable the planning authority to grant permission for residential development in controlled areas to meet the specifics of a particular applicant. Would the Commission agree that the discriminatory process of enurement clauses demonstrated by Galway County Council is in breach of the right to property as outlined in Chapter 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and of other relevant EU legal measures? If so, what practical EU legal measures can citizens rely on to enable them to enjoy the full benefit of their property rights?
