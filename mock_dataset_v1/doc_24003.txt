Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (11 March 2011) To guarantee the highest possible level of public health, all medicinal products for human use intended to be placed on the EU market must be authorised in accordance with the EU pharmaceutical legislation Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004, and Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001. , either at the Member States' or at EU level. The scientific evaluation of the application is carried out by the European Medicines Agency or a competent national authority. On the grounds of this scientific assessment, the Commission or competent national authority may grant a marketing authorisation to the applicant. The marketing authorisation holder is then obliged to record and report to the competent authorities, any suspected adverse reactions. This allows the continuous update of the marketing authorisation to reflect any new information. Furthermore, the new pharmacovigilance legislation, adopted in December 2010 Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010, OJ L 348, 31.12.2010 p. 1, and Directive 2010/84/EU, OJ L 348, 31.12.2010. , further strengthens the EU system for the post-authorisation surveillance of medicines. It introduces additional provisions to ensure detection of safety issues for products on the market, and for these concerns to be addressed in a timely and harmonised manner across the EU. The Commission considers that this new legal framework provides the competent authorities with the necessary tools to address safety issues that emerge after medicinal products have been authorised.
