22 November 1973 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to methods of testing the biodegradability of anionic surfactants OJ L 347, 17.12.1973, p. 53. Directive as amended by Directive 82/243/EEC (OJ L 109, 22.4.1982, p. 18). , 82/242/EEC of 31 March 1982 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to methods of testing the biodegradability of non-ionic surfactants OJ L 109, 22.4.1982, p. 1. , 82/243/EEC of 31 March 1982 amending Directive 73/405/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to methods of testing the biodegradability of anionic surfactants OJ L 109, 22.4.1982, p. 18. and 86/94/EEC of 10 March 1986 amending for the second time Directive 73/404/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to detergents OJ L 80, 25.3.1986, p. 51. , have been significantly amended on several occasions.

In accordance with the principle of propotionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective. A Regulation is the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes directly on manufacturers precise requirements to be implemented at the same time and in the same manner throughout the Community; in the area of technical legislation, uniformity of application in the Member States is needed, and this can only be guaranteed by a Regulation. 3) a new definition for detergents is needed to cover equivalent uses and be in line with developments at Member State level. (4) It is necessary to introduce a surfactant definition, which was lacking in the existing legislation. (5) It is important to give a clear and precise description of the
