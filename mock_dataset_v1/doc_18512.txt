Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2012) The current legislation on medical devices is based on the so-called ‘New Approach’ or ‘New Legislative Framework’. According to this, the legislator only sets up generic, so-called Essential Requirements which are to be concretised by European standards. Among these requirements is the need to ensure that where devices are intended for use in combination with other devices or equipment, the whole combination, including the connecting system is safe and does not impair the specified performances of the devices. As already stated in the response to Written Question E‑011104/2010 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , the Commission has invited the European standardisation organisation CEN to verify that the issue of connectivity has been appropriately and completely addressed in existing standards. Taking into account the importance of this issue on patient's quality of life, the European Commission will carefully monitor future developments.
