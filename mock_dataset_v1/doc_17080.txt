9999/C Q999 E/046 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0698/04 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE) to the Commission (25 February 2004) Subject: Tinned food and olive oil The Community's Mediterranean countries are the world's largest olive oil producers. This sensitive product, one of the Mediterranean area's major agricultural crops, is used for a considerable range of preserved, semi-preserved and prepared fish and seafood, either as the liquid in which these products are preserved, or as an ingredient, since it has significant nutritional qualities, and on foreign markets, has become a synonym for quality and healthy eating. The production costs faced by Community businesses are much higher than those of their third country competitors. If the elimination of reimbursements for the production of olive oil for preserving purposes persists, will the EU reduce or suspend custom duties on imported olive oil, so that Community businesses can continue to compete with their third country counterparts on an equal footing?
