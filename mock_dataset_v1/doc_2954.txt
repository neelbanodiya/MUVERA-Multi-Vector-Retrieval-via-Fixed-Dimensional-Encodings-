WRITTEN QUESTION E-4028/05 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (3 November 2005) Subject: Proposal to designate Istanbul European Capital of Culture in 2010 According to the bulletin of the Commission's Education and Culture DG, Istanbul has submitted a proposal to be designated European Capital of Culture in 2010. However, according to Decision 1419/1999/EC OJ L 166, 1.7.1999, p. 1 . , Germany and Hungary are the countries entitled to nominate a city for that year. This makes little sense, since it is unlikely that Istanbul will be designated unless one of the countries in question withdraws. Will the Commissionl say therefore what it intends to do in this matter? Would it not be more reasonable for Istanbul to wait for the conclusion of the present round of countries entitled to nominate a city which comes to an end with Italy in 2019?
