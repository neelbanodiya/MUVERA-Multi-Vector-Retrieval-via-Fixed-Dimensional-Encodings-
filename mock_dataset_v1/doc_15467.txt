WRITTEN QUESTION E-1939/04 by Bill Newton Dunn (ALDE) to the Commission (9 September 2004) Subject: Timeshares Fraud perpetrated in the timeshare market causes not only much misery to those involved, but also the unexpected loss of substantial amounts of money. In particular, there are a number of fraudulent practices which involve the promise of cash back after signing up to a timeshare. This cash is often never seen, and people are left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Given that the European Parliament called for a revision of the Timeshares Directive (Directive 94/47/EEC OJ L 280, 29.10.1994, p. 83 . ) in July 2002 (P5_TA(2002)0368 - 2000/2208 (INI) OJ C 271 E, 12.11.2003, p. 578 . ) and that serious problems continue to exist in this area, can the Commission confirm that it will be proposing revised legislation? If so, will it indicate when it will do so? How will the Commission ensure that current legislative loopholes are closed and that illegal and dishonest practices in this market cease at the earliest possible date?
