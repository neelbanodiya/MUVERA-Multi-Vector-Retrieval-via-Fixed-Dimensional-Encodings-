the FAO Code of Conduct for responsible fishing and the United Nations Agreement on the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks refer to the adoption of the precautionary principle in order to guarantee the conservation and management of marine resources and the marine environment, and whereas, in particular, Annex II of the UN Agreement provides a comprehensive, operational definition of the precautionary approach to fisheries management, C. whereas the situation with regard to fishery resources is characterised by the fact that many commercial species are over-exploited and indeed face the risk of biological collapse, and whereas the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries has itself noted that the vast majority of stocks do not conform to its definition of a precautionary approach, D. whereas, in order to secure more accurate scientific assessments of the state of fisheries resources and with a view to removing any uncertainties more successfully, scientific experts from the countries and communities affected and representatives from the fisheries sector should be involved in the studies and research projects, E. whereas the over-fished species and the sectors of the fishing fleet which are engaged in catching those species must be identified clearly (and, in the case of the species, with scientific accuracy), F. noting that fishing gears and practices as used at present lead to large quantities of quota species being discarded, G. having regard to the emergency decisions which have had to be taken this year concerning cod in the North Sea and Scotland area and the northern hake stock, which demonstrate the failure of the measures for the rational management of fishery resources currently in force in the European Union, H. whereas all the factors which affect the volume of fisheries resources and the sustainability thereof (in particular pollution, transport by sea and illegal fishing) must be evaluated, I. having regard to the sweeping criticism voiced by the industry with regard to the system of total allowable catches (TACs) by the EU Council of Ministers each December, including its frequent practice of setting TACs at levels in excess of those recommended by the scientific advisory bodies, J. whereas the application of the precautionary principle in setting TACs is a necessary measure to ensure the continuity of species and the rational exploitation of resources in the long term, 1.
