2004/C 33 E/217 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2098/03 by Sebastiano Musumeci (UEN) to the Commission (25 June 2003) Subject: SARS emergency: preventive measures SARS, or atypical pneumonia, a disease whose origins have not yet been established and for which thee is so far no cure, has become the new plague of the third millennium, thanks to the ease with which it spreads. By reason of its contagiousness it is affecting dozens of new victims every day, mostly in China and South-East Asia. Effective preventive measures against the spread of SARS must meet a number of minimum joint criteria in all countries, and even more so in the EU Member States, given the urgent need to implement preventive measures to combat this disease. 1. Can the Commission state whether it believes it is necessary to promote and cofinance a large-scale, Europe-wide information campaign (e.g. on the lines followed in Singapore and Taiwan) with a view to establishing how SARS is transmitted and determining the precautions needed to prevent contagion? 2. Does the Commission consider it necessary to propose introducing checks (e.g. temperature controls) at all the EU's external borders, in view of the speed and apparent ease of transmission of SARS and the circumstances of its presence in a number of third countries?
