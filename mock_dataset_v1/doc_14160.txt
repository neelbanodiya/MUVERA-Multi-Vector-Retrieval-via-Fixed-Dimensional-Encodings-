a whole; calls on the EU Member States to individualise social security rights including pension rights; 9. Calls on the Member States to properly design a minimum income scheme and to review their pension systems in terms of the societal gender roles, taking into account the higher life expectancy of women without by any means using it as a justification for sex-based discrimination, and the major pay differentials between men and women, which are reflected in the amount of the pensions granted, often pushing them below the poverty line, and to eliminate the gender pension gap; 10. Due to the fact, that differences between the pensions of women and men are consequences of the gender pay gap, asks the Commission to take decisive steps to close this gap; 11. Calls on the Member States to find ways to prevent female employment on the labour market being adversely affected by measures to support, evaluate or enhance the value of work in the home; calls, therefore, for the impact on society and female employment of measures to recognise work done in the home to be assessed, including by means of a costed calculation for pension purposes; 12. Stresses the need to develop a European employment strategy that encourages more women to participate in the labour market and that combats inequality in employment that has a gendered impact on the level of pension contributions and entitlements; 13. Calls on the Commission to initiate the procedure aimed at eliminating Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/113/EC which allows for discriminations against women on pension products; 14. Calls on the Commission to promote a European framework directive on minimum pensions which could define that every person from a certain age on, independent of the years he or she has worked is entitled to a minimum pension; 15. Urges the Commission and the Member States to obligate occupational and other supplementary pension providers to use gender-neutral mortality tables when calculating pension benefits so as to prevent women from being punished for their higher life expectancy with lower replacement rates than men; 16.
