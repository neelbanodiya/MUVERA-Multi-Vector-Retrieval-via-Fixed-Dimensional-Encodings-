information on control and monitoring, details should be provided for any precautions taken in terms of distance(s) from sexually compatible plant species, both wild relatives and crops as well as any measures to minimise/prevent dispersal of any reproductive organ of the genetically modified higher plants (e.g. pollen, seeds, tuber). Against the background of the risk assessment, GMOs are only authorised for the placing on the market when there is no reason to believe that there is an adverse effect on human health or the environment under the conditions of consent. In the case of seed crops, minimum distances from undesirable neighbouring pollen sources have been established in the seed legislation in the case of cross-pollinated plants. These distances vary according to the species, the kind of variety and of the category of seeds. The Scientific Committee on Plants has stated in its opinion of 7 March 2001 on the adventitious presence of GM seeds in conventional seeds http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/scp/out93_gmo_en.pdf. , that one of the measures to achieve a 0,3 % threshold for adventitious GM presence in the case of non GM hybrids of oilseed rape would be to increase the current isolation distance up to 3000 meters.
