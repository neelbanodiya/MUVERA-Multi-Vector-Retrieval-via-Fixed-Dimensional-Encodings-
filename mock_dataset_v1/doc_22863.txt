Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2011) The Biolamp to which the Honourable Member refers is an interesting concept that still has to be developed, tested and demonstrated before it could be commercialised. Therefore it is the Commission's opinion that it is not yet ready for deployment. The Commission supports research, development and demonstration in the field of biofuel production from algae through its seventh framework programme. A topic on algae biofuels was published last year by the Directorate-General for Energy. Under the 2009 call, the Commission financed a coordination action to network the major European actors, the project AquaFUELs http://www.aquafuels.eu/ . One of the main outcomes has been the creation of the European Algae Biomass Association http://www.eaba-association.eu/ . The 2010 FP7 energy call had a dedicated topic for large-scale demonstration projects with a minimum plantation surface area of 10 ha and minimum productivity of 90 ton dry matter per hectare per year. In the framework of this call topic the Commission is at present negotiating three contracts for a total Commission support of EUR 21 million ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/docs/wp/cooperation/energy/e_wp_201001_en.pdf .
