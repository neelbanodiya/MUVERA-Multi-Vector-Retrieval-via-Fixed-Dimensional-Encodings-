WRITTEN QUESTION E-4882/06 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) , Salvatore Tatarella (UEN) , Romano La Russa (UEN) , Sergio Berlato (UEN) and Alessandro Foglietta (UEN) to the Commission (15 November 2006) Subject: Possible derogation for pigs slaughtered in Sardinia Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 OJ L 338, 22.12.2005, p. 60. stipulates that slaughtered pigs must be subjected to trichinoscopic examination to check for the presence of trichinella larvae, which can cause death in man. In the Region of Sardinia there is a tradition of eating ‘suckling pig’, which is slaughtered when only 30-40 days old. As a number of studies by the Italian Higher Institute of Health confirm, it is scientifically impossible for pigs of this age to become infested with trichinella larvae, and cooking, even at a temperature of 65°C, destroys all such larvae. A derogation from the regulation in question, aimed at exempting pigs slaughtered between 30 and 40 days after birth from trichinoscopic testing would constitute a considerable saving for the Region of Sardinia, since it is estimated that in Sardinia alone about 200000 pigs are slaughtered each year. In view of all this, can the Commission say: 1. whether it is aware of the new studies carried out on trichinella larvae; 2. whether it considers a derogation from Regulation (EC) No 2075/2005 desirable so as not to adversely affect pork production in Sardinia; 3. what the situation is in the other EU Member States?
