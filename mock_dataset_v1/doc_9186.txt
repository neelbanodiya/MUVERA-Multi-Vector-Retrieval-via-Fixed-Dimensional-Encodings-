Question for written answer E-001677/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (1 March 2011) Subject: Freedom of movement of audiovisual products between Spain's Autonomous Communities For historical, linguistic and cultural reasons, it was a cultural organisation called Acció Cultural del País Valencià (ACPV) that took the lead in building booster stations for the Catalan television channel (TV3) on the territory of the Valencian Community in the 1980s, since Spanish Law 46/1983 did not permit the establishment of supra-autonomous-regional audiovisual entities. Since January 2007, the Valencian Generalitat has been trying to close these booster stations, and since ACPV refused to comply with this demand, the Generalitat has used the courts to close down three of the existing main booster stations. ACPV is now involved in legal proceedings because of its refusal to close the boosters still operating, and the courts have imposed two fines of EUR 600 000, which have to be paid by 20 March this year http://www.levante-emv.com/television/2011/02/11/consell-acentua-presion-acpv-exigir-600000-euros-20-marzo/781628.html . Furthermore, the Generalitat's Ministry of Finance's DG for Taxation has rejected all the appeals lodged by ACPV against these fines. Given the refusal of the Valencian Generalitat to reach an agreement with the Generalitat de Cataluña on guaranteeing reciprocal broadcasting rights for their respective autonomous-regional channels, and that such behaviour on the part of the Valencian Generalitat means that both it and the Spanish State are failing to comply with Directive 2007/65/EC on the freedom of movement of audiovisual products and and with the need to adopt measures to prevent political and administrative frontiers constituting an obstacle to the promotion of European linguistic diversity, and given that they are moreover infringing both Articles 3.3, 20.3, 149.2 and 149.1.21 of the Spanish Constitution and the European Charter of Regional or Minority Languages, 1. Does the Commission think that the behaviour of the Valencian Generalitat and the inaction of the Spanish Government infringe Directive 2007/65/EC on the protection of the freedom of movement of cultural products? In the light of the directive, should the remaining booster stations remain operational? 2. Does the Commission think that it would be appropriate for the Spanish Parliament to adopt an amendment of Law 46/1983 which would permit supra-autonomous-regional broadcasting? 3. Does the Commission think that it would be appropriate for the Spanish Parliament to support the popular legislative initiative ‘Televisión sin fronteras’, which has secured the support of 650 000 people?
