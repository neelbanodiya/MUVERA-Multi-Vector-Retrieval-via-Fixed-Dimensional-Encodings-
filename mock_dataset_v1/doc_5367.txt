Decision 2000/68/EC when providing certain derogations for the use of medicinal products in food-producing animals in order to improve the availability of veterinary medicinal products for treatment of equidae. However, the Commission, aware of the problems encountered by certain Member States, in particular those that in 1999 were most strongly demanding these identification rules, included in its draft Regulation establishing the method of identification of equidae and repealing Commission Decisions 93/623/EEC and 2000/68/EC a specific derogation for equidae kept under feral or semi-feral conditions. Following exhaustive discussions of this draft with the affected industry, it is at present being discussed with the Member States and a copy of the document is sent direct to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat.
