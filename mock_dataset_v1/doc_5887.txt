Question for written answer E-001022/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (9 February 2011) Subject: Dairy sector: the Canadian contractual model While the contractual system is extremely fashionable, and is presented to us — by the high-level expert group on the milk crisis, among others — as the solution to the troubles in the dairy sector, the evidence is undeniable: it is far from universally loved by milk producers, who remain largely sceptical as to its merits. Indeed, in Switzerland for example, the contractual system has not exactly been a success. Being a natural-born optimist, however, I have managed to find a contractual model that works: the system in Canada offers an attractive price to producers (almost EUR 0.60 per litre) and consumers make it a point of honour to buy Canadian products. This is example that ought to be studied in greater detail, but it has come to my attention that, in negotiations towards a bilateral agreement with Canada, the EU has reportedly asked Canada to give up its contractual system, which it deems to be overly protectionist. Can the Commission explain why, instead of demanding that Canada scrap a dairies policy that has worked well for almost 40 years — unlike our which, with its excessive deregulation has recently forced thousands of farms in the 27 Member States into bankruptcy — it does not follow the Canadian example as a means of offering our dairy producers an immediate future and securing the sector’s long-term prospects?
