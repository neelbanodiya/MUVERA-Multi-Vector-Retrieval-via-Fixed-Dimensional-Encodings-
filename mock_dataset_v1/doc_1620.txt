Question for written answer E-002055/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Silvia-Adriana Ţicău (S&D) (7 March 2011) Subject: Access for Romanian SMEs to EIB credits for the sector For the period 2008-09, the EIB allocated a total of EUR 15 billion to credits for SMEs, as part of a global package of EUR 30 billion for 2008‑11. These credits will be assigned with the assistance of intermediaries such as commercial banks, and concern tangible or intangible investments by SMEs. EIB credits also help ensure a stable basis of working capital for SMEs, which may therefore be eligible for EIB financing and credits for financing liabilities related to the commercial cycle for SMEs, reflecting their long-term funding needs. The credits may have a duration of between 2 and 12 years and a maximum value of EUR 12.5 million per loan. Can the Commission specify what EU funding has been granted to Romania under this programme, and what the absorption level is on the part of Romanian SMEs?
