WRITTEN QUESTION P-1108/07 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (28 February 2007) Subject: Technical inspection of vehicles In his answer to my Question E‑4658/06, Commissioner Barrot states that European legislation does not prohibit the technical inspection of a vehicle in a Member State other than the one in which the vehicle has been registered. Moreover, he adds that the Member States often use technical inspection to verify other details concerning the vehicle, such as the validity of the registration, the insurance certificate, and the payment of road tax, etc. It is generally agreed that the aim of vehicle technical inspection is to provide reliable certification that the vehicle is safe and not that the road tax, for example, has been paid, which is the responsibility of the tax authorities. Is a technical inspection carried out at a public (or officially State authorised) vehicle inspection centre, e.g. in Greece, Germany or other Member States, invalid in respect of a vehicle which has been registered, for example, in Belgium or in another Member State of the Union?
