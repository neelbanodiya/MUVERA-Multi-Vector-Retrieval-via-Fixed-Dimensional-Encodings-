and justice (AFSJ), in which it notes that even where significant progress has been made in creating certain parts of the AFSJ, some of this has happened without complying with the deadlines set in Tampere, while other objectives already defined have not yet been achieved. MEPs call for all the delayed measures to be adopted by the end of 2004, including the provision for a common asylum policy and common arrangements for entry and residence for working, studying and training. Looking further ahead, Parliament calls for the definition by the beginning of 2005 of a new agenda (Tampere II) in response to the EU's continuing needs in this area for the medium term (2005-2009). Parliament argues that the development of the AFSJ requires the adoption of the draft Constitutional Treaty, including the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. MEPs also reject the initiative of the six countries (Austria, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK) who wrote to the Commission calling for a reduction in the Community budget for the next financial period between 2007 and 2013, as this would prevent the Commission from performing its tasks regarding the AFSJ. Among the specific points in the resolution, MEPs: deplore the fact that the Commission has allowed the personal data of European citizens travelling to the United States to be forwarded to US security agencies without adequate guarantees of confidentiality; call for a ban on collective expulsions; the strengthening of police cooperation and the replacement of the Europol convention with a normal piece of EU legislation in the field; the establishment of an International Day of the Victims of Terrorism. In view of the attacks in Madrid, MEPs suggest today's date 11 March, for this day.
