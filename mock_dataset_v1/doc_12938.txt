Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (24 March 2009) The Commission is closely following the situation in the areas of democratic governance, human rights and fundamental freedoms and which are raised in our contacts with the Azerbaijani authorities, at all levels. In this context the Commission is continuously stressing the need to pursue the ‘European shared values’ which Azerbaijan has subscribed to when accepting to be part of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This was done most recently at the Political Security Committee Troika meeting with Azerbaijan on 12 February 2009 and at the Cooperation Council on 9 December 2008 in Brussels. The issues of human rights and fundamental freedoms were also discussed during the visit of the Member of the Commissioner in charge of External Relations to Azerbaijan on 21 January 2009 both with the Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Foreign Minister Mammadyarov. The case of Mrs Leyla Yunus was raised during the Member of the Commissioner in charge of External Relations' meeting with President Aliyev. About one third of Community overall assistance over the period 2007-10 is devoted to supporting good governance, human rights, political and institutional reforms in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan has also benefited an allocation of EUR 1.8 millions from the European Instrument of Democracy and Human Rights in 2007-08.
