Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (31 January 2011) The Commission is aware of the existence of mandatory memberships and payments to local cable TV associations in Denmark, and has raised its concerns in the last two (14th and 15th See also link: http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/library/communications_reports/annualreports/15th/index_en.htm ) Progress Reports on the Single European Electronic Communications Market. The Commission welcomes the recommendation set out in the report by the Danish Ministerial High Speed Broadband Committee in January 2010 to abolish these compulsory memberships in local cable TV associations. The Commission is always very vigilant as regards the need both for Member States and for market players to respect EU rules on competition. In particular, pursuant to Article 106 TFEU, in the case of undertakings to which Member States grant special or exclusive rights, Member States shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in the Treaties. Pursuant to Directive 2002/77/EC on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2002:249:0021:0021:EN:PDF , Member States shall not grant or maintain in force exclusive or special rights for the establishment and/or the provision of electronic communications networks, or for the provision of publicly available electronic communications services. The Commission encourages a speedy adoption of the necessary legislation in Denmark to remove compulsory membership of local cable TV associations in Denmark so that market entry or the deployment of broadband networks (fibre and other new technologies) may not be hindered. It will in particular monitor that the legislation in question is actually approved and implemented. Should this not be the case, it will have to investigate whether or not there exist exclusive or special rights and whether any such exclusive or special rights are in line with EC law.
