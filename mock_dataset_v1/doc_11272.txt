WRITTEN QUESTION E-4179/07 by Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (20 August 2007) Subject: Advent of the iPhone on the Community internal market Part of the iPhone concept in the United States is that Apple concludes an agreement with one network operator only. The consumer has no possibility of influencing the choice of operator. Under the European telecommunications market legislation, consumers have a guaranteed right to change their telephone operator if they so wish. Does the Commission believe the iPhone concept to be compatible with Community legislation?
