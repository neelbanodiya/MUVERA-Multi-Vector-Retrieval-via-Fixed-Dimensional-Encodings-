WRITTEN QUESTION E-1525/07 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 March 2007) Subject: Animal welfare provisions in trade agreements The ‘communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on animal welfare legislation on farmed animals in third countries and the implications for the EU’, issued in November 2002, expressed the Commission’s aim ‘at including animal welfare as an issue’ in future bilateral or multilateral agreements. Up until that point, only the EU‑Chile agreement contained specific animal welfare provisions regarding stunning and slaughter. Since then, negotiations for free trade agreements have been constantly ongoing with several countries and groups of countries. Can the Commission provide an update on what has been achieved so far in relation to the inclusion of specific animal welfare provisions in the bilateral or multilateral agreements by the EU?
