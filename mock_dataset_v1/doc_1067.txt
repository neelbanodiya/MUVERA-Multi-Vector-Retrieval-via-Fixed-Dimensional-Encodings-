Question for written answer E-002277/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Tomasz Piotr Poręba (ECR) (10 March 2011) Subject: Underground coal gasification The process of obtaining syngas from coal has been around for many years. It fell out of favour in the mid‑20th century as a result of the low prices of crude oil and natural gas. Nowadays, however, with estimates that oil and gas reserves will run out over the next few decades, and prices shooting up at a rate that is impossible to predict, we need to look at solutions that have been used successfully in the past with a view to improving, updating and implementing them. It is estimated that Poland’s coal reserves run into tens of millions of tonnes. For many years coal has been the basis for around 90 % of Poland’s energy production. In line with the EU’s policy to cut CO 2 emissions, Poland is being forced to find other ways to generate power, but this cannot be allowed to result in an excessive increase in costs for energy consumers, and nor should one environmentally damaging method be replaced by another that is equally damaging, as well as risky and controversial. With this in mind I should like to put the following questions to the Commission: 1. Are any companies in the European Union already successfully carrying out coal gasification underground using wells drilled from the surface? 2. How does the Commission assess the prospects for developing this method of obtaining syngas? 3. Are there any underground CO 2 storage facilities in the EU?
