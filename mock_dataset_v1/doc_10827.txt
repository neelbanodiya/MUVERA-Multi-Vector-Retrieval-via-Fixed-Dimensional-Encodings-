Question for written answer E-6148/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) and Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (29 July 2010) Subject: Proposal to create a mechanism to facilitate young entrepreneurs' access to the credit market In its recent answer (H‑0312/2010) the Council states that it has not received either a proposal or a recommendation from the Commission proposing to give young people preferential access to funding to set up businesses. Given that unemployment among young people in Europe is more than 21 % and the ‘Europe 2020 Strategy’ enshrines as a basic priority support for entrepreneurship, innovative ideas and employment, but also considering that programmes such as ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’ have a positive impact but are not able fully to meet the objective needs of a young person who would like to put his or her idea into practice in business, can the Commission adopt specific initiatives to create support mechanisms for new and innovative business proposals, which would either facilitate young people’s access to the credit market or guarantee loans to them under particularly favourable conditions?
