extensively liberalised road, air and waterway transport. The missed opportunities of the past and the future challenges to the transport sector as a whole mean that the special attention will have to be paid by Europe's legislators to revitalising and further developing the rail sector. There is a need for regulation and investment at European and Member-State level alike. It was to that end that in autumn 1998 the Commission proposed its first railway package (the so-called 'infrastructure package'), on which the Council and Parliament succeeded, after prolonged negotiations, in reaching agreement early in 2001 Directives 2001/12, 2001/13 and 2001/14, 26. February 2001. . At the heart of the package is the progressive opening up of the market for international freight transport on the European rail network by way of an amendment to railways directive 91/440/EEC. Amending Directive 2001/12/EG OJ. L 75, 15.3.2001, p. 1. provides, with effect from 15 March 2003, for the partial opening up of European freight transport on the Trans European Rail Freight Network (TERFN) introduced by the directive pursuant to Article 10a, and culminating, from 15 March 2008, with the complete opening up of the entire network to cross-border transport. Attention should, moreover, be drawn to the important fact that Commission Vice-President Loyola de Palacio, on the occasion of the agreement on the infrastructure package, agreed that proposals would shortly be submitted on cabotage in rail freight transport and passenger transport: [W]e plan to draw up a communication on opening up national freight transport and international passenger transport to the market, as I stated when both of these directives were being processed. The communication should even be ready before the end of the year.
