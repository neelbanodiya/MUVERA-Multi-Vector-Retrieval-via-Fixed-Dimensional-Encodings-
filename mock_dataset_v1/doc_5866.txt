Question for written answer E-011082/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (29 November 2011) Subject: Harbour charges Can the Commission comment on whether Galway County Council has been authorised to impose new charges on those using the harbours on Inis Mór? Apart from the airport, islanders do not have any other means of accessing the mainland, the only place where basic public services are available to them. Does the Commission agree that Galway County Council is discriminating against these islanders because, unlike their counterparts on the mainland, they are being penalised financially for using these services, simply because they live on an island?
