ORAL QUESTION H-0926/06 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Diamanto Manolakou to the Council Subject: Missing people in Cyprus used as human guinea-pigs by the Turks A report by an American firm conducting strategic analyses and studies states that Greek Cypriots and Greek soldiers who have been missing since the invasion of Northern Cyprus by Turkish troops in 1974 were used as human guinea-pigs in industrial laboratories run by the Turkish armed forces between 1984 and 1988. Given that the tragedy for the families of those missing has now lasted for more than three decades and Turkey, which continues to occupy the northern part of Cyprus, has never provided any information on those missing, will the Council take the necessary initiatives to demand that Turkey provide all the information in its possession on these missing people, however distressing that information might be, so that this tragedy can be brought to an end?
