Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 December 2005) The European Union has, through its transport policy, made great strides toward the removal of barriers to the single market for transport services. The removal of these obstacles has been important for economic efficiency; however the absence of appropriate countervailing actions in response to this development has led to increased EU transport demand. Therefore, the need to introduce charging for transport infrastructure and external costs has been consistently argued by the Commission since its 1996 Green Paper ‘Towards fair and efficient pricing in Transport’ COM(95)691 final. and most recently in its 2001 Transport White Paper ‘European transport policy for 2010: time to decide’ COM(2001)370 final. . The absence of proper charges leads to excessive demand and inefficient utilisation of the available infrastructure through congestion. It also results in increased pollution, noise, energy use and deaths and injury. To move forward with this policy, the Commission is currently preparing a communication on efficient transport infrastructure charges. As a result of Council Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985. of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the impact of projects on the environment, as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 OJ L 73, 14.3.1997. and Directive 2003/35/EC OJ L 156, 25.6.2003. of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003, infrastructure projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are subject to an assessment with regard to their effects. This environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedure requires the environmental consequences of projects to be identified and assessed before authorisation is given. The public can give its opinion and all results are taken into account in the authorisation procedure of the project. The public must be informed of the decision afterwards. An assessment, such as the one referred to carried out by the Rijkswaterstaat showing that charging for the use of existing roads is a possible alternative to the project, could be a factor to be considered in the EIA, although it has to be noted that there is no indication in the directive of which specific alternatives should be taken into account. According to Article 6, paragraph 4 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. a project or plan that will adversely affect a special area of conservation can
