Question for Question Time H-000242/2011 to the Commission Part-session: July 2011 Rule 116 Spyros Danellis (S&D) Subject: The Checkpoint of the Future On 7 June, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) presented a new plan for security controls as a solution to the inconvenience caused by current measures at airports. This would allow a special group of passengers ('trusted' or 'regular' travellers) to pass with few controls, and controls to be correspondingly tightened for others (X-rays, other detectors, behaviour monitoring). With the shift of controls to the personal data of passengers before they reach the airport, this proposed system will look for 'bad people' rather than 'bad objects'. An interim version of the Checkpoint of the Future will be ready in the next two to three years. In view of the above, will the Commission say: are Member States entitled to adopt such a system without a review of the relevant EU regulations? Is it seeking alternative ways of shortening controls which will not focus on the personal data of passengers?
