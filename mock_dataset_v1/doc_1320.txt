Question for written answer E-011064/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (6 December 2011) Subject: A war of espionage in the Mediterranean According to an article published in the Turkish newspaper Sabah, a new unit on Cyprus, oil exploration in the Mediterranean and Israel has been formed within the Turkish National Intelligence Agency (MIT). The newspaper alleges that the tension in the Eastern Mediterranean brought about by hydrocarbon exploration has developed into a war of espionage. The paper writes that ‘following the crisis in the Mediterranean, a special unit has been set up within MIT staffed with specialists in matters of oil, Cyprus and Israel’. Sabah goes on to say that this unit ‘will carry out various intelligence operations in Southern Cyprus, Egypt, Libya, Syria and the Lebanon’ and that ‘the war of espionage in the region has developed into a war to discover the volume of oil deposits in each sea block’. According to the paper, this new MIT unit ‘has upset the intelligence services of Israel and Greece (Mossad and the EYP)’. Sabah also writes that the National Guard General Staff, ‘at the suggestion of Mossad and the EYP’, has banned soldiers from travelling to the occupied areas of Cyprus, adding that ‘In the light of Turkey’s increased spying activity, Mossad has entered into a secret agreement with the EYP and has started to direct the spying operations of the Greek Cypriot side.’ Will the Commission say if it is aware of this situation and what action it can take to bring calm to the region.
