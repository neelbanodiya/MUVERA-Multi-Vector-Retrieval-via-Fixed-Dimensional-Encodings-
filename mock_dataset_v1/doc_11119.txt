Joint answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-6824/08 , E-6964/08 (24 February 2009) According to the firmly established case-law of the European Court of Justice Member States may impose differential taxation on similar goods on the basis of objective criteria. However, such a differentiation must not produce protective effects and discriminate against the competing goods coming from other Member States. The Commission is currently examining whether the recent amendments introduced by the Romanian Government to the Emergency Ordinance No 50/2008 are compatible with Community legislation and in particular Article 90 of the EC Treaty. The Commission has received a large number of complaints on this matter, therefore, following the completion of this investigation it will issue a communication in order to inform all the persons concerned.
