open up network competition fully, in accordance with the new telecoms framework rules; calls on national regulators to use their powers to avoid both subsidies which distort the market and the emergence and abuse of dominant market positions, and where appropriate, to follow public procurement rules to ensure fair competition; 3. Highlights the importance of competitive markets in achieving affordable broadband, and emphasises the need for swift implementation and full enforcement by Member States and national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of the revised EU telecoms framework and the Recommendation on next generation access (NGA) networks; 4. Stresses that broadband services are essential for the competitiveness of the economy and are a prerequisite if all regions and social groups are to participate in digital life in the EU; 5. Considers that the investment risks involved in rolling out new networks can be reduced by measures to drive demand, in particular in the areas of e‑procurement, e‑commerce, e‑governance, e‑health services, interactive e‑education, and low-carbon interactive energy-saving devices; 6. Highlights the importance of public pre-commercial procurement of R&D-based solutions for the aforementioned sectors as a means to stimulate a virtuous cycle of technological development and demand for high-speed broadband services; 7. Notes that simplification and streamlining of the subsidy procedure would help to speed up the introduction of broadband technology; calls on the Commission to clarify State aid rules and to ensure that State aid is targeted at measures that stimulate or consolidate demand; 8. Calls for specific measures to be taken to ensure that SMEs can fully enjoy the potential of broadband in the fields of e‑commerce and e‑procurement; calls on the Commission to exchange best practices and to consider taking on board a specific programme for SMEs and broadband connectivity as part of its Digital Agenda flagship initiative; 9. Calls on Member States to promote and extend high-speed open-access connectivity to important public infrastructure (schools, hospitals and other public institutions) located in remote areas, as a means of improving public service and anchoring high-speed connectivity in remote regions, thereby decreasing investment costs for local private distribution; 10. Stresses that, in order to optimise its impact and its benefits to society, broadband deployment should be coupled with demand-awareness information and educational programmes; 11. Notes the difficulty in meeting the Europe 2020 broadband targets, given consumer, business and public-sector financial resources; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the use of
