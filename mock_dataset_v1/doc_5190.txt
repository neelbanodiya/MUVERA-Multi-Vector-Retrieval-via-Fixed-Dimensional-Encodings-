WRITTEN QUESTION P-0636/09 by Anne Van Lancker (PSE) to the Commission (3 February 2009) Subject: Implementation of the ‘public procurement procedures, grant award procedures and rules of origin’ laid down in the regulation establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 OJ L 378, 27.12.2006, p. 41. of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation deals with public procurement procedures, grant award procedures and rules of origin. Article 31(11) states the following: ‘In order to accelerate the eradication of poverty through the promotion of local capacities, markets and purchases, special consideration shall be given to local and regional procurement in partner countries. Tenderers who have been awarded contracts shall respect internationally agreed core labour standards, e.g. the ILO core labour standards, conventions on freedom of association and collective bargaining, elimination of forced and compulsory labour, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the abolition of child labour. Access by developing countries to Community assistance shall be rendered possible by all such technical assistance as is deemed appropriate.’ How does the Commission check that these legal requirements are implemented? Which department is responsible? Does the Commission receive regular internal reports on their implementation? If so, is it possible to see them? Are there any statistics on the subject?
