the need for the codification of nanomaterials, which will lead to the drawing up of standards, which will in turn boost efforts to identify any risks; calls on the Commission to take the necessary initiatives to this effect; 8. Emphasises that understanding of the potential damage to health and the environment of new, synthetic nanoparticles is still limited and, consequently, the effects of nanoparticles that are not readily soluble or biodegradable should be investigated, in accordance with the precautionary principle, before such particles go into production and are put on the market; 9. Stresses that assessment of the technological risks posed (from conception to disposal or recycling) to human health, consumers, workers and the environment must be carried out throughout the life cycle of N&N products; 10. Considers that, within the framework of the new European legislation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH), nanoforms of existing materials should be treated as new substances, because of their unique properties; in particular, the question of whether the threshold levels for production and import laid down within that framework are also adequate for nanoparticles should be investigated; 11. Emphasises the importance of miniaturisation of products with regard to helping reduce waste and ensure better use of energy; 12. Supports the Commission's intention to address problems at an early stage with a view to the development of these promising future technologies; 13. Supports the efforts made by the Commission to take part, and speak with one voice, in the debate at the international level, to ensure a balanced discussion of N&N.
