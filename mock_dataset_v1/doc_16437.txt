used as a standard solution of non-ionic surfactants for the degradation test. The solution should be kept at a temperature below 5 °C. 5.4.5. Regeneration of ion exchange resins The cation exchanger is rejected after use. Passing about 5 000-6 000 ml of ammonium bicarbonate solution (5.3.4) down the column at a flow rate of approximately 10 ml/min until the eluate is free from anionic surfactants (methylene blue test) regenerates the anion-exchange resin. Then pass 2 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture (5.3.3) down the anion exchanger to wash. The anion exchanger is again ready for operation. Figure 1 Activated sludge plant: overviews A.
