areas of the fisheries sector it is necessary to stress that the European fisheries industry is extremely dependent on the European budget: of the total amount of € 1.1 billion provided by the European Union and national and regional authorities, about € 900 million come from EU budget. The Preliminary Draft Budget presented by the Commission allocates € 1.08 billion to fisheries, registering an increase of 2.7% in comparison with the previous budget. In general terms the proposal follows the trend of the previous one, particularly as regards the implementation of the CFP as reformed in 2002. The Commission sets up: - an increase in the number of Regional Advisory Councils (RAC); in line with the objectives of the CFP reform. Regarding the maritime area, the Commission proposes two initiatives whose implementation requires an increase of the total amount - extension of the competence to maritime affairs. An additional amount of money will be necessary to cover the elaboration of a "Green Paper" on the European Union Future Maritime Policy and the organisation of a conference on the Green Paper; - the expenditure in the area of the Law of the Sea; which comes under Chapter 11 Fisheries and an amount for the contribution to the United Nations of € 200.000 has been foreseen. As regards the headings; the draft budget allocates € 33.200.000 in commitment appropriations under Heading I (Agriculture). The total amount is unchanged from the one tabled by the Commission in 2005. On the other hand Heading II (Structural Operations) registers an increase in terms of allocation in commitment appropriations, the amount going up from € 680.500 in 2005 to about € 696.800. For the actions under Heading III (Internal Policies) the amount goes up from about € 106.000.000 allocated in 2005 to about € 108.000.000 in commitment appropriations, registering an increase of 2.1%. For Heading IV (External Action), which includes international agreements covered by the conciliation procedure, the draft report assigns about € 202.100.000 in commitment appropriations, registering an increase of € 5,9 million (3% more than in the previous budget). The budget for 2006, as regards the fisheries sector, has been drawn up in a spirit of continuity with the past. Whereas, in general terms, the proposal is well structured, it is necessary to underline that the Commission should take into account the consequences of the last and the next European Enlargement, whose impact produces
