Reply (4 April 2011) In its conclusions of 31 January 2011, the Council expressed its continuing deep concern about the increasing violence in Darfur. It urged all parties to cease hostilities and ensure full and unhindered access for UNAMID and humanitarian workers. This matter has been raised on a number of occasions with the Sudanese authorities both by the EU Delegation in Khartoum and by the EU Special Representative for Sudan. These messages have also been conveyed in contacts with the United Nations, the African Union, and donor organisations. The Union continues to provide humanitarian funding to those organisations that are still able to work in Darfur. It also supports humanitarian organisations on the ground by financing essential logistics, transport, advocacy, as well as coordination activities such as the UN humanitarian air service, the operations of the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and NGO coordination.
