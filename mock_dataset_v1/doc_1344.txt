WRITTEN QUESTION E-3356/10 by Franz Obermayr (NI) to the Commission (12 May 2010) Subject: Erasmus for officials at regional and local level The Committee on Regional Development, amongst others, is currently discussing a pilot project by the Commission for Europe-wide exchanges of local authority officials. In my opinion, this project makes perfect sense, as it would allow tried and tested practices to be exchanged in areas where similar problems have arisen. Nevertheless, there are clearly some people who are against the Erasmus project for regional and local politicians, saying that the project entails excessive, disproportionate administrative costs and is perceived more as a short holiday by the participants than for training benefits. In addition, the linguistic problems of such an exchange programme have also been broached. 1. What is the Commission's stance on these criticisms? 2. How could disproportionate administrative costs be avoided? 3. Are there any figures showing that the programme has had a positive or negative impact to date? 4. If so, will these figures be made available to Parliament? 5. What precise form will the selection process for the officials involved in an exchange take? 6. What body is responsible for this process and will selection be carried out in the places concerned? 7. Will the officials' knowledge of languages be suitably tested? 8. How can the added value of Erasmus be efficiently and meaningfully evaluated?
