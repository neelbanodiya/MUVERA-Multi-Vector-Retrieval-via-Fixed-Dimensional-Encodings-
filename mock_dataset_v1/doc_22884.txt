law, and, in particular, strengthening electoral processes around the world, but stresses the need to ensure a coherent post-electoral policy, paying particular attention to convergence between technical and political follow-up and input from civil society, so that development support is consistent with democratic principles and democratic governance values; 20. Calls on the Commission to build further on its successful cooperation with the United Nations on election observation missions and to strengthen common strategy-building and project design with the UN and other regional organisations, such as the OSCE and the African Union, in connection with the promotion of democracy and human rights; 21. Stresses that the EU's democracy-building efforts should more systematically include a special focus on the role of elected representatives and political parties, an independent judiciary and the media and on the strengthening of women's participation in political and public life; underlines, further, the importance of supporting political foundations, non-governmental organisations and academic institutions; 22. Recommends the introduction of a specific strategy to support newly democratically-elected parliaments with a view to permanently entrenching democracy, the rule of law and good governance; calls, further, for the development of a peer-to-peer instrument involving parliamentarians of different nationalities with a view to determining what constitutes efficient and effective representation of the interests of the electorate, efficient and effective oversight of the executive and ways and means of maintaining a flow of information between all parts of the governance system; 23. Confirms its own determination to contribute to the strengthening of democratic processes by enhancing its involvement in election observation, follow-up to EU EOMs and parliamentary capacity-building; calls, in that connection, on its Office for Promotion of Parliamentary Democracy (OPPD) to present a comprehensive action plan to the relevant parliamentary committees which should necessarily include a clear mechanism for cooperation with interparliamentary delegations and joint parliamentary committees; underlines, further, the importance of involving parliamentary assemblies, such as the ACP-EU, EUROLAT, EUROMED and EURONEST assemblies, in this process; 24. Encourages the Commission delegations to work in partnership with the OPPD when considering or initiating parliamentary support programmes; 25. Recommends that an action plan be included in the November Council conclusions and that a review of the progress made be carried out by the end of 2010; requests the current and forthcoming EU Presidencies to present the outcome of the General Affairs and External Relations Council meetings to its committees responsible; 26. Instructs its President
