as the need for such mobility; considers that any adverse impact of labour mobility on individual pension entitlements must be kept to a minimum; observes that Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems regulates mobility for the first pillar; notes that no such framework yet exists for the second pillar; observes that various attempts have already been made to fill this lacuna in European law; encourages the Commission to find a solution to this fundamental problem as quickly as possible; 33. Welcomes the fact that some Member States operate pension tracing services which help people keep track of their pension rights from different sources within that Member State; encourages other Member States to develop similar systems; considers that ultimately it would be useful to interlink these national pension tracing services at EU level in order to promote the mobility of workers; REVIEW OF EU LEGISLATION 34. Observes that, where powers relating to pensions are vested in the European Union, European law is very fragmented; calls on the Commission to investigate whether it would be appropriate to rationalise this regulatory framework as part of better regulation; CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 35. Considers that proposals for a solvency regime for IORPs must recognise the specificities of pensions, bearing in mind that risks in the insurance sector are different from those faced by IORPs, in particular as regards the conditionality of pension rights, the duration of pension portfolios and the fact that IORPs are special-purpose vehicles operating a homogenous product portfolio; stresses that the key aim of such a regime would be to provide enhanced protection to current and future pensioners; believes that the impact of such proposals needs to be fully assessed, in particular with a view to quantifying the additional costs and administrative burden; believes that any revision of a solvency regime for IORPs should be carried out within the framework of the existing IORP Directive; 36. Stresses, in line with the Commission’s statement in the Green Paper, that the IORP Directive is based on a Solvency I minimum harmonisation approach, whereas, in the near future, insurance undertakings will apply the risk-based Solvency II regime even for their occupational pension activity; 37. Stresses that financial markets can function efficiently only when there is confidence and trust and considers that confidence and trust require solid prudential rules for financial institutions, and that IORPs should be no exception to this; 38.
