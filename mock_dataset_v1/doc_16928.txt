The results will be forwarded to the EFSA before the end of May 2008 and analysed. Finally, the EFSA is preparing a scientific opinion on food-borne antimicrobial resistance as a biological hazard, including the identification of potential control options. It is expected that the opinion will be adopted this summer. It is appropriate to await the results from the above intensified monitoring and the risk assessment before potential management options for MRSA and antimicrobial resistance in pig production in general are considered. With regard to infection prevention and control in humans, the Commission is developing a proposal on Patient Safety which will include recommendations on the prevention and control of infections with microorganisms such as MRSA in healthcare settings. A public consultation on strategies for improving patient safety by prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections was held in early 2006 and can be found at the following link: http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_threats/com/cons01_txt_en.pdf. The Commission intends to adopt the proposal on Patient Safety end 2008.
