Answer given by Ms Wallström on behalf of the Commission (4 September 2008) The Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member that it is the practice of the Commission not to comment on statements by politicians in Member States. As regards the ratification process, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member on the European Council's conclusions. Heads of State or Government decided to come back to this issue in October 2008. At the same time, they outlined that the national parliaments of several Member States have approved the Treaty and that the ratification process continues in other countries.
