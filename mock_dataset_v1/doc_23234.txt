or the European Parliament has little to do about such matters as they fall outside the scope of the competences of the Union. According to statistics, in 2009 the European Parliament received 1924 petitions, a slight increase compared to the 1849 submitted in 2008. It may also be said that such a small difference indicates a certain stagnation after the constant ascending trend recorded following the 2004 and 2007 enlargement of the Union. About forty-six percent of the petitions received in 2009 were declared admissible, a percentage almost similar to the one recorded in 2008. Out of the 688 petitions deemed admissible, 655 were sent to the European Commission for information. It is worthwhile underlining that the latter sent about 300 communications referring to petitions registered in 2009. As far as inadmissible petitions are concerned the situation is very similar to the previous year (812 against 818). As the percentage of inadmissible petitions remains quite high (slightly over half of the petitions received), it is obvious that efforts should be stepped up to enforce previous and current recommendations aiming to better inform the citizens about EU competences. Petition Adoption Decision No. of petitions % No. of petitions % 2009 2008 Admissible 688 45.9 708 46.4 Inadmissible 812 54.1 818 53.6 Admissible and Close 420 N/A 354 N/A Petition sent to EC for opinion 655 N/A 729 N/A Petition sent for opinion to other bodies 33 N/A 53 N/A Petition sent for information to other bodies 207 N/A 207 N/A Not Recorded 4 N/A 6 N/A One should also note that about two thirds of the 2009 petitions, i.e. 1232 were closed at early stages of the procedure be it because they were deemed inadmissible or because, although admissible, they were closed immediately after providing the petitioners with information on the matters raised or after being re-directed to other EP Committees in whose remit they fell. Yet again 2009 and 2008 statistics are comparable as it may be noted from the data below. 2009 Adoption Decision Number of petitions Percentage Admissible 1,062 56.3 Inadmissible 818 43.4 Not recorded 6 0.3 2008 Adoption Decision Number of petitions Percentage Admissible 1,108 57.6 Inadmissible 812 42.2 Not recorded 4 0.2 Against this background, it should be reminded that Members have repeatedly called the attention on the so-called non-petitions, arguing that processing them is unnecessarily time consuming. Although no definition of a non-petition is available,
