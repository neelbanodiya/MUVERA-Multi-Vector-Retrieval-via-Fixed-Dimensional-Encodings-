Reply (29 November 2010) The Council has no knowledge of the incidents referred to in the question involving a Libyan patrol boat and a fishing boat flying the flag of a European Union Member State. The Honourable Member is informed that the Presidency of the Council of the European Union had made a démarche to the Libyan authorities in December 2005 following the adoption by Libya, on 20 and 21 June 2005 respectively, of resolution 104 on the straight baseline of Libyan territorial waters and resolution 105 on the delimitation of a Libyan fisheries protection zone. In this regard the verbal note sent by the embassy of the State holding the Presidency of the Council stated that the straight baselines as marked out by Libya had been drawn in accordance with arrangements that did not comply with the provisions of applicable international law, in particular those of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea concerning lines of delimitation in marine bays. It should also be pointed out that the 10 European Community Member States had protested to Libya in 1985 after that country proclaimed its sovereignty over the Gulf of Sidra. In addition, the European Union encourages Libya, in the framework of the negotiations on the framework agreement with that country, to ratify and implement the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
