Question for written answer E-001588/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (9 February 2012) Subject: SuperCooling Researchers at the University of Coimbra (Portugal) have developed an innovative cooling technology that allows food and drink to be cooled 10 times faster than traditional equipment such as refrigerators. SuperCooling is a rapid cooling system comparable to the heating of products in a microwave. The new vacuum cooling system is still at the prototype stage, but early results are promising for the researchers; they were able to a cool a 33 cl bottle of water in three minutes, according to a press release issued today by the university. Is the Commission aware of this new cooling system, which appears to have obvious energy and environmental benefits? Does it consider the development of this new system and support for this research to be justified or not?
