Reply (21 September 2009) As the Honourable Member has already indicated in his question, the flat‑rate payment of travel expenses from the place of work to the place of origin is governed, in the case of officials, by Article 8 of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and, in the case of temporary and contract staff who have been employed for at least nine months, by Articles 26 and 92 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants (CEOS). In 2008, 2603 officials, temporary and contract staff were entitled to the payment by the Council of travel expenses under these rules. Since the payments are made automatically on a flat‑rate basis rather than on application or on the production of supporting documents, the number of those entitled to such a payment is the same as the number of those who benefited from it. For the year in question, the Council General Secretariat's expenses under the abovementioned rules amounted to EUR 4 541 783.64.
