Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take all necessary measures to ensure that goods imported with a view to being placed on the European Union market comply with European consumer protection standards, particularly as regards health and safety, to prevent the circulation of products or substances which could be dangerous for consumers; A worrying erosion of freedom in the name of security 22.
