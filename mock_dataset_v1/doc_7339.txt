Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (2 May 2011) The issue of gender balance in company boards has been addressed in a comprehensive manner by the Commission in its Strategy for Equality between Women and Men (2010‑15) http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=422&langId=en and in the follow-up given to this Strategy by the Commission See details in the Commission Staff Working Document ‘The Gender Balance in Business Leadership’, SEC(2011)246 final. . In this context, on 1 March 2011, the Vice-President of the Commission responsible for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship encouraged publicly listed companies to sign the ‘Women on the Board Pledge for Europe’ http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/reding/pdf/news/boardroom_pledge_final_en.pdf and to develop self-regulatory initiatives to get more women into top jobs, with a view of reaching the target of 30 % of women on boardrooms of listed companies by 2015 and 40 % by 2020. Questions on best ways to improve gender balance in boards were included in the Green Paper on Corporate Governance in Financial Institutions published in June 2010 http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/corporate_governance_in_financial_institutions_en.htm . A new consultation on corporate governance was launched on 5 April 2011 through the Green Paper on EU Corporate Governance Framework http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/company/modern/corporate-governance-framework_en.htm . The consultation, which also comprises questions on improving gender balance in boards, is open till 22 July 2010. All interested parties are encouraged to contribute. The Commission is taking stock and monitoring the progress achieved, in particular by collecting and disseminating comparable data at EU level through its database on women and men in decision-making http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=764&langId=en and regular reporting http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=762&langId=en&furtherPubs=yes . If no progress is made, the Commission will decide next year on further initiatives in this field and on their nature.
