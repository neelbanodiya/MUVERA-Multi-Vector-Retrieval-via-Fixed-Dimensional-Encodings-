18% gas, 14% RES and 5% oil, I. whereas final energy intensity in the EU-25 has regularly been reduced, so that about 70% of the energy used for a unit of economic output in 1980 is required in 2004; whereas overall primary energy consumption in the EU-25 has been growing at an average rate of 0.8% per year, equivalent to 0.5% per capita per year, during the same period, J. whereas 59% of the oil consumed in Europe in 2004 is used by the transport sector, 17% in buildings, 16% in non-energy uses and 8% in industry; whereas the Commission expects energy demand in the transport sector to grow by at least 30% by 2030, with an increase of up to 5% per year for air transport, K. whereas 29% of the gas consumed in the EU-25 in 2004 was used for the production of electricity, with the remaining 71% used in non-electricity production (industry, housing, etc), L. whereas demand for coal in the EU has been decreasing for many years, and import dependency is already 50% and is rising as a proportion of consumption of coal, M. whereas thirteen Member States generate nuclear electricity and certain Member States have a declared policy of phasing out nuclear power, N. whereas the EU energy market is, at the present time, not integrated and not sufficiently competitive, O. whereas the EU has set targets for increasing the share of energy consumption from RES from 6% to 12% and to 22.1% for electricity and 5.75% for fuel by 2010; whereas these targets can be attained if all Member States adjust their policies accordingly, P. whereas the EU has adopted the Energy End-use Efficiency and Energy Services directive requiring Member States to produce a series of action plans setting out their energy-saving strategies over the next nine years, Q. whereas RES are mainly from indigenous sources and could be used in all sectors, i.e. electricity, heating and cooling and transport, R. whereas, according to the last Eurobarometer on Energy, almost half of all EU citizens (48%) believe that their national government should focus on developing the use of solar power, followed by promoting advanced research for new energy technologies (41%) and developing the use of wind power (31%), whilst regulation to reduce dependence on oil (23%) and developing the use of nuclear power (12%) are less appreciated among respondents, S. whereas the EU should
