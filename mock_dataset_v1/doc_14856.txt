not to wait for Yawovi Agboyibo to request a pardon before releasing him, thereby demonstrating that the President’s faction will ensure that the Togolese opposition is able to express its views fully and freely during the forthcoming elections; 2. Welcomes the recent decrees by the President of the Togolese Republic setting new dates for procedures to revise the electoral roll and for the first round of the general election, which is now scheduled for 10 March 2002; 3. Calls on the Togolese Government, in that connection, and as a guarantee of transparency, to agree to the presence of a delegation from the European Union and the European Parliament, whose task would be to supervise the proper conduct of the procedures; 4. Calls on the European Union to approach the Togolese authorities with a view to outlining how it would contribute in order to help them overcome difficulties of all kinds which could arise throughout the preparations for such a major election; 5. Calls on the Togolese President and Government to refrain from making any arbitrary and unilateral changes to the Constitution affecting the substance of the Lomé agreements; calls, therefore, on the Togolese President and Government to submit any substantive change affecting the country's political institutions to a vote by the Togolese people, within the framework of free elections to which all the nation's political movements and their representatives are admitted; 6. Calls on the European Union to respond to the resumption of the electoral process in Togo by stepping up its policy of cooperation and development with the country, suspending it only in the event of serious violations of human rights and democratic principles which bring an end to the confidence pact and the inter-Togolese dialogue which were the objectives of the Lomé agreements; 7. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council, the ACP-EU Council of Ministers and the Togolese Government.
