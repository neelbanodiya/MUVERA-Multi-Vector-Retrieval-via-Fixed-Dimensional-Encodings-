on-board aircraft when certain security conditions are met by the third country, including the ‘tamper evident’ bag system. The Commission developed, in Commission Regulation (EC) No 915/2007 Commission Regulation (EC) No 915/2007 of 31 July 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security, OJ L 200 of 1.8.2007 . as replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 820/2008, OJ L 221, 19.8.2008 . , a means of establishing equivalence of security measures for liquids sold at third country airports. To date, two States — Singapore and Croatia — have successfully completed this procedure. As a consequence liquids bought at seven airports in these two States are exempted from confiscation at security points at Community airports (provided the liquid is in a tamper-evident bag and that it also displays satisfactory proof of purchase on airside at the airport within the preceding 36 hours). Two further States — the United States (US) and the Republic of Korea — are at an advanced stage of the process. Once completed, this should provide a solution in the future to the situation met by the constituent of the Honourable Member for flights from the US.
