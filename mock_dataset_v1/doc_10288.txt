9999/C Q999 E/180 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3844/03 by Camilo Nogueira Román (Verts/ALE) to the Council (04 December 2003) Subject: Death of 36 African immigrants drowned off Rota in Andalusia On 25 October 2003 36 African immigrants were drowned off Rota when their patera (small boat) sank without the Spanish police and immigration services providing any assistance, although this had been requested by the captain of the vessel Focs Tenerife when he saw that the small boat was in difficulties. He claims that despite his alert, and with the patera close to the shore, the Spanish Government services took two and a half hours to reach the scene of the shipwreck, when 36 of the 50 immigrants on board had already drowned. The incident took place off the Hispano-American naval base at Rota, which had all the requisite means for a salvage operation at its disposal. Several of the lifeboats belonging to the usual Spanish services were out of action, and furthermore, various officials concerned were absent. Is the Council aware of this particularly tragic accident, which joins a very long list of daily occurrences of this kind? Has the Council sought clarification from the Spanish authorities as to the behaviour of its police and lifeboat services? What political and legal measures does the Council intend to put into operation to prevent similar tragedies?
