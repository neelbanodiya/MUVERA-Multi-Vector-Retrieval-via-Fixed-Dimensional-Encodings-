(new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment ia)'making available' means the preparation, manipulation, preservation, packaging and transport of human organs; Justification While the Tissues Directive 2004/23/EG defines the terms 'procurement', 'processing' and 'preservation', the proposal for a Directive under review only defines the terms 'procurement' and 'preservation'.
