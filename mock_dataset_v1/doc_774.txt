Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (10 April 2007) Following the opinion delivered by the Parliament on 14 December 2006, the proposal for a Council regulation establishing an instrument for nuclear safety cooperation was approved on 14 February 2007. It is envisaged that funding from the instrument for nuclear safety cooperation will be allocated for the construction of the new safe confinement (the new shell over the damaged reactor at Chernobyl). This will take place in accordance with the objectives of the instrument and the historical burden sharing amongst the donors of the Chernobyl Shelter Fund.
