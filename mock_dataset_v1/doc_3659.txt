Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2006) The EU emission trading scheme puts a price on carbon for the industries covered. These industries, e.g. the power sector, are able to decide the extent to which they pass on this price of carbon in the goods and services they offer. This decision varies according to the market conditions under which industries operate. Through this process of cost pass-through, consumers base their purchase decisions not just on the cost of producing a particular good or service but also on the impact that this good or service has on the environment. By way of example, decisions taken by consumers today regarding the quantity of electricity they wish to purchase will be influenced by changes in the costs of producing electricity due to strong oil price increases as well as, to a lesser extent, by the price of carbon. It is also important that markets connected to the EU scheme are operating as intended. The Commission has urged Member States to improve competition notably in the internal energy market, by speeding up full implementation of community internal market legislation to ensure sound competition in all energy markets. As regards compliance with the EU’s Kyoto Protocol commitment, companies facing difficulty in remaining within their emissions limit have a choice between taking measures to reduce their emissions, such as investing in more efficient technology or using a less carbon-intensive energy source, buying the extra allowances they need at the market rate, or a combination of the two, whichever is cheapest. This ensures that emissions are reduced in the most cost-effective way and that the EU scheme brings about real reductions of greenhouse gas emissions.
