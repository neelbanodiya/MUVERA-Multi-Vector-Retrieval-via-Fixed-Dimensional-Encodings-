comprising French, US and Canadian military personnel to be replaced with United Nations peace-keepers on the date decided by the Security Council. The House welcomes the Commission emergency funding of 1.8 million euro but calls for EU and international aid to increase, in order not only to address humanitarian needs but also to provide long-term assistance with the reconstruction of the legal system and the national police and security forces on a basis of respect for human rights and the rule of law. Finally, Parliament calls on the Commission to step up its humanitarian and health aid, in particular by responding to the appeals of the International Red Cross and providing victims of violence with specific assistance.
