before the end of this decade the availability of petroleum worldwide will fall annually by 2-3%; considering that the increasing scarcity of petroleum resources is likely to result in a further increase in the price of crude oil, which will be reflected in the price of natural gas, F. whereas increasing the share of renewables in energy consumption and improving energy efficiency is an important way to reduce Europe's external energy dependency; notes that impressive cost reductions have been achieved in different renewable energy technologies, in some cases up to 50% in 15 years; notes that at least 25% of the overall energy consumption of the EU could be provided by renewable energies by 2020, G. whereas the economic potential for possible energy savings by 2010 is 17% of current energy end-use consumption for industry, 22% of energy end-use consumption for households and the services sector and 14% of energy consumption for transport; whereas therefore, total consumption in the EU could be reduced by around 20% without reducing comfort or standards of living, H. whereas oil consumption in the EU is increasing; whereas, in particular, the transport sector is responsible for 78% of the increase in end-use energy demand since 1985, and it is estimated that over the next ten years that sector will expand by 2% per year and will become even more energy-intensive, I. whereas the price of oil is affected by several factors, i.e.: the lack of investment in exploration and refining capacity; the considerable increase in demand for oil in recent years, mostly from China and India; political instability in the Middle East; weather incidents; and price speculation, 1. Considers Europe's dependence on oil and oil imports to be a matter of great concern; believes that in order to ensure energy supply, Europe should diversify energy sources and origins of supply and strengthen its strategy to promote decentralised renewable energy sources as a matter of urgency; 2. Calls for a comprehensive and coherent global strategy to promote energy saving and efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources, in view of the very high oil consumption in the US as well as increasing oil consumption in, especially, large emerging economies such as China and India; calls on the EU rapidly to take the initiative to hold a world summit of the larger oil consumer and producer countries; 3. Highlights the geostrategic aspects of our dependence on
