Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (17 February 2012) The Commission understands from the text of the parliamentary question that the report mentioned by the Honourable Member is an internal report by the administration of the Parliament produced upon request of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. The Commission is not aware of the content of the report. It is therefore not in the position to comment on the findings of the report and to answer the detailed inquiries formulated in the parliamentary question. The Commission is carefully monitoring the situation of gender equality in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt). It also maintains an open and frank dialogue on this and other human rights issues within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) most notably in the subcommittee on ‘Human Rights, Good Governance and Rule of Law’.
