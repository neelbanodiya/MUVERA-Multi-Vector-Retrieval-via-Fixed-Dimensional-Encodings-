Question for written answer E-000690/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Ana Miranda (Verts/ALE) (30 January 2012) Subject: Use of EU funds on bullfighting I Countries such as Spain and Portugal, where bullfights are legal, are using EU funds for activities relating to bullfighting, such as the renovation of bullrings. There have been several examples of this over recent years, such as EUR 180 287.37 from the Leader+ programme being used by the local authority in Pozoblanco (Córdoba) to create an audiovisual tour of the town’s bullring under project number GDR-CO-05-1.3-167. In Benamejí (Córdoba), EUR 25 975.11 from the Rural Development Programme (Proder) were spent on the local authority’s bullring under the heading ‘minor repairs’. The bullring in Bélmez (Córdoba) was renovated with the help of EUR 300 000 in European funding from Proder Andalusia. In January 2011, the local authority in Fuente del Maestre (Badajoz) announced that its bullring would be renovated using Proder funding to the tune of EUR 143 252. There are also examples of this happening in Portugal. Estremoz will be spending EUR 875 160 of ERDF cohesion funding to renovate its bullring. Other towns will be using POLIS programme funds to renovate bullrings. Around EUR 41 000 of Proder funding was used to renovate the bullring in Santo António das Areias. The plaque displayed to mark the inauguration of the renovated bullring has EU logos on it. This shows a lack of respect for true European cohesion and solidarity. — What does the Commission think about regional and rural development funding being used to renovate facilities in which animals are mistreated for entertainment? — Does the Commission have evidence of this kind of funding being spent on activities linked to bullrings? — Are there any steps that the Commission can take to check that EU funds are being spent properly and appropriately in the Member States? — Does the Commission consider it right to finance a macabre spectacle that is only legal in 3 of the 27 Member States?
