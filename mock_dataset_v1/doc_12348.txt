Reply (18 May 2009) The theme of the 42nd Session of the UN Commission on Population and Development (New York, 30 March‑3 April 2009) is particularly timely given that in 2010 the international community is due to assess progress in the achievement of the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs), five years ahead of the target year of 2015. Human beings are at the core of every one of the MDGs, and the Cairo/ICPD process is therefore particularly important in the contribution it can make to their achievement. This role has been recognised in the European Consensus on Development, which states that the EU is determined to work to assist the achievement of the development goals and objectives agreed at the major UN conferences and summits (paragraph 8) and that the MDGs cannot be attained without progress in achieving the goal of universal sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHRs) as set out in the ICPD Cairo Agenda (paragraph 94). In terms of the achievement of the MDGs, in June 2008 the European Council welcomed the EU Agenda for Action on MDGs 11096/08. . The EU proposed to its partners in development to share this agenda, which identifies, within time frames, specific milestones and actions in the context of pro‑poor and pro-growth development in key areas, such as the reduction of poverty and hunger, education, health, environment, gender equality and the empowerment of women, water, agriculture, private sector and infrastructure, that will contribute to ensuring the achievement of the MDGs by 2015. Together with our agreed positions in the European Consensus on Development and previous Council conclusions In particular, the Council conclusions of 23 November 2004 (15158/04) and 24 May 2005 (9266/05 and 9278/05). , the EU Agenda for Action on MDGs constituted the basis for the preparations of the 42nd Session of the UNCPD, which were carried out as usual by experts and by the Heads of Mission of the Member States and the Commission in New York. This work focused on reaching an EU position and on how to ensure active participation before and during the session. The Presidency delivered a statement on behalf of the EU on 30 March 2009 (see the Presidency website http://www.mzv.cz/un.newyork/en/czech_eu_presidency_2009/ statements_by_the_czech_presidency_on/statement_on_behalf_of_the_european_29.html ). The outcome of the 42nd session of the UNCPD, including the final statement and all the background documents and agendas, are available at the UNCPD website http://www.un.org/esa/population/cpd/cpd2009/comm2009.htm .
