Question for written answer E-5939/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Melo (PPE) (27 July 2010) Subject: Execution of Proder Axis 2 The Community support fund for rural development for 2007‑13 is a key assistance instrument available to Member States. Representatives of the sector have repeatedly drawn attention to the lack of efficiency on the part of the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture in utilising and executing the funds under this Community support framework, both for the first pillar, under which there is no co‑financing from the Member State, and for the second pillar, under which such co‑financing is required. Can the Commission provide information, with reference to Proder Axis 2, on what has already been executed as of June 2010 and what still remains to be executed, in order to ensure that no appropriations are lost under the N+2 rule?
