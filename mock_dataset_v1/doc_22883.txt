the Council and Commission implement the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda for Action on Aid Effectiveness in their democracy support work, and suggests, in particular, that joint EU democracy assessments, joint EU programming and burden-sharing be introduced with a view to increasing the impact and visibility of the EU's work to support democracy; 12. Underlines the importance of the human rights clauses already contained in EU agreements; reiterates, in this context, that such clauses should first be applied consistently in existing agreements, in preference to a process of devising new agreements incorporating additional conditions; 13. Suggests that the Commission should systematically include a section on the state of democracy and human rights in the Country Strategy Papers, incorporate recommendations from relevant EU EOMs, and, wherever appropriate, mainstream democracy support in programmes with partner countries; 14.
