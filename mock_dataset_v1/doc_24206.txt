WRITTEN QUESTION E-2103/07 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 April 2007) Subject: EU cooperation to prevent football-related violence The recent acts of vandalism in football in certain EU countries have led to a great deal of concern among sporting authorities and those responsible for maintaining public order. The President of UEFA recently commented that the EU should take part in an EU‑wide campaign to promote the traditional values of the sporting — and footballing — world, which include respect between all those involved in football. Does the Commission take the view that it should take up the suggestion by the President of UEFA and take part in an EU‑wide campaign to eradicate football-related violence and to encourage a return to respect for the traditional values of the sporting world?
