Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (24 April 2007) The Commission would like to note first that the Autonomous Community of Andalucía is one of the regions included in Case C‑235/04 against the Kingdom of Spain for insufficient designation of special protection areas (SPA) in accordance with Council Directive 79/409/EEC OJ L 103, 25.4.1979 as last amended by Directive 91/244/EEC, OJ L 115, 8.5.1991. of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, for which the Advocate General has delivered an opinion on September 2006. The Spanish authorities have not notified to the Commission the SPA designation referred to by the Honourable Member. If new SPA designations are submitted by the Spanish authorities, the Commission will then assess the completeness of the designations with a view to ensure that the most suitable territories have been classified as SPA in accordance with the provisions laid down in Article 4(1) and (2) of the Birds Directive. It is, however, worth highlighting that according to the Judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 July 1996 on Case C‑44/95, the site boundaries must be determined exclusively from the application of ornithological criteria. Therefore, socioeconomic reasons cannot be argued to justify the boundaries of sites. The Commission will not intervene in relation to the matters outlined in the written question until the Court of Justice has delivered its Judgment, and then only if it is established that there has been a breach of Community legislation.
