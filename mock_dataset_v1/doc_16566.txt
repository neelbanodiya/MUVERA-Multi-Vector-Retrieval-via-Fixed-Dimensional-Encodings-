Question for written answer P-007500/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (26 July 2011) Subject: Moncenisio railway tunnel After protracted work to modernise the Moncenisio railway tunnel, at a cost of EUR 300 million, which was co‑financed by the European Union, the French railway undertaking SNCF intends to restore services to and from Italy using high-speed trains. However, as from 2012, the Italian network operator RFI has scheduled maintenance work in the tunnel during the hours of maximum rail traffic, i.e. between 13.30 and 16.30 on Saturdays and Sundays. This decision will inevitably result in systematic delays and/or train cancellations during those periods, penalising the numerous passengers. Bearing in mind that: — it would be desirable to optimise the existing service on the historic Paris-Milan line in relation to the highly controversial new line between Turin and Lyon, — passengers would be the prime victims of the lack of agreement between RFI and the SNCF and — after years of inconvenience and huge investments — would be left with a worse service than in the past, — the ambitious European strategy Transport 2050 provides for a substantial increase in rail traffic to help reduce emissions of pollutants from transport by 60 % by 2050, will the Commission adopt specific measures to enhance the service for the public and optimise rail traffic through the aforementioned tunnel?
