for rewashing the cotton wool. Measure the absorbency of the chloroform solution with a photometer at 650 nm in 1 to 5 cm cells against chloroform. Run a blank determination through the whole procedure. 2.4. Calibration curve Prepare a calibration solution from the standard substance dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid methyl ester (tetrapropylene type mol. wt. 340) after saponification into the potassium salt. The MBAS is calculated as sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (mol. wt. 348). From a weighing pipette, weigh 400 to 450 mg of dodecyl-benzene-sulphonic-acid-methyl-ester (2.2.5) to the nearest 0 , 1 mg in a round-bottomed flask and add 50 ml of ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution (2.2.6) and some boiling granules. After mounting the reflux condenser, boil for one hour. After cooling, wash the condenser and ground glass joint with about 30 ml of ethanol, and add these washings to the contents of the flask. Titrate the solution with sulphuric acid against phenolphthalein until it becomes colourless. Transfer this solution to a 1 000 ml graduated flask (2.2.14), dilute to the mark with deionised water and mix. Part of this surfactant stock solution is then further diluted. Withdraw 25 ml, transfer to a 500 ml graduated flask (2.2.13), dilute to the mark with deionised water and mix. This standard solution contains: E x 1,023 mg MBAS per ml 20 000 where E is the sample weight in mg. To establish the calibration curve, withdraw 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 ml portions of the standard solution and dilute each to 100 ml with deionised water. Then proceed as stated under item 2.3 including a blank determination. 2.5. Calculation of results The amount of anionic surfactant (MBAS) in the sample is read from the calibration curve (2.4). The MBAS content of the sample is given by: EQ \F(mg MBAS × 1 000;V) = MBAS mg/l where: V = ml volume of the sample used. Express the results as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate (MW 348). 2.6. Expression of results Express the results as MBAS mg/l to the nearest 0,1. 3. Determination of non-ionic surfactants in biodegradation test liquors 3.1 Principle Surface active agents are concentrated and isolated by gas stripping. In the sample used, the quantity of non-ionic surfactant should be in the range 250-800 µg. The stripped surfactant is dissolved in ethyl acetate. After phase separation and evaporation of the solvent, the non-ionic surfactant is precipitated in aqueous solution with modified Dragendorff reagent (KBiI
