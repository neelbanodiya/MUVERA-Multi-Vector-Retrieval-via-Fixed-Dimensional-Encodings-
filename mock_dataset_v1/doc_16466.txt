2004/C 51 E/143 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1698/03 by Marco Cappato (NI) and Benedetto Della Vedova (NI) to the Council (22 May 2003) Subject: Closure of the Sudanese daily Khartoum Monitor According to the press agency MISNA, on 9 May the Sudanese authorities ordered the closure of the Khartoum Monitor , an English-language daily which the government had already found provocative because of a number of its articles on religion and the civil war in the south of the country. According to initial reports, backed up by the forces of law and order which closed the newspaper office, the action was taken because fines imposed earlier had not been paid. The Khartoum Monitor itself reports that the fines had in fact been partially cancelled following an appeal court sentence, whilst a small fine upheld by the court verdict had been duly paid. Some months ago Nhial Bol, the editor of the newspaper, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment (or the payment of a fine of about USD 2 000 ) for spreading false information in an article accusing the government of the President Omar el Bashir of involvement in the slave-trade in Sudan. Does the Council know about the repeated and systematic threats to freedom of expression on the part of the Sudanese authorities inherent in the state of emergency, which has been in force since 1999? What diplomatic pressure will it exert on the Sudanese authorities to ensure that the Khartoum Monitor reopens immediately? Does not the Council intend to make compliance with the agreement with the Khartoum government initialled on 10 December last year — which envisages the use of an initial fund designed for the technical preparation of cooperation programmes, which are to be resumed as soon as a definitive peace accord is initialled — dependent on the immediate lifting of the state of emergency?
