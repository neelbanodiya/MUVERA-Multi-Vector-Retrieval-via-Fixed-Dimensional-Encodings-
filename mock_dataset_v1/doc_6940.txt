Question for written answer E-006390/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Antolín Sánchez Presedo (S&D) (30 June 2011) Subject: Anti-competitive practices in the aluminium market The Wall Street Journal has published a series of investigations into anti-competitive practices on the commodities markets. The latest of these accuses a number of major investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan of manipulating aluminium prices to cause inflationary trends. The newspaper specifically reports that Goldman Sachs, through Metro International Trade Services, is accumulating aluminium in its warehouses, thereby obstructing its circulation in order to keep prices artificially high. In order to do so, it is alleged to be offering incentives to aluminium producers in return for their agreement to keep their production off the market for periods which can amount to over 10 months. In view of the fact that the main market trading in options and futures contracts on metals, the London Metal Exchange, is located in the EU, does the Commission have any data enabling it to corroborate this information? Has the Commission carried out, or does it intend to carry out, any investigation to assess the possible impact of these practices on European markets and to determine whether they are compatible with Community competition law?
