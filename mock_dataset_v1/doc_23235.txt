Adoption Decision Number of petitions Percentage Admissible 1,108 57.6 Inadmissible 812 42.2 Not recorded 4 0.2 Against this background, it should be reminded that Members have repeatedly called the attention on the so-called non-petitions, arguing that processing them is unnecessarily time consuming. Although no definition of a non-petition is available, a clear distinction should be made between such submissions and the petitions which are deemed inadmissible because they fall outside the scope of competences of the EU. Usually a non-petition can be described as a short personal statement or comment about EU policies or the way they should develop. For that matter, on the European Parliaments webpage dedicated to Petitions it is clearly indicated that requests for information are not dealt with by the Committee on Petitions, neither are general comments on EU policy. Furthermore, citizens are notified that petitions which contain offensive language or lack pertinence in their substance will not be investigated by the Committee, nor will they be given a reply. One can, therefore, only conclude that the Committee needs to put further emphasis on better explaining to citizens what petitioning the European Parliament means, and on improving the registration process within the European Parliament. Compared to 2008, few changes were registered in the top of the concerned countries: thus, the European Union as a whole continues to rank first, followed by Germany, Spain, Italy and Romania (the last two switched places as compared to 2008). Surprisingly, Malta finds itself at the bottom of the table, behind Slovenia and Latvia, as only nine petitions concerned this country in contrast with the twenty one received last year. 2009 Concerned country Number of petitions % European Union 403 18.6 Deutschland 298 13.8 España 279 12.9 Italia 176 8.1 Romania 143 6.6 Poland 100 4.6 Others 764 35.3 2008 Concerned country Number of petitions % European Union 330 15.9 Deutschland 265 12.8 España 226 10.9 Romania 207 10.0 Italia 184 8.9 Poland 105 5.1 United Kingdom 99 4.8 Greece 97 4.7 France 86 4.1 As already mentioned, environment remains the main field of concern for petitioners, followed by fundamental rights, justice and internal market, while property restitution related petitions decreased in number in year 2008. 2009 Themes Number of petitions Percentage Environment 228 9.7 Fundamental Rights 164 7.0 Justice 159 6.8 Internal Market 142 6.0 Property & Restitution 133 5.6 Employment 105 4.5 Health 104 4.4 Transport 101 4.3 Social
