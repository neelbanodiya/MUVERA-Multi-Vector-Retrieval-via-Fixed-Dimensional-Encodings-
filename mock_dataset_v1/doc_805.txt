Question for written answer E-010133/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Niccolò Rinaldi (ALDE) (6 December 2010) Subject: Possible restriction of press freedom following the EU‑China summit of 6 October 2010 On 6 October 2010, following the EU‑China Summit in Brussels, a press conference before a group of independent Chinese media, including The Epoch Times and New Tang Dynasty Television, was supposed to have been held. According to several newspapers, journalists from the two abovementioned newspapers were initially denied access to the conference. When they were later allowed in, the Chinese delegation apparently made sure the press conference was cancelled. 1. Is the Commission aware of the above events in the wake of the EU‑China summit? 2. Does it not agree that it should try to obtain more detailed information of this episode, in view of the current system of censorship in China and given that the incident took place at a European summit? 3. Does it not think that the position of the European delegation involved in this matter needs to be clarified?
