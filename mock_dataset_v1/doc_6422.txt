WRITTEN QUESTION P-3998/07 by Ivo Belet (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (25 July 2007) Subject: TEN-V priorities and implementation of the ‘Steel Rhine’ project The ‘Steel Rhine’ project is a trilateral agreement between Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands aimed at reactivating the railway line linking the port of Antwerp to Rheidt (Germany), passing through Dutch territory. Given the cross-border nature of this rail link and its crucial economic and environmental importance for the region (freight originating in the port of Antwerp will be directly carried to the German rail network, and thence to southern and eastern Europe, reducing road traffic), the project is one of the TEN-V ‘priority projects’. To date the project has not really got off the ground, given that the Belgian and Dutch authorities have been unable to reach agreement on, inter alia , the environmental and noise issues relating to the implementation of the project. The latter has not yet received any European funding. Last week Belgium and the Netherlands reached an agreement regarding the renovation of the ‘Steel Rhine’ line, stipulating inter alia that by 2030 at the latest, 72 international freight trains per day must be travelling along the line in both directions. Does the Commission intend to use this new momentum as an opportunity to relaunch the project and to have the work start as soon as possible using the subsidies committed under the TEN-V programme? When approximately can we expect this to happen? Under the new financial framework for 2007‑13, what percentage of the cost of the work to be done on a cross-border priority project such as the ‘Steel Rhine’ project can the Commission bear using, the funding provided for under TEN-V?
