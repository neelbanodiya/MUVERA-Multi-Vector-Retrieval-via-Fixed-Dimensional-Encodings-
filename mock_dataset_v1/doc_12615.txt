Question for written answer E-010290/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Teixeira (PPE) (11 November 2011) Subject: Tourism in the context of the future multiannual framework for 2014-2020: the case of the most remote regions Tourism is the main activity of the EU's most remote regions, contributing to the development of their economies and constituting a key sector for both their external trade and their economic growth. These regions have a specific status which justifies the differential treatment accorded to them under Article 349 of the Treaty and permitting the implementation of EU policies in adapted form within their territory, as well as specific conditions of access to the Structural Funds and Union programmes. On 30 June 2010 the Commission, in its communication entitled ‘Europe, the world's No 1 tourist destination — a new political framework for tourism in Europe’, launched an action plan aimed at boosting the competitiveness of Europe's tourist industry, and, in particular, ‘maximis[ing] the potential of EU financial policies and instruments for developing tourism’. Earlier, in its communication of 2008 ‘The Outermost Regions: an asset for Europe’, the Commission had expressed its commitment to supporting and encouraging initiatives aimed at promoting sectors with potential for economic development in the most remote regions, including the tourist industry. This was stressed by Commissioner Hahn in his answer to Written Question E‑4608/2010, tabled on 22 June 2010. The Commission's proposal of 6 October 2011 on a common strategic framework for the Structural Funds (COM(2011) 615) does not include tourism-related actions among the thematic objectives of cohesion policy for the period 2014 to 2020 listed in its Article 9, despite the fact that post-Lisbon the Union now has the power to support, coordinate and complement Member States' actions in the field of tourism policy (Article 195 TFEU). 1. Can the Commission specify in what ways tourist-sector activities can be supported in the context of the future multiannual financial framework, and indicate what plans it has for realising ‘the potential of EU financial policies and instruments’? 2. Can the Commission state what specific measures and programmes it has in mind for the most remote regions in this field of activity?
