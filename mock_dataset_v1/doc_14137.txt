be raised as regards the extent to which some of these measures are sufficient to protect the interests of employees and retired persons in the event of insolvency of the employer and that a number of issues need to be addressed; 55. Calls on the Commission to follow the implementation of this Directive closely, to take action against Member States where justified and, in any review of this Directive, to take account of the specific situation concerning the employer’s financing obligations vis-à-vis its employees or its pension fund; 56. Considers that there is a need to strengthen the EU legislation relating to employers’ insolvency in order to offer all workers equal protection of their savings regardless of the nature of their employer’s pension provision system; 57. Calls for an examination of whether pension insurance associations, such as those that exist in Luxembourg and Germany to protect the book reserve second pillar schemes, can be recommended to other Member States to protect the security mechanism; INFORMATION / PARTICIPATION AND INVESTMENT 58. Is concerned about the lack of information provided to the public by public authorities and bodies administering pensions with regard to requirements, options, possibilities, accumulated entitlements, likely returns and the actual state of affairs with regard to old-age pensions; stresses that citizens have to be provided with information regarding the actual costs and charges when concluding additional pension scheme contracts and with optimal information on the status of their pensions; stresses also the importance of sound financial education from an early stage; 59. Notes that there is a need for increased transparency and disclosure of fees levied on asset management and especially on all layers of investments by private pension providers; considers that the information provided to citizens from Member States and by funds concerning the accumulated entitlements should be integrated into an operational, transparent and accessible system at European level; 60. Considers that members of the public must be promptly and fully informed of the long-term consequences of any reform of pension provisions, particularly concerning the amount of their own pension and the total number of years of pension contributions due; notes that reforms must provide for an effective and smooth transitional regime; calls on the Member States to launch campaigns which enable and encourage citizens to inform themselves on the impact on their pension decisions as well as to ensure adequate pension provision for themselves; POLICY COORDINATION 61.
