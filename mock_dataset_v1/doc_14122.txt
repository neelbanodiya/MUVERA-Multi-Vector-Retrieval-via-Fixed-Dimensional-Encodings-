Joint answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-3917/07 , E-4042/07 (18 September 2007) It is up to Member States to decide whether their national strategic reference frameworks should cover the European territorial cooperation objective. Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK) are among those Member States that have opted for not including it. Priorities for territorial cooperation are addressed in the operational programmes under the territorial cooperation objective, in which the two Member States participate. Regrettably none of the two cross-border cooperation programmes between Ireland and the UK include cooperation between Dublin and Liverpool or between Dublin, Belfast and Glasgow. Nevertheless, this cooperation could take place within the framework of the transnational cooperation programmes ‘Atlantic Area’ and ‘North-West Europe’ or, provided an additional partner from a third country is included, within the interregional cooperation network programme ‘Interreg IVC’. These three operational programmes will be adopted by the Commission during September 2007.
