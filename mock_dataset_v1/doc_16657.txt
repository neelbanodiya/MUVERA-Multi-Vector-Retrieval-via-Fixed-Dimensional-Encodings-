Answer given by Mr Mandelson on behalf of the Commission (27 August 2007) As the Honourable Member rightly points out, the ‘Evaluation of the EC trade defence instruments (TDIs)’ prepared by Mayer, Brown, Rowe and Maw LLP concluded that the EU's TDIs are being used in a reasonable and adequate way. Over the years the EC has achieved this high standard in its practice by regularly reviewing and adapting its TDIs to the changing international and European economic environment. Since the last such major review took place over twelve years ago, it is clearly time to re-examine whether the EU has the right balance in its current practice, in light of the significant changes which have occured both in a global and European economic context, including the three successive waves of enlargement of the Community. The aim of this review is not to propose a major overhaul of the system. In fact, no unilateral revision or weakening of the efficacy of the EU's TDIs is foreseen. Rather, the aim is to draw up a pragmatic and balanced response to the views expressed during the consultations process. While these views diverge on some issues, it should be underlined that there is also an emerging consensus on a number of other issues.
