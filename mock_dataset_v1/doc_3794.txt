1999/C 348 E/206 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1056/99 by Daniela Raschhofer (NI) to the Commission (20 April 1999) Subject: Award of contracts The city of Vienna is the owner of some 220 000 homes. For decades these have been insured by the same insurance company, even though there has never been any call for tenders. 1. Should there be an invitation to tender, in accordance with relevant EU directives, for individual service and building contracts above the threshold value for homes owned directly or indirectly by the city of Vienna? If not, why not? 2. If so, what action will the Commission take to put an end to this state of affairs which is in violation of the Treaties?
