Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (17 December 2010) The Commission is aware of the potential of functional nano-materials for the fabrication of transparent thin-films and their possible use for absorbing light and generating electricity. The economic and environmental viability of using such materials under real-life exploitation conditions is however still to be demonstrated. Concerning relevant European research efforts, the Commission maintains long-term support for research, development and demonstration in the solar photovoltaic sector, providing a framework within which researchers and industrialists can work together to develop technology and applications. With the first four calls launched under the 7th Framework Programme for Research, more than EUR 116 million has already been invested in innovative projects on photovoltaics, including projects on organic solar cells and the use of nano-materials in photovoltaics. The call for proposals for the 2011 7th Framework Programme for Research, currently open for submission, has an increased budget available for renewable electricity production.
