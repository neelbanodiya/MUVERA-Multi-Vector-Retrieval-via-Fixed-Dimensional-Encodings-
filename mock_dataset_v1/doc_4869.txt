Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (27 June 2007) The Commission was informed about the presence of a population of Atractilis preuxiana plant species near to the industrial area adjacent to the future port of Granadilla. When adopting its opinion on this project, the Commission noted the intention of the national competent authorities to propose a new site of Community importance (SCI) including this Atractilis preuxiana plant population, as a compensatory measure. This plant species is listed in Annex II and IV of the 92/43/EEC Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . By designating this area as SCI, the national authorities are delivering the highest possible protection status under Community law. The assessment of the implications of a project on Sites of Community Importance has to be carried out following the provisions of Article 6.3 of the Habitats Directive. The above new SCI hosting populations of Atractilis preuxiana did not have to be considered in such an assessment, as the designation of the new site was a compensatory measure adopted pursuant to Article 6.4 of the Habitats Directive. The Commission is aware that the project of the Spanish authorities for constructing a new port in Granadilla has been modified during the planning process. The final project, for which the Commission has issued its opinion, pursuant to Article 6.4 of the Habitats Directive, foresees the construction of a smaller port than planned at prior stages, when the first environmental effects were assessed. This type of project is listed in Annex I of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, OJ L 175, 5.7.1985. as amended by Directive 97/11/EEC Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997 amending Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, OJ L 73, 14.3.1997. and Directive 2003/35/EEC Directive 2003/35/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice Council Directives 85/337/EEC
