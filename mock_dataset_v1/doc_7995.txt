Reply (2 October 2003) The Council is aware of the importance of young farmers to the Community's agriculture. Following the debate on the Commission proposals, the political agreement on the CAP reform package reached by the Council on 26 June 2003 provides, in Regulation (EC) No 1257/99 on support for rural development from the EAGGF, for the introduction of special measures for young farmers, in particular, greater support for investment purposes and increased aid to help them get started using advisory services related to their activities. It has also been agreed that the text of the regulation should specifically state that measures introduced for young farmers need to be more workable.
