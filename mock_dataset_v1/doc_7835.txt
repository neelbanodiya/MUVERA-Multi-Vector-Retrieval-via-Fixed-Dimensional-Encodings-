they are unable to obtain effective protection against such abuse because of their gender or social status as married women, daughters, widows or sisters, in that society. The Honourable Member is, however, advised that the Council has not yet adopted the above Directive. In Kenya, FGM was formally banned for girls under 17 after the Children's Act was adopted by the Parliament (2001). However, the Commission believes that confronting the complex and culturally entrenched beliefs that underlie FGM is an undertaking that must involve not only public repression, but also education and public awareness in the country. In this context the Commission has already brought up the question of women's rights with the Government of Kenya including FGM issues. The Commission is also assisting civil society initiatives with regard to women rights and women's involvement in political decision making while supporting a specific project focussing on FGM prevention in the Kisii district. The Commission will continue in the future to support adequate measures to ensure progress on women's rights and the eradication of FGM practices. In particular, the Union is proposing to reinforce political dialogue with the newly elected Kenyan Government focussing, inter alia, on human rights including gender issues. The Commission will also continue to bring up human rights issues, including gender issues, in the appropriate forums, including in the context of the Community-dialogue with Non-State Actors who monitor and enforce women's rights. For further details please refer to the Commission's answer given to Written Question E-0519/03 by Mrs Smet OJ C 33 E, 6.2.2004, p. 47 . regarding women's rights in Kenya.
