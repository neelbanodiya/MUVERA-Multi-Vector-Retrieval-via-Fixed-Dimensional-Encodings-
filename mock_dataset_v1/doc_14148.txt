an examination of whether pension insurance associations, such as those that exist in Luxembourg and Germany to protect the second pillar in the event of bankruptcy, can be recommended to other Member States as a hedging mechanism and best practice; 25. Considers that, in view of the widely differing nature and the complexity of second-pillar schemes, basic conditions could be laid down to govern the EU-wide transferability of employee-financed occupational pensions; IORP DIRECTIVE 26. Observes that the implementation of the IORP Directive by Member States generally has been delayed; calls on the Commission, if necessary, to take action against Member States in order to ensure correct and timely implementation of the IORP Directive; 27. Agrees that a high degree of security for future pensioners, at a reasonable cost for the sponsoring undertakings and in the context of sustainable pension systems, should be the goal; 28. Notes that Article 15(6) of the IORP Directive states, with regard to the calculation of technical provisions, that ‘the Commission shall propose any necessary measures to prevent possible distortions caused by different levels of interest rates and to protect the interest of beneficiaries and members of any scheme’; 29. Points to the fact that workers who move across borders in the EU still suffer major disadvantages as regards supplementary pension schemes, since their occupational pensions may be fragmented and they may lose tax and social security benefits related to national occupational schemes; 30. Recalls the statements in the IORP Directive that ‘a genuine internal market for financial services is crucial for economic growth and job creation in the Community’ and that ‘this Directive thus represents a first step on the way to an internal market for occupational retirement provision organised on a European scale’; 31. Calls on the Commission to carry out an impact assessment before revising the IORP Directive and to take account of the trend towards more defined-contribution schemes and fewer defined-benefit schemes; MOBILITY AND TRANSFERS 32. Stresses that free movement of persons is a fundamental right of European citizens; stresses the growing importance of labour-market mobility in the European Union, as well as the need for such mobility; considers that any adverse impact of labour mobility on individual pension entitlements must be kept to a minimum; observes that Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems regulates mobility for the first pillar; notes that no such framework yet exists
