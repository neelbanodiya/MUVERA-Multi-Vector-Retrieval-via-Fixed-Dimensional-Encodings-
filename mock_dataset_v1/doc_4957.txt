WRITTEN QUESTION E-2083/10 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) to the Commission (7 April 2010) Subject: Agreement between the EU and Morocco on trade in agricultural goods On 17 December 2009 the Commission and the Moroccan authorities signed agreed minutes marking the conclusion of negotiations towards better conditions for bilateral trade in products from the agri-food and fisheries sectors. As we all know, the EU’s Mediterranean countries produce many similar products over the same periods of time. What is more, European producers must comply with inter alia strict product safety and quality standards. Prior to signing the aforementioned statement, did the Commission properly assess how greater opening up of the EU market, under the provisions of the agreement, would affect European agriculture, particularly certain sensitive sectors such as fruit and vegetables? Exports of which EU agricultural products are expected to be boosted as a result of greater access to the Moroccan market? Is the agreement expected to entail increased protection for products’ geographical indications? Are provisions on compliance with sanitary, phytosanitary and quality standards expected to be included? Can the Commission confirm that in recent years Moroccan tomato imports have exceeded the quotas set in the agreement in force?
