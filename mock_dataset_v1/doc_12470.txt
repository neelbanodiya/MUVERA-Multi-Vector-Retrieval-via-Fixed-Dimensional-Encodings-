European Parliament of 15 December 2004 . , Whereas: (1) Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables OJ L 340, 9.12.1976, p. 26. Directive as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/ 2003 (OJ L 122, 16.5.2003, p. 36). , Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals OJ L 221, 7.8.1986, p. 37. Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 2004/61/ EC (OJ L 127, 29.4.2004, p. 81). , Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin OJ L 221, 7.8.1986, p. 43. Directive as last amended by Directive 2004/61/EC. , and Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables OJ L 350, 14.12.1990, p. 71. Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 2004/ 95 /EC (OJ L 301, 28.9.2004, p. 42) . , have been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and simplicity, those Directives should be repealed and replaced by a single act. (2) This Regulation directly concerns public health and is relevant to the functioning of the internal market. Differences in national maximum residue levels for pesticides can pose barriers to trade in products included in Annex I to the Treaty and products derived therefrom between Member States and trade between third countries and the Community. Accordingly, in the interest of free movement of goods, equal competition conditions among the Member States, as well as a high level of consumer protection, it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) for products of plant and animal origin be set at Community level, taking into account good agricultural practice . (3) A Regulation establishing MRLs does not require transposition into national law in the Member States. It is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument with which to set MRLs for pesticides in products of plant and animal origin, as its precise requirements are to be applied at the same time and in the same manner throughout the Community and accordingly permit a more efficient use of national resources. (4) The production and consumption of plant and animal products play a very important role
