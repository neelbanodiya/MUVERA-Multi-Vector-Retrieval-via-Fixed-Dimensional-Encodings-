9999/C Q999 E/006 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0727/04 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (27 February 2004) Subject: Information on the performance reserve for the Lazio Region Community regulations on the use of the Structural Funds (Article 7(5) of Regulation (EC) 1260/1999 OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1 . ) provide for 4 % of the total resources of the Community support framework for 2000-2006 to be set aside for mid-term payment on the basis of the performance — in terms of the effectiveness of the form of assistance, proper management and financial implementation — of the regional and central authorities receiving funding. This form of premium, referred to in Italy precisely as a reward and accompanied by an extra payment by the Italian Treasury, would appear to have been granted recently to the Lazio Region in recognition of its outstanding achievements under Docup Objective 2, with EUR 314 million being committed to the region, of which over EUR 290 million was provided by European funding, and 1 527 projects funded in addition to investments totalling EUR 403 800 000 and the designation of five industrial zones and three production zones as excellent (source: www.tesoro.it). 1. In view of the above, can the Commission state how much has been paid by the EU to the Lazio Region pursuant to Article 7(5) of the above Regulation? 2. Which other Italian and European regions have been recognised in this way and how much of the 4 % set aside have they received? 3. Is it planned that a general report be published on the payment of the 4 % set aside to the various European authorities rewarded in this way?
