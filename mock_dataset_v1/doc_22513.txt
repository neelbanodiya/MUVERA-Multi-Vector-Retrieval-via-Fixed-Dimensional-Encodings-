Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 98/26/EC on settlement finality in payment and securities settlement systems and Directive 2002/47/EC on financial collateral arrangements as regards linked systems and credit claims ( COM(2008)0213 – C6‑0181/2008 – 2008/0082(COD) ) (Codecision procedure: first reading) The European Parliament , – having regard to the Commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council ( COM(2008)0213 ), – having regard to Article 251(2) and Article 95 of the EC Treaty, pursuant to which the Commission submitted the proposal to Parliament ( C6‑0181/2008 ), – having regard to Rule 51 of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs ( A6‑0480/2008 ), 1. Approves the Commission proposal as amended; 2. Calls on the Commission to refer the matter to Parliament again if it intends to amend the proposal substantially or replace it with another text; 3. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and Commission. Amendment 1 Proposal for a directive – amending act Article 1 – point -1 (new) Directive 98/26/EC Recital 8 Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (-1) Recital 8 is deleted. Justification The 1998 SFD explicitly allowed Member States to notify systems that were active in commodity derivatives. This explicit reference was necessary as commodity derivatives were not covered by the 1993 Investment Services Directive. Since then, MiFID has replaced the ISD and commodity derivatives are fully covered. Preamble 8 of the SFD has therefore lost its relevance and is therefore deleted. Amendment 2 Proposal for a directive – amending act Article 1 – point -1 a (new) Directive 98/26/EC Recital 14 a (new) Text proposed by the Commission Amendment (-1a) The following recital is inserted: " ( 14a ) Whereas in case of interoperable systems, a lack of coordination in regard to the rules applicable at the moment of entry/irrevocability may expose participants in one system, or even the system operator itself, to the spill-over effects of a default in another system. In order to limit systemic risk, it is desirable to ensure that system operators of interoperable systems coordinate the rules on the moment of entry/irrevocability in the systems that they operate." Justification Coordination of entry/irrevocability times is necessary in order to limit systemic risks and to avoid ex-post legal disputes. Amendment 3 Proposal for a directive
