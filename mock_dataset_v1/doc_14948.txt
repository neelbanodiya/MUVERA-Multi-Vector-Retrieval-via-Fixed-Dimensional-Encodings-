WRITTEN QUESTION E-5012/08 by Brian Simpson (PSE) to the Commission (22 September 2008) Subject: Non-respect of Community rules on the maximum dimensions of road vehicles Directive 96/53/EC OJ L 235, 17.9.1996, p. 59. , as amended by Directive 2002/7/EC OJ L 67, 9.3.2002, p. 47. , lays down the maximum permitted dimensions of road vehicles circulating on the roads in the European Union. Article 4(5) of the directive allows for trials of vehicles with larger dimensions for trial periods. Article 4(6) of the directive allowed a ten-year transition period until 31 December 2006 for existing equipment that exceeded the maximum dimensions to continue circulating on national territory. Directive 96/53/EC did not allow articulated lorries to transport by road 45-foot containers, other than under the conditions laid down in Article 4(6). Nonetheless, it appears that the Commission has taken a policy decision to allow the transport by road of 45-foot containers beyond the 31 December 2006 limit. In addition, Mercedes Benz is now marketing a new model of articulated bus called the CapaCity which is 19.5 m long. This is some 75 cm longer than the limit of 18.75 m permitted by the directive. The CapaCity is not a prototype since fleet orders are now being taken for it. 1. Can the Commission confirm that it took a policy decision to prolong the carriage of 45-foot containers by road after 31 December 2006? If yes, could the Commission explain how it has changed the contents of a directive of the European Parliament and Council without amending the legislation? 2. How can the Commission explain its decision to those shipping lines and hauliers that changed away from using 45-foot containers in order to respect the EC directive? 3. Can the Commission confirm that 45-foot containers are used primarily by one shipping line — Maersk? How does the Commission explain the distortion of competition in favour of Maersk? 4. What does the Commission intend to do as regards the bus design that exceeds the EU rules by 75 cm? 5. If the Commission does allow articulated buses to exceed the rules on maximum length by 75 cm then does it not agree that there is a risk that lorries will also become 75 cm longer? 6. In general, does the Commission agree that the length of road vehicles has a significant effect on road safety? In particular, does it agree that containers that
