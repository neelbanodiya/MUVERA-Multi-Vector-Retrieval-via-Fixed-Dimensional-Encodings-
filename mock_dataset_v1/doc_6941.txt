Joint answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-5139/09 , E-5159/09 (20 November 2009) The Commission wishes to thank the Parliament for its support to the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being as expressed in the Parliament Resolution on Mental Health of 19 February 2009. The action points included in the Resolution support the Commission in its activities to implement the Pact and in particular in the organisation of the series of five thematic conferences, which are organised in cooperation with Member States. In line with the Parliament's expectations reflected in the Resolution, the Commission has taken steps to work closely with the Member States and to ensure input from other relevant Community policy areas, such as social and research policies, in this endeavour, including in the preparation of the thematic conferences. The second thematic conference will take place on 10 and 11 December 2009 on the theme of ‘Prevention of Depression and Suicide in a Time of Crisis — Making it happen’. The conference will be organised jointly with the Ministry of Health of Hungary, and it will be supported by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Europe and the Swedish Presidency of the EU. The relevant action points highlighted in the Parliament's Resolution are being integrated into the conference preparation and documentation. The conference is expected to highlight possibilities for evidence-based action to prevent suicide. Recommendations will build on the WHO/EU Conference on Mental Health and Suicidal Behaviour in times of Economic Crisis: what does research show and how to counteract the negative impact on mental health, which took place in Stockholm on 14-15 October 2009 and on projects co-funded from EU Health Programmes, such as the ‘European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD)’ http://www.eaad.net/ , and projects funded from the 7th Framework Programme for Research, such as the ‘OSPI-Europe’ project http://www.ospi-europe.com/en/project-impact.php or ‘Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE)’ ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/fp7/docs/eu-fp7-public-health-projects_en.pdf , or MOODINFLAME http://www.moodinflame.nl , a EUR 12 million project on early diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mood disorders. In order to support the implementation of the Pact, the Commission is developing a new web-based tool, the EU Compass for Action on Mental Health and Well-being http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_determinants/life_style/mental/mental_health_compass_en.htm . The Compass is a tool for the exchange of information on mental health issues and activities across the EU. It comprises a database of policies and good practices identified in Member
