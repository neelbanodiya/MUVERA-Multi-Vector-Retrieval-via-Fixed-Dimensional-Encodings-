accusation dated 18 February 2004 and submitted to the Central District Court of Buda on 23 February 2004; whereas the Central District Court of Buda gave its judgment on 28 June 2005, which was then appealed against in the Budapest Municipal Court and annulled by that Court on 3 February 2006, D. whereas as a result the case was referred back to the Central District Court of Buda, which acquitted Ágnes Hankiss of the charges on 6 February 2009; whereas an appeal was brought by the plaintiff against this judgment in the Budapest Municipal Court, which on 25 March 2009 decided to uphold the judgment of the District Court on all its grounds, E. whereas on 12 November 2009 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Hungary annulled both judgments on the grounds of breach of substantive law and instructed the Central District Court of Buda to conduct new proceedings, F. whereas Ágnes Hankiss has been a Member of the Parliament since 15 July 2009, G. whereas, according to Article 9 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, during the sessions of the Parliament its Members enjoy in the territory of their own State the immunities accorded to members of its parliament; and whereas this does not prevent the Parliament from exercising its right to waive the immunity of one of its Members, H. whereas Section 552(1) of the Hungarian Act on Criminal Proceedings requires that criminal proceedings against a person enjoying immunity be suspended and a waiver of such immunity requested, and whereas Section 551(1) of that Act provides that criminal proceedings may only be initiated against, inter alia, a Member of the European Parliament after the suspension of immunity, I. whereas Section 12(1) of Act LVII of 2004 provides that a request for waiver of immunity in cases subject to private action is to be made by the court to the President of Parliament, J. whereas in the new proceedings following the annulment Ágnes Hankiss stated that she is a Member of the Parliament and in consequence the Central District Court of Buda, acting on the basis of Section 552(1) of the Hungarian Act on Criminal Proceedings and Section 12 of Act LVII of 2004, decided to suspend the proceedings and ask for the waiver of immunity, K. whereas it is therefore appropriate to recommend that parliamentary immunity be waived in this instance,
