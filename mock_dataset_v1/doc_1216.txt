Takes the view that the Convention would have been greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a single, efficient dispute-settlement mechanism that would make for speedy and satisfactory resolution of disputes concerning the origin and the cumulation of products; invites the Commission to assess the possibility of integrating such a mechanism into the Convention when it is revised in the future; 8.
