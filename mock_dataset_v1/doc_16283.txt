Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (11 December 2009) In order to assess the need for a statute for a European Foundation, the Directorate-General Internal Market and Services carried out a public consultation between February 2009 and May 2009. The objective of the consultation was to get feedback on the feasibility study itself and on the need for a European Foundation Statute, and to get more in-depth information on the operational problems that foundations face when operating cross-border. The consultation forms part of an assessment on the need for and impact of possible EU action in this field. Political decisions on the possible actions will, however, only be taken by the next Commission.
