Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (29 March 2011) As the Honourable Member is rightly informed, the European sugar market is currently witnessing a rather tight supply situation. In 2010 world market sugar prices (550‑600 EUR/t) have frequently exceeded the average EU sugar price which moved in the range of 474‑486 EUR/t. As a consequence some of the forecasted imports into the EU have been possibly diverted. In order to improve the sugar supply the Commission has taken the following steps: — As from 1 December 2010 the 98 EUR/t import duty was suspended on the CXL import quotas until 31 August 2011 Commission Regulation (EU) 1100/2010, OJ L 312, 27.11.2010, p. 14-15. . This measure, from which mainly benefited the full-time refiners, ensured that these quotas would be fully utilized. — More recently, to permit the immediate release of 500 000 tonnes of out-of-quota sugar and 26 000 tonnes of out-of-quota isoglucose on the internal market without the payment of any surplus levy Commission Regulation (EU) 222/2011, OJ L 60, 5.3.2011, p. 6-9. . This measure became effective in March 2011, and — to open a duty-free import tariff quota for 300 000 tonnes of sugar from all origins. This measure is expected to apply as from April 2011. In case the market situation would justify so the Commission could consider the opening of additional import tariff quotas. This package provides an efficient and timely response from the Commission to the supply tightness on the EU sugar market by on the one hand mobilising the existing stocks of sugar and, on the other, facilitating imports. In the view of the Commission, all sugar operators in the EU have a role to play in restablishing the appropriate levels of supply in the domestic market. This includes full-time reffiners that would have access to additional quantities of sugar through the new import quota. The Commission can agree that the full-time refiners are well placed to benefit the opening of the import TRQ but, in a situation of sugar undersupply where the prioirty is to re-establish the balance of the market, sees no justification for granting exclusive access to only certain types of operators. The Commission is confident that the above measures will largely solve the supply problem. However, in case the market situation justifies so the opening of additional TRQs could be considered.
