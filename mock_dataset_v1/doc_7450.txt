Question for written answer E-8382/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (15 October 2010) Subject: Alarming increase in the number of illegal immigrants entering Greece There has been an alarming increase in the number of illegal immigrants entering Greece via its northern borders. Frontex, which has an impressive record in restricting flows of illegal immigrants across Greece's north-eastern maritime borders, has been less successful on Greece's northern land borders. Thousands of illegal immigrants are now entering Greece across this border, creating as new flashpoint. To illustrate this point: while in one year arrests in Orestiada have increased by 640 %, arrests on the islands have fallen by 80 %. In the region of Nea Byssa, Turkish soldiers disappear from their sentry posts on their side of the border whenever the Greek authorities locate persons crossing the border. And when Frontex personnel working in the area locate Iranian, Iraqi or Syrian citizens and send them back to Turkey because they come from a neighbouring country, Turkey sends them back again to Greece on the pretext that they have not been identified by the consular authorities of third countries in Turkey. These people are thus passed to and fro until they finally end up on Greek hands. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Does it intend to examine the possibility of setting up a Frontex office on the other side of the border in Turkey? 2. Given that Turkey is lavishly funded by the EU to tackle the immigrant problem, how does it intend to control the problem of illegal immigration which is a European problem with social and economic repercussions?
