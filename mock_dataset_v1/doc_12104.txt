by the Member States. The Agency may undertake inspections of public authorities and private operators in the Member States. For this purpose it may, in compliance with the legal provisions of the Member State concerned, 1. Without prejudice to the enforcement powers conferred by the Treaty on the Commission, the Agency shall assist the Commission for the purpose of evaluating and controlling the application of the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy by the Member States. The Agency may , using its own resources, undertake inspections of public authorities and private operators in the Member States. For this purpose it may, in compliance with the legal provisions of the Member State concerned, Justification The Agency should, at a future date, have its own resources, such as well equipped vessels, in order to undertake the inspections which the Regulation empowers it to carry out. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT Effective and non-discriminatory implementation of the rules must be one of the fundamental pillars of the Common Fisheries Policy. Respect for the rules and a coherent approach to control is the best way to protect the interests of the fishing sector in the long term. If those involved in fisheries, from the people on the boats to those who sell the fish to consumers, do not respect the rules, the Policy is doomed to fail. Fish stocks will disappear, along with those who depend upon them. Both the Commission and the European Parliament have repeatedly regretted the poor level of compliance and called for better controls by Member States, harmonized inspection criteria and penalties, transparency of the results of inspections, strengthening the system of Community inspections, etc. For instance see the EP resolutions of 06.09.2006 ( A6-0228/2006 , Morillon), of 23.10.2003 ( A5-0331/2003 , Figueiredo), of 04.07.2002 ( A5-0228/2002 ,Attwooll), of 17.01.2002 ( A5-0470/2001 , Miguelez Ramos) and of 06.11.1997 ( A4-0298/1997 , Fraga Estevez). The rules are agreed at the EU level but implementation and enforcement are the responsibility of the Member States, so there are several possible reasons for a failure to properly apply them. The first is juridical, in the sense that the control regulation and related instruments are insufficient, and do not provide the proper legal authority for inspectors to do their jobs. Another is political - do the Member States fulfil their legal obligations to fully implement the rules they have agreed to at Council and allocate sufficient resources to
