Question for written answer E-8079/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Zigmantas Balčytis (S&D) (11 October 2010) Subject: Granting more power to the ESRB The economic and financial crisis highlighted shortcomings in financial management and the coordination of EU economic policy. The political vision set out in the EU2020 strategy is basically one of economic recovery, restoring stability in public finances, sustainable economic growth and job creation. In order to achieve these objectives, the European Union needs to enforce stricter macroeconomic supervision which covers all relevant economic policies. The first steps have already been taken with the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the appropriate authorities responsible for micro-supervision. These authorities, however, only have the power of recommendation. The European Commission is now talking about the possibility of imposing sanctions on Member States that do not respect the Stability and Growth Pact criteria, but makes no mention of applying sanctions on financial institutions such as commercial banks, despite the fact that the three new authorities will monitor various financial sectors that have a particular influence on Member States’ fiscal policies. Does the Commission not consider, in this respect, that the ESRB should be given greater powers, so that it can not just issue reports that serve as recommendations, but also, where necessary, impose appropriate penalties on financial institutions in the Member States that do not comply with the rules?
