Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (8 June 2007) The Commission does not have exact figures on the number of haemophiliac persons in each Member State that have developed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or Hepatitis C from contaminated blood transfusion and blood products, are terminally ill or have died from these diseases. The Commission does not have a dedicated statistical tool to measure the prevalence of this specific combination ‘disease — route of transmission’. However, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Centre for the Epidemiological Monitoring of AIDS www.eurohiv.org provided the Commission with information on the situation of haemophiliacs infected with HIV/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) in the EU as of December 2005. In the Member States, a cumulative total of 3 621 haemophiliacs were reported as declared AIDS cases since the 1980's, among whom 2 844 were known to have died. There is currently no centralised European database on Hepatitis C infection among haemophiliacs. The European Haemophilia Consortium www.EHC.eu , an independent association which represents the European patients with haemophilia, also has gathered certain information on haemophiliac persons contaminated with HIV and Hepatitis C through blood transfusion and blood products.
