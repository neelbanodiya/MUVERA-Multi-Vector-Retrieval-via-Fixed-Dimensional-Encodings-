WRITTEN QUESTION E-5536/09 by Sergio Berlato (PPE) to the Commission (10 November 2009) Subject: Unlawful disposal of radioactive material On 12 September 2009, at 17.45, a ship carrying Arpacal experts (Arpacal being the Calabrian regional environmental protection agency) discovered the sunken wreck of a merchant vessel lying 487 metres deep off the Tyrrhenian coast of Calabria; on board there were a large number of drums whose contents were suspect. The subsequent investigation revealed that criminal organisations had been trafficking in radioactive material in order to dispose of it illegally on merchant vessels scuttled in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Calabrian judges have said that it is essential to shed light on other suspect sinkings that have occurred over the years off the same stretch of coast. The news has alarmed the public and local institutions, given the obvious risks posed not just to public health and the cleanliness of the environment, but also to the economy of the tourism and fisheries sectors and, more generally, to the regional economy as a whole. In the light of the foregoing, 1. Does the Commission believe that appropriate epidemiological research should be launched, focusing in particular on areas where toxic or radioactive vessels have been and/or are said to have been sunk, in order to establish whether there are significant links between such diseases as might be found to exist and what is feared to be a ships’ graveyard? Does it not consider that the ultimate aim should be to apply efficacious treatments at the right time? 2. How will the Commission protect the safety of the Tyrrhenian coast and what further steps will it take in order to pave the way for a possible coastal clean-up operation?
