Question for written answer E-7375/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Marietje Schaake (ALDE) (16 September 2010) Subject: Iran — dual nationality Does the Commission know how many citizens of EU Member States also have Iranian nationality? Can it provide figures? Is the Commission aware of the fact that the Iranian authorities do not recognise any European nationality as a second citizenship or nationality in addition to the Iranian one, even in the case of individuals who have acquired a European nationality after coming to an EU Member State as refugees? Is the Commission aware that this non-recognition also means that Iranian-European citizens in Iran are not recognised as having access to consular assistance and are considered as Iranian only, even if these individuals came to an EU Member State as refugees? Is the Commission aware that a number of EU‑Iranian citizens are imprisoned in Iran (the recent case of Dutch-Iranian citizen Zahra Bahrami being one example)? Can it provide figures? Will the Commission tackle this issue at EU level with the Iranian authorities — particularly in the light of the establishment of the European External Action Service? If not, why not? Does the Commission agree that the issue poses a serious challenge to EU‑Iranian relations, which are already difficult? If not, why not? Does the Commission believe it is responsible for addressing the issue of dual EU‑Iranian citizenship collectively? If not, why not? What practical steps will the Commission take to ensure it can live up to its responsibility of providing for the wellbeing of all its citizens, including dual nationals with an Iranian passport?
