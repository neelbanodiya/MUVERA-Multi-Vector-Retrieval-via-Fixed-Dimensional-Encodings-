WRITTEN QUESTION E-5534/07 by Paulo Casaca (PSE) to the Commission (13 November 2007) Subject: The Treaty of Lisbon and the death penalty Public opinion in Portugal has recently expressed concern over reports that the Treaty of Lisbon as it stands could reintroduce the death penalty in certain circumstances. Examination of the issue suggests that this misunderstanding has arisen from a declaration from the Convention which gave rise to the second Treaty of Rome, which has no legal value and claims to be an ‘explanatory note’, but which makes assertions which were totally incorrect at the time and are substantively and politically unacceptable. Despite the fact that the treaty is the responsibility of the contracting parties, not of the Commission, can the Commission nonetheless — given that it was an integral part of the previous European Convention, and recalling that numerous European citizens (including the author of this question) have deposited their faith in the Commission as the authentic ‘guardian of the Treaties’ — state what follow-up it has undertaken on this point, and how it happened that it allowed such a misunderstanding to arise?
