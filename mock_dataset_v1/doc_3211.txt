ORAL QUESTION H-0118/10 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Justas Vincas Paleckis to the Commission Subject: Electronic voting During the 2009 European Parliament elections, Estonia was the only country in the European Union whose citizens were able to vote via the internet. According to expert data, electronic voting could make elections more effective and ensure greater citizen participation. Electronic voting would also attract younger voters, who are usually passive and indifferent. Electronic voting, with reliable systems and clear instructions for voters, would strengthen democracy and create more comfortable conditions for voting both for disabled people and for citizens who travel constantly. Has the Commission drawn up recommendations to the Member States on the introduction of electronic voting? Has it examined the possibilities for preparing the necessary measures and funding for Member States to introduce the option of electronic voting in the Member States by the 2014 European Parliament elections?
