Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2008) In the framework of the Inter-Institutional Group on Information (IGI), Parliament, Commission and Council identify yearly a number of common communication priorities. The European elections have been identified as one of the key interinstitutional communication priorities for 2009. The Commission is working closely with Parliament, both centrally and in the offices and Representations in Member States, to ensure that the Commission's work in this area complements and strengthens the Parliament campaign. However, the contract with Scholz & Friends referred to in the question has been signed by Parliament and therefore it would be more appropriate to address this question to their relevant services.
