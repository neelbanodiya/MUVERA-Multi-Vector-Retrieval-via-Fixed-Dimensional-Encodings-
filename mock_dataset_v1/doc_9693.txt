Question for written answer E-007271/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jens Rohde (ALDE) (22 July 2011) Subject: Industrial and enterprise policy In its response of 21 March to Question No E‑003020/2011, the Commission confirmed its commitment to creating a high-level group on business services, as described in the communication on an integrated industrial policy and the Single Market Act. I call on the Commission to explain what progress has been made in appointing the group’s members and what specific action it has taken since March. Can the Commission state which Directorates-General will take part in this and by which MEP(s) the group will be chaired? Has the Commission taken any more decisions on which sectors of industry will be involved? Will Parliament be invited to participate in the activities of the high-level group?
