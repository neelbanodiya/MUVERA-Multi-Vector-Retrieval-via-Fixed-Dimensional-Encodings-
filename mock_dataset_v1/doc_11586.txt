is inhibited on the OD, burning only on the 2 outer ends and the central bore, and is dimensioned so the burning area does not change significantly (< 3% in the original BATES motor) through the burn, generating a flat-topped thrust curve (neutral burn) to minimize propellant characterization costs and simplify the data analysis." ] ], [ "Rocket engine", [ "A rocket engine is a type of jet engine that uses only stored rocket propellant mass for forming its high-speed propulsive jet.", " Rocket engines are reaction engines, obtaining thrust in accordance with Newton's third law.", " Most rocket engines are internal combustion engines, although non-combusting forms (such as cold gas thrusters) also exist.", " Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets.", " Since they need no external material to form their jet, rocket engines can perform in a vacuum and thus can be used to propel spacecraft and ballistic missiles." ] ], [ "Able (rocket stage)", [ "Able rocket stage was a rocket stage manufactured in the United States by Aerojet for the Vanguard rockets used in the Vanguard project from 1957 to 1959.", " The rocket engine stage use as a rocket propellant Nitric acid and UDMH.", " Able rocket stage was the second of three stages on the multistage rocket Vanguard.", " The Able rocket stage was discontinued in 1960.", " A further improved versions were used in the upper stage in the Thor rocket family (Thor-Able).", " An upgrade to the Able Stage was the Thor-Ablestar rocket.", " The Ablestar second stage was an enlarged version of the Able rocket stage, which gave the Thor-Ablestar a greater payload capacity compared to the Thor-Able.", " It also incorporated restart capabilities, allowing a multiple-burn trajectory to be flown, further increasing payload, or allowing the rocket to reach different orbits.", " It was the first rocket to be developed with such a capability and development of the stage took a mere eight months." ] ], [ "Asteroid mining", [ "Asteroid mining is the exploitation of raw materials from asteroids and other minor planets, including near-Earth objects. Minerals and volatiles could be mined from an asteroid or spent comet then used in space for in-situ utilization (e.g. construction materials and rocket propellant) or taken back to Earth.", " These include gold, iridium, silver, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium and tungsten for transport back to Earth; iron, cobalt,
