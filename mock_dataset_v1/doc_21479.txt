WRITTEN QUESTION E-3807/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 October 2005) Subject: Progress with implementation of the mental health programme According to reports in the Greek press, there are severe problems associated with the implementation of the Community co-funded ‘Psychargo’ project. This fact appears to be corroborated by the seventh monitoring committee, which reports the appropriation take-up rate to be 20 % for Section 2 of the operational programme on mental health. Can the Commission provide a detailed table showing what stage has been reached to date in implementing the individual projects/actions under the operational programme on mental health (legal commitments, payments)? Which projects are furthest behind schedule? What are the causes of the delays? What measures should the Greek Government take to ensure that the ‘Psychargo’ project is smoothly implemented?
