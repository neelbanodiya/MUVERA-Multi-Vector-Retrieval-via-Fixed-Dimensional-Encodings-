Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (8 July 2011) The Commission is currently analysing pending applications in line with the assessment procedures in place under the present legislation. As regards low level presence of non‑authorised genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the Commission is monitoring the situation in the food sector to identify whether action would be needed. In the case of seeds, no decision has been taken yet on whether action would be needed to harmonise the implementation of the legislation. The various parameters of GM labelling have been considered in the evaluation of the GM food and feed legislation, which findings will be published in the coming months. It is, however, worth to underline that the current rules already provide for compulsory labelling of all food containing, consisting of or produced from GMOs thereby ensuring consumer choice. The Commission is committed to address the concerns of the European citizens on GM food. In the past months several processes were initiated to enhance the dialogue with citizens on the evaluation of GMOs. Notably, an open debate with the stakeholders and civil society on risk assessment and management of GMOs was organised by the Commission on 17 March 2010 (other open debates will follow in the coming months). In addition, after a thorough public consultation process, EFSA published in May 2011 new guidelines on food/feed risk assessment. Furthermore the Honourable Member is kindly invited to refer to the Commission's reply to written question No E‑004782/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp which addresses the independence of EFSA (including the selection of experts). As regards the question on the liability of GMO producers and users, GMO legislation is already taken into consideration in the environmental liability provisions with reference to Directive 2001/18/EC Directive 2001/18/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC — Commission Declaration, OJ L 106, 17.4.2001. in Annex III of Directive 2004/35/EC Directive 2004/35/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, OJ L 143, 30.4.2004. on environmental liability. The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑03595/20111 .
