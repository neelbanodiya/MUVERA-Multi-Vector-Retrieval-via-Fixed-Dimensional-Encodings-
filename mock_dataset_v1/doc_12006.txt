WRITTEN QUESTION E-0696/08 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (14 February 2008) Subject: European passport Many Community citizens leave their own countries and go and live in other Community countries for all sorts of reasons, in a straightforward exercise of the right which they have acquired, thanks to the EU, to go and live in any Member State without further ado. However, in their host countries, the authorities very frequently have absolutely no knowledge of the personal details of the new Community citizens who have come to live in their country. At present, information regarding personal, legal, medical and cultural background, etc. is recorded in a vast array of documents of all kinds, which is anything but easy for the European citizens in question and their host countries and the authorities there to deal with. Does the Commission believe that they should be promoting a single Community document, which would contain full personal details, details of assets, medical history, cultural background, etc., so that a single document, i.e. a kind of ‘European passport’, would facilitate the movement of all Community citizens living outwith their nations of origin, and identify their place of residence (both personal and legal)?
