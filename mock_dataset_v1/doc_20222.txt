Question for written answer E-004829/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (19 May 2011) Subject: Anti-terrorist legislation in Turkey According to the International Press Institute (IPI), anti-terrorist legislation in Turkey is undermining freedom of speech and expression and preventing journalists from doing their job properly, since they are in danger of facing conspiracy charges as a result of their investigations. Attempts by journalists' organisations to persuade the Turkish Government to amend the law have been unsuccessful. In view of this: Does the Commission intend to call on the Turkish authorities to amend the law and bring it into with European legislation?
