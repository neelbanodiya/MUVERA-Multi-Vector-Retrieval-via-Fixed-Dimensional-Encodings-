WRITTEN QUESTION E-0070/10 by Diogo Feio (PPE) to the Commission (21 January 2010) Subject: Fees charged by Portuguese banks on international transfers: possible violation of consumer rights Portuguese consumers have recently informed me that the fees charged by some Portuguese banks on international transfers are significantly higher where the person making the transfer chooses to bear all the charges rather than sharing them with the beneficiary, in which case the charges are considerably lower. Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Is it aware of banking practices of this kind? 2. Does it consider it appropriate that the level of fees for international transfers paid by the person making the transfer should vary in this way, penalising them significantly more heavily where they choose to bear all the charges for the operation? 3. Can the Commission verify whether this practice is widespread in Portugal, whether it conforms to the rules of free and fair competition, and whether consumer rights are being respected?
