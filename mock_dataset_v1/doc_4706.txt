period not only hindered the necessary adaptation but created unequal conditions for competition on the internal market as well, which many operators were economically unable to cope with; 16. Stresses the important role of the rural development programmes both in establishing a new, market-oriented approach for farms – e.g. in processing and marketing their own products or in tourism – and in creating alternative sources of income for those who abandon basic agricultural production for economic reasons; 17. Notes that the different levels of the direct payments between the EU-10 and EU-15 have not ensured a level playing field, thus in several new Member States the producers lost ground even on their domestic markets, a situation to which, primarily, competition resulting from an increase in imports and exports from third countries due to the changed customs regime also contributed; 18. Notes that the Commission's reservations towards the new Member States with regard to the alleged surplus of stock on the day of accession to the EU and its threats to impose large financial penalties were unjustified in most cases and based on erroneous calculations; further notes that no disruption of the balance was observed on any of the agricultural markets that could have been the result of this alleged supply surplus; 19. Emphasises that the new Member States were forced to apply complementary national direct payments (CNDP, 'top-ups'), which can be considered as a form of cofinancing and a quasi-renationalisation of Community direct payments, and that this led to serious political and economic difficulties in various new Member States as they imposed a serious burden on the national budgets and limited the possibility of applying state aid schemes; 20. Points out that, due to budgetary constraints, contrary to the general objectives and principles of the CAP and contrary to the modulation in the EU-15, the majority of the new Member States were forced to regroup a part of their Community rural development allocations for CNDP purposes, as allowed by the Act of Accession; 21. Refers to the opinion of some new Member States that fully decoupled, area-based payments do not contribute entirely to the balanced development and sustainability of their agriculture, and that sector preferences and/or optional coupled payments could be necessary at least temporarily in certain Member States until 2013, and should be considered if requested; refers to the successful practice of the fully or partially coupled CNDP and
