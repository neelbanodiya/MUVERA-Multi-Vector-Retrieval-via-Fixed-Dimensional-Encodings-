Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (24 August 2011) In the past months the Portuguese Government had carefully evaluated all reasonable measures within its reach. It chose to request financial assistance from the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF)/the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM) being the most viable option. Selling gold in the present market circumstances would have further eroded confidence in the Portuguese sovereign and hence would have been detrimental to the Portugal's plans to return to viable refinancing conditions in the medium term.
