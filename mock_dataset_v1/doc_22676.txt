WRITTEN QUESTION E-1351/06 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (30 March 2006) Subject: Imposition of unilateral borders in Palestine by Israel The Commission is no doubt aware of growing fears that Israel may soon impose unilateral borders in Palestine, in the process illegally annexing East Jerusalem, the Jordan valley and the major settlement blocks in the West Bank. Such action would be in clear violation of international law and United Nations resolutions, and effectively undermine the viability of a Palestinian state, leaving Palestinians with less than half the land internationally recognised as Palestinian (and little more than 10 % of historic Palestinian territory), permanently reducing Palestinian towns and villages to a series of disconnected communities. Does the EU continue to regard the Green Line as the border of Israel under international law? What specific steps is the EU taking now to influence Israel to stop taking more Palestinian land for the illegal settlements, roads and the Wall in the West Bank and East Jerusalem? What actions will the EU take if Israel, as stated by Acting Prime Minister Olmert, defies international law and declares borders which annex the major settlement blocks, East Jerusalem and the Jordan valley? In addition to being an ongoing disaster of international justice, the situation in Palestine could soon become a humanitarian disaster, if aid is further withheld from Palestinians. Will the EU continue to fulfil its aid commitments, and insist that Israel does not block aid from reaching Palestinian areas?
