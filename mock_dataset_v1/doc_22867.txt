goods (e.g. in advertising or information provided on the package). According to the directive the buyer of a faulty product has the right to have it repaired or replaced. If repair or replacement is impossible or inconvenient, the buyer has the right to get his money back. According to the directive this guarantee is two years long i.e. the seller is liable where the lack of conformity becomes apparent within two years from the delivery of the goods. It is legitimate for a seller to refuse to repair or replace a product during this period only if the nature of the good and/or public statements about it makes clear that its normal life span is shorter. In any event, the life span consumers can reasonably expect must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Batteries and incandescent light bulbs are examples of products which typically have a shorter life span than two years. Finally, Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices OJ L.149/22, 11.6.2005. prohibits misleading practices which are likely to affect consumers' purchase decision, such as false or deceiving information on the main characteristics of the product and on the results to be expected from its use. Exaggerated information on the power of compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs might therefore be considered misleading by the national authorities responsible for the enforcement of the directive.
