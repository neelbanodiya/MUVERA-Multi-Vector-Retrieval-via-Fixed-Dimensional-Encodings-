WRITTEN QUESTION E-1384/10 by Elena Băsescu (PPE) to the Council (11 March 2010) Subject: Organisation of the European External Action Service The creation of the post of EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Commission Vice-President represents an opportunity for the Union to develop a more active foreign policy. In the coming period, Parliament will debate both the reform of the Staff Regulations and the budget of the European External Action Service (EEAS). On 9 February 2010 Parliament adopted a resolution on a revised Framework Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission for the next legislative term. Paragraph 3(f) of that resolution states in its sixth indent that ‘the Commission will support Parliament in the forthcoming negotiations on the European External Action Service (…) with a view to guaranteeing the full accountability of that service, including a transparent procedure for the nomination of special representatives and ambassadors’. In the context of Parliament's adoption of the report on the institutional aspects of the creation of the EEAS, can the Council state: 1. on what basis it intends to cooperate with Parliament in the creation of the European External Action Service; 2. whether it believes the recruitment of EEAS personnel should, in addition to criteria of competence, ensure a proportional representation of Member States?
