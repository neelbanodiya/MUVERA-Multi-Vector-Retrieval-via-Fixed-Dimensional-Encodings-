WRITTEN QUESTION P-3863/05 by Bernat Joan i Marí (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (18 October 2005) Subject: State holdings in privatised companies — the case of the SNCM In the debate currently taking place in France on the privatisation of the SNCM, the French Government has made conflicting statements regarding the justification for the State's holding in the SNCM and the legality of the procedures used. It has repeatedly argued that it is bound by European obligations. The French Government claims that it is selling the SNCM's assets, valued at EUR 500 million, to private funds for only EUR 35 million. It should be noted that this concerns a maritime company providing a public service between Corsica and the mainland. This forced march is being conducted without any detailed knowledge of the company's deficit figures. What are the EU rules governing situations of this kind? Do they actually prohibit a majority state holding in this kind of company? Do they include any clear provisions as regards the type of holding? Given that the SNCM provides a service of public interest for an island region which is in receipt of European structural funds, are there any Community decisions, directives or regulations under which provision is made for exceptional situations of this kind?
