try to give judgments; first I prefer to understand the circumstances, the facts…” she said. The European Parliament and immigration According to Ms Nkrumah, Europeans are generally in favour of integrating immigrants into their societies, and in this Parliament can play a role. “The European Parliament, with its direct representation of the European population, has to comply with the public feeling of welcome and tolerance.” Ms Nkrumah goes on to say "today, the phenomenon of immigration, although with a different intensity, represents a very important subject for all of Europe...I am sure that most of the leading politicians have a wish to get an in depth understanding of this new situation, starting with a constructive dialogue." How does she think we should help immigrants? "Certainly a common asylum policy, but also facing the issue of treatment of immigrants, and also tackling the problem of the illegal immigration…that needs a real common policy," she said. “The European Parliament has a solid structure (a relatively long term between elections)...compared to the fragility and the discontinuity of the national governments…we have to exploit this advantage in order to have a constructive and successful action.” The 2007 award will have a special resonance as it will mark the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome (1957), which founded the European Community. 20061016STO11664 Samia Nkrumah's article MEPs and national MPs debate legal and illegal immigration "Premio Napoli" award system Know more on Africa EN 1 PHOTO 20061016PHT11710.jpg EN 2 LINK http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/751/fo4.htm EN 4 LINK http://premionapoli.altervista.org/ EN 5 LINK http://www.inafrica.it/maldafrica/paesi/ghana.html -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20061002IPR11235 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
