Question for written answer P-3772/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Francisco Sosa Wagner (NI) (26 May 2010) Subject: Financial products (swaps) The financial crisis has revealed bad banking practices, amongst other effects and shortcomings. Many clients received bad advice when taking out mortgages and entered into contracts involving financial products (swaps) that were sold to them as insurance against fluctuating interest rates. For some months now, it has been confirmed that such swaps were derivative securities that were placed on bank loans. Claims submitted to the Banco de España or the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores were met with indifference. Both institutions have said that the protective measures set out in the directive on markets in financial instruments safeguarding investors (Directive 2004/39/EC of 21 April 2004) do not apply to these financial products, given the manner in which the Kingdom of Spain transposed this directive in its Law of 19 December 2007. 1. Has the Commission taken any steps against Spain’s possible infringement, on the grounds of its failure to incorporate European legislation correctly? 2. Does the Commission not consider that, in accordance with the case law of the ECJ on the direct application of directives, it should encourage the adoption of protective measures in order to safeguard investors, which would ensure, at the very least, that these defective contracts were suspended? What other measures has the Commission considered?
