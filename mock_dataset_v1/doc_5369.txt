WRITTEN QUESTION E-5272/06 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (4 December 2006) Subject: Gemayel assassination The assassination of Lebanese Minister Pierre Gemayel is the latest in a long series of terrorist acts of provocation against a government which is battling against the odds to build a peaceful future without bowing to the fundamentalist dictates of the ‘Party of God’ supported by Syria and Iran. The increasing number of Hezbollah missiles — now 20000 , compared with the 12000 which were present on 12 July 2006 — represents a permanent attack on the country's security and political stability. The existence of illegal armed militias, which receive funding and arms from outside the country and do not come under the government armed forces, is a constant threat to the legitimate government. Despite the presence of Unifil, the fundamentalists' aim appears to be to destabilise what is still a weak democracy in Lebanon. 1. Does the Commission not consider that the Union should step up its diplomatic and political action, taking a realistic approach to such violent and murderous attacks on the legitimate government? 2. Does it not believe that Europe should vigorously condemn the assassination of Mr Gemayel and warn the illegal militias operating in Lebanon against carrying out acts which weaken the legitimate government? 3. Why has the Commission not taken an initiative, together with the international community, to prevent sales of missiles and other weapons that escape the control of the Lebanese armed forces?
