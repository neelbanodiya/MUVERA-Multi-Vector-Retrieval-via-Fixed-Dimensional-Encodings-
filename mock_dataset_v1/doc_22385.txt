Question for written answer E-8650/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) (26 October 2010) Subject: Reform of the Law on Audits and Public Limited Liability Companies in Spain On 30 June 2010 the Spanish Parliament passed a reform of the Law on Audits and Public Limited Liability Companies with the aim of bringing it into line with the European Parliament and Council Directive 2006/43/EC of 17 May 2006 on legal auditing of annual and consolidated accounts. However in the course of this reform certain provisions were introduced governing the conditions under which public share offers can be made in Spain. These changes came hand-in-hand with a series of parliamentary amendments which were so obvious in intention as to result in the Spanish press christening the proposed and later adopted clauses with the name of the supposed beneficiary. Shareholders and management of several Spanish companies have protested that these changes, which increase the voting power of every shareholder, could contravene the basic principles of the European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/25/EC of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids. In fact, some of the affected companies have already declared their intention to contest this measure before the relevant European authorities, on the grounds that the changes in the law obstruct the free movement of capital, the principle of statutory freedom and, in particular, the rights of minority shareholders. It may be recalled that the abovementioned Directive on takeover bids clearly establishes as its main objective that all shareholders should receive equal treatment and be protected in the event of one person acquiring control of a company. In view of the above, Does the Commission have any evaluation of the reform to the Spanish law on audits referred to in this question? Does the Commission consider that this reform, by including these new regulations on procedures for public takeover bids, respects the principles of Directive 2004/25/EC? Is the Commission aware of any specific cases in Spain of commercial companies having been destabilised by these changes and of the effects of said changes on the markets, on share prices and on the activities of companies?
