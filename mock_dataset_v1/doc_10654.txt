WRITTEN QUESTION E-1941/08 by Angelika Niebler (PPE‑DE) and Miroslav Ouzký (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 April 2008) Subject: Implementation of the WEEE Directive Can the Commission confirm that internal components such as circuit boards and microchips that cannot perform any useful function until they are incorporated into a finished product such as a laptop or desktop computer are not ‘EEE’ within the meaning of Article 3(a) of Directive 2002/96/EC OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 24. ? Can the Commission also confirm that internal components such as circuit boards and microchips are not subject to any of the requirements of Directive 2002/96/EC until they have been incorporated into a final product, at which time such components become ‘WEEE’ as part of the final product at the time of discarding, within the meaning of Article 3(b) of Directive 2002/96/EC? Further to the above questions, can the Commission confirm that the entity responsible for all WEEE obligations provided for in Directive 2002/96/EC is the producer of the actual EEE and not the manufacturer/s of the individual internal components that are combined to create a final product?
