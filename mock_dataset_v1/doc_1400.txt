Question for written answer E-011052/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė (PPE) (29 November 2011) Subject: Disparities in direct farm payments The direct payment models proposed by the Commission are based indirectly on statistics on agricultural productivity for the period 2000-2002. Since that time, countries such as Lithuania have made considerable agricultural progress. Unfortunately, transitional periods are long when there are such large and disproportionate disparities between direct payments. When deciding on direct payment amounts and transitional periods, does the Commission conduct an impact assessment to establish the extent to which these will affect the agricultural competitiveness, on the EU and world markets, of Member States that receive smaller payments, notably bearing in mind that agricultural production costs are almost identical?
