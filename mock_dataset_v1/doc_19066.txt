Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (14 October 2008) The area of Elafonissos in Crete forms part of the Natura 2000 network as it is included in the list of Sites of Community Importance (SCI) established pursuant to the Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. (‘Nisos Elafonisos kai paraktia thalassia zoni’, GR4340002). The management of Natura 2000 sites is regulated by the provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. In particular, Article 6(2) requires measures to avoid damaging activities within Natura 2000 sites that could significantly disturb the species or deteriorate the habitats for which the site is designated. Furthermore, according to Article 6(3) new developments, including housing development, that are likely to have a significant effect on the site, have to be subject to an appropriate assessment with regard to the conservation values of the site and they can only be authorised if it is ascertained that they will not adversely affect the integrity of the site. It is the responsibility of the Member States to ensure that the Natura 2000 sites are managed in a way ensuring that habitats and species they host are maintained or restored in a favourable conservation status. The Commission can intervene if it is provided evidence that the relevant provisions of the directive are not complied with.
