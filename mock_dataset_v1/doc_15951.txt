Question for written answer E-000581/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) (2 February 2011) Subject: Pesticides and child leukaemia According to press reports, a study published by a group of US researchers has shown pesticides to be a potential cause of child leukaemia. Researchers at Georgetown University’s Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Centre have discovered high levels of pesticides in children suffering from leukaemia. Their research centred on 41 pairs of children with leukaemia and their mothers and another 41 pairs of healthy children and their mothers. Common pesticides present in most households were detected in the urine of over half the participants, but a higher level was noted in children suffering from leukaemia. The researchers sought to demonstrate that exposure to pesticides prior to birth, coupled with a genetic predisposition, could be a trigger factor for the illness. Has the EFSA conducted any studies into this matter? If it has not, does the Commission plan to request such a study?
