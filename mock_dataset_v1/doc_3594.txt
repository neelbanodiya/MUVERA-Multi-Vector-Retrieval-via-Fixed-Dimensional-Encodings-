In the four years from 2003 - 2006 Israel is expected to make a financial contribution to the Sixth Framework Programme totalling €191.9 million. The EU's contribution to the programme amounts to €16.3 billion. There is a very innovative research climate in Israel, and Israel still spends more money on research in relation to its GDP than the EU.
