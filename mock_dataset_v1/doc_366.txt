modes of transport permanently". Bulgarian Socialist MEP Evgeni Kirilov praised mobility week as "citizens learn more, become more conscious about the problems and how to solve them, including personal contribution by using bicycles and public transport instead of private cars, especially single users". Cities "car friendly" not "human friendly" To propose solutions to the growing issue of traffic it is important to know the problems our cities face. We asked the MEPs what they thought were the biggest challenges in this area. Jens Holm (GUE/NGL) of Sweden thought there were "too many cars" and not "sufficient alternatives" to getting around. He believes that cheap if not free public transport should be a "public responsibilty". He cycles as much as possible although admits that traffic in Brussels seems sometimes "too aggressive". On future strategies for dealing with the problem, Romanian MEP Alexandru Mortun (ALDE) believes that "building more roads is not the answer". He thinks authorities should "create traffic-calmed or car-free zones; launching speed reduction programmes; improving cycle networks and facilities". Italian MEP Alessandro Foglietta (UEN) blames the "lack of education and of respect of the rules". He also points to the problem of "the difficulty in leaving our cars at home especially when we live in areas which are not served by public transport or when we have special needs like health problems or with children". One solution to traffic usage could be imaginative solutions. Spending time in Brussels on her bike (which she rides to work), Zuzana Roithova has been impressed by the "bike lanes marked in colour and signs allowing cyclists to ride their bikes into one-way streets". For Sepp Kusstatscher - a man who walks to work - the balance is all wrong; cities are "car friendly" and not "human friendly". He goes on to say that "there exists really good examples how traffic - and mobility problems can be solved, namely by right of way for pedestrians and cyclists and by a good public local traffic network for persons". 20070913STO10375 Mobility week homepage Best practice guide Participating cities and towns Mobility week 2006: 22 September 06 Article: Environment MEPs back compulsory CO2 cap on cars: 19 September EN 1 PHOTO 20070921PHT10546.jpg EN 2 LINK http://www.mobilityweek.eu/ EN 3 LINK http://www.mobilityweek.eu/IMG/pdf_best_practice_en.pdf EN 4 LINK http://www.mobilityweek.eu/cities/participants_en.php?page=rubrique -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20060922STO10912 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070913STO10369 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS
