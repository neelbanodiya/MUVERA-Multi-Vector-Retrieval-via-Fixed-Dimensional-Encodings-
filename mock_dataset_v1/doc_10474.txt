finalizing the preliminary study the audit work should start early 2012 with a Special Report publication foreseen in April 2013. Personal objectives for a possible future mandate My immediate priority will be to actively contribute to the discharge 2010 debate for External Actions with the European Parliament and the Committee on Budgetary Control and continue the work on the two above mentioned performance audits (food security - fragile states). Furthermore I will be responsible for a third performance audit on the EU assistance to the Palestinian people. This task will start in the second quarter of 2012. I will cooperate actively in the preparation of the Court’s next strategy, focussing on further increasing the institution’s performance, promoting accountability and transparency and fostering added value. Among others I will strive for more focused and shorter Special Reports and further simplification of procedures that should lead to even more relevant and timely audits. I will also seek to improve the clarity and pertinence of conclusions and recommendations contained in the Court’s reports. Furthermore I will follow and open-dialogue policy with the European Parliament as an important tool for targeting the appropriate issues that should lead to a wider impact of the Court’s work and subsequent improved management of EU expenditure.
