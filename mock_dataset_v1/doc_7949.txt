Question for Question Time H-0333/2010 to the Council Part-session: July 2010 Rule 116 Liam Aylward (ALDE) Subject: Supporting the tourism industry Tourism is an essential component of the European economy, accounting for over 5% of EU GDP and providing employment to around 5.2% of Europe’s work-force. Given the current economic climate, it is essential that this sector should be supported and promoted. The Lisbon Treaty specifically refers to tourism and sets as an objective the promotion of the EU as one of the foremost tourist destinations in the world. In the light of this, it confers specific competence in this area on the Union and provides for decisions to be taken on a qualified-majority basis. In accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, ‘the Union shall complement the action of the Member States in the tourism sector, in particular by promoting the competitiveness of Union undertakings in that sector’ (Title XXII Tourism, Article 195). What has been done to date to support the tourism industry in the EU, to develop it and to promote its competitiveness? What is being done at European level to support this sector during the economic crisis?
