Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (9 September 2009) As mentioned in the reply given by the Commission to Written Question E‑2226/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp referred to by the Honourable Member, the Commission fully recognises the need for ensuring a level playing field for the European ports, in particular, as regards public funding. The Commission is intensively working on laying down guidelines on state aid to ports; currently it is preparing the impact assessment of such guidelines. However, as stated in the above quoted answer, the elaboration of the guidelines is a complex exercise, which requires extensive knowledge of the sector and an in-depth assessment of the different options available. The Commission is endeavouring to finalise the draft guidelines by the end of the year 2009. In the meantime, the Commission continues monitoring the state aid measures to ports on the basis of the Community rules on state aid contained in the EC Treaty in compliance with its previous practice and the relevant jurisprudence as it has been the case in the previous decisions of the Commission in the port sector See for instance the Commission decision of 10.12.2008 on JadeWeserPort (OJ C 137 of 17.6.2009), the Commission decision of 22.10.2004 on financial support for infrastructure in Flemish ports (OJ C 176 of 16.7.2005) and the Commission decision of 24.7.2007 on project main port development Rotterdam (OJ C 196 of 24.8.2007). These decisions can be found on the Commission website: http://ec.europa.eu/transport/stateaid/decisions_en.htm . With respect to the notification made by France of the measures in favour of the French port sector, the Commission is currently analysing it and cannot make further comments at this stage.
