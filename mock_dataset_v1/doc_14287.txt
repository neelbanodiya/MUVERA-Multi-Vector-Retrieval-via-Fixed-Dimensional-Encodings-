Europe is developing slowly; calls on the EU to create a nanoscience and nanotechnology patent monitoring system governed by the European Patent Office; 16. Encourages general reforms in the field of the European patent system in order to cut the costs of patenting and to improve the accessibility of patents for SMEs; stresses the need for greater transparency and clear limits to the scope of patent protection; 17. Is convinced that Europe's chances of being and staying at the forefront in this field hinge upon its capacity for coordination; reiterates the need for a single Community focal point for coordination and the importance of the EU 'speaking with one voice' on the international stage, particularly in the light of the challenges presented by patent protection in China; calls therefore on the Commission and Members States to devise mechanisms to effectively coordinate actions in this field; urges the Commission to take into account in it's policy making all activities within the OECD (e.g. definitions, nomenclature, risk management) and UNESCO (ethics); 18.Recognizes that an essential element of a responsible strategy is the integration of social, health and safety aspects into the technological development of nanosciences and nanotechnologies; in this respect, urges the Commission, Member States and European industry to engage in an effective dialogue with all stakeholders, so to steer developments along a sustainable path; 19. Stresses that assessment of the technological risks posed (from conception to disposal or recycling) to human health, consumers, workers and the environment must be carried out throughout the life cycle of nanoscience and nanotechnology products; 20. Recommends that the lists of ingredients in consumer products identify the addition of manufactured nanoparticulate material; 21. Emphasises the need to respect high ethical principles and welcomes the planned reviews on issues such as non-therapeutic human enhancement and links between nanosciences and nanotechnologies and individual privacy; expects the reviews to be public and to include a thorough analysis of nanomedicine; 22. Supports the setting up of ethical committees which, by providing independent scientific advice, will help ensure that the public is properly informed and help create a climate of trust based on awareness of the possible risks and the benefits associated with the use of discoveries in the field of nanotechnologies; 23. Welcomes the consultation conducted for this proposal and encourages the Commission to continue improving its work in order to respond to the increasing demand for better regulation; 24.
