Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (2 December 2010) The Commission is indeed aware of the case referred to in this question. With regard to European Union legislation for takeovers in the form of an exchange of shares as outlined in the question, the only tax relief available is that which is provided for under secondary EC law namely Council Directive 2009/133/EC of 19 October 2009 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:310:0034:0046:EN:PDF (Merger Directive). Under the terms of Article 8 of the Merger Directive, rollover relief is only available if certain conditions are fulfilled. Those conditions include, inter alia , that the acquiring company as well as the acquired companies are resident in Member States of the EU and that any cash payment, in addition to transferred shares, does not exceed 10 % of the nominal value of the transferred shares. The Commission understands that in the case referred to in this question that the conditions of Article 8 were not fulfilled and therefore it is not applicable. Where the Merger Directive is not applicable the provision of rollover tax relief may be available in the relevant national tax system. The question of the provision of tax reliefs, over and above the relief described above, is a matter for the United Kingdom who is free to design its own tax system in the context of their overall economic and budgetary position. The Commission is not currently planning any amendment to Article 8 of the Merger Directive. Moreover, the Commission is not currently planning to propose amendments to the Takeover Bids Directive (2004/25/EC) http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0025:EN:HTML . The functioning of the Takeover Bids Directive will however be reviewed in 2011.
