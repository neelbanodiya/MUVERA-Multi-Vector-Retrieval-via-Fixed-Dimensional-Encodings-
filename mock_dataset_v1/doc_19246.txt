These funds will serve the long term development of Eritrea and their exact use will be negotiated between the EC and the Eritrean Government taking into account all the provisions of the Agreement on the fundamental principles of the African, Caribbean and Pacific/EU partnership. Several programmes under the Ninth EDF which cover vital sectors like food security and infrastructures are still underway. The Commission and the Member States will spare no efforts to continue to engage the Eritrean authorities on human rights within the framework of the political dialogue foreseen under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.
