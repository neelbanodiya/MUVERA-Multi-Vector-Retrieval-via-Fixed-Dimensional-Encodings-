Answer given by Mrs Kuneva on behalf of the Commission (25 July 2007) The Commission is perfectly aware that both a large proportion of normal trade and a large proportion of dangerous consumer products (such as toys and hair-dryers mentioned by the Honourable Member) imported into the European Union come from the People's Republic of China. The Commission and the Chinese Government have, at the highest level, set themselves the shared objective of removing dangerous goods from this trade. The Commission is taking steps on three main axes: (1) cooperating with the Chinese Government, agreeing on safety standards, and training Chinese market inspectors to enforce these safety standards, (2) educating Chinese manufacturers about safety requirements and making European safety standards easily accessible, (3) identifying as precisely as possible the Chinese manufacturer of a dangerous product found in Europe and transmitting this information to the Chinese authorities for follow-up. Indeed, based on Memoranda of Understanding, ongoing activities in this area include exchanges of information on technical regulations and standards in the field of product safety, exchange of information on safeguard and rapid alert system (RAPEX) notifications and agreement for the Chinese to follow up and report back, and seminars on a wide range of product safety issues. In addition, there is an understanding that those products which statistically present the highest degree of non-compliance with EU safety requirements are made subject to reinforced mandatory safety checks prior to obtaining export licences from China. The first evidence shows that this work is starting to bear fruit. In any event, the proportion of dangerous consumer products of Chinese origin has remained fairly stable over the years, which suggests that the increase in numbers of intercepted Chinese products is not a sign of decrease of quality and respect of safety standards in China but rather of increased vigilance and effectiveness of the European market surveillance network. The Commission also cooperates with the United States' authorities with whom the Commission has identical concerns regarding Chinese products. The Commission, in its recent reply to Written Question E‑2926/07 by Mr Matsakis, explained in more detail the conditions and mechanisms for market surveillance to identify and ban from the European market the dangerous products identified.
