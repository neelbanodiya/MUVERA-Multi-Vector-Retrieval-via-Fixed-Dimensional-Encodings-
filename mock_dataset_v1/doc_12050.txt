WRITTEN QUESTION E-0468/07 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (8 February 2007) Subject: Distilled and recycled water Because of the extreme climatic conditions currently being observed, certain areas of the Mediterranean EU Member States area are already faced with the prospect of water shortages. In view of this: 1. Does the Commission consider that the distillation and recycling of water intended for human consumption is an appropriate response to the problem of water shortages? What are the financial and ecological implications of this approach? 2. What does it think of the health and safety guarantees being given to consumers of distilled and recycled water? 3. Does it have any information regarding the results obtained anywhere within the EU where this procedure is already being followed? Does it have any comparative data concerning the EU Member States which are facing water shortages?
