Question for written answer P-7545/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE) (20 September 2010) Subject: Election observation mission to Nigeria Given the EU's commitment to strengthening the democratic process worldwide, and the fact that it sent an Election Observation Mission (EOM) to Nigeria in 2007, could the Commission please confirm whether the EU will be sending an EOM to Nigeria during the forthcoming elections currently scheduled for 22 January 2011? Given the proximity of the upcoming elections, if the EU will be sending a mission, please could it confirm the date of its exploratory mission to Nigeria in advance of the EOM?
