the financial year 2006 for agriculture, since, for the first time, there will be expenditure on the single-payment and regional-payment schemes and the modulation mechanism; furthermore, should there be no agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective, the 2006 budget will serve as the basis for the 2007 budget; 2. Stresses that, in connection with the differences in implementation of the CAP reform in the Member States, problems may arise with claims for payments, and in this context calls for European budget funds to be paid only to farmers whose business is based within the European Union; 3. Regrets that on an accounting basis only, and without taking account of any political priority, the Council has adopted an across-the-board reduction of 0.56 % in all market and income support spending above EUR 50 m, with the exception of three CAP reform lines (single-payment and regional-payment schemes, single area payment scheme and additional amounts of aid); notes that that will result in a reduction of EUR 150 m, including more than EUR 100 m in direct aids alone, to which should be added the reduction of more than EUR 75 m in agricultural spending (such as on Leader and Sapard, etc.) coming under other headings; 4. Takes the view that the Council conducted no serious analysis before making these reductions; what is purely an accounting exercise has brought about absurd reductions in funding in some cases; 5. Regrets the reduction against funding for SAPARD when the programme’s implementation rate is high, which may well lead, in 2006, to the same situation as in 2005, i.e. the need to make use of other budget lines, during the year, in order to provide the necessary appropriations; 6. Takes the view that the Commission’s proposed margin of EUR 1.21 bn below the financial perspective ceiling is already ample to cope with any market-related crises or potential dollar fluctuations and that, consequently, the Council’s reduction and the resulting EUR 1.35 bn margin present a misleading picture of the resources needed for the conduct of agricultural policy; 7. Takes the view that the amounts entered in the PDB for agriculture represent the bare minimum and therefore calls for all PDB lines to be restored, which is all the more vital given that the Commission’s forecasts, on which the PDB figures are based, very often turn out to be optimistic by comparison with actual market developments; 8.
