passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights ( COM(2001) 784 – C5‑0700/2001 – 2001/0305(COD)) (Codecision procedure: first reading) The European Parliament , – having regard to the Commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council ( COM(2001) 784 OJ C 103 E, 30.4.2002, p. 225. ), – having regard to Article 251(2) and Article 80(2) of the EC Treaty, pursuant to which the Commission submitted the proposal to Parliament ( C5‑0700/2001 ), – having regard to Rule 67 of its Rules of Procedure, – having regard to the report of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism and the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy ( A5‑0298/2002 ), 1. Approves the Commission proposal as amended; 2. Asks to be consulted again should the Commission intend to amend the proposal substantially or replace it with another text; 3. Instructs its President to forward its position to the Council and Commission. Text proposed by the Commission Amendments by Parliament Amendment 1 Recital 7 (7) The trouble and inconvenience to passengers caused by cancellation of flights should also be reduced, except when cancellation occurs in exceptional circumstances beyond the responsibility of an air carrier or that of its subcontracting agent. This can best be achieved by requiring air carriers, before the scheduled time of departure, to contact the passengers affected and agree with them the conditions under which they volunteer to surrender their reservations. (7) The trouble and inconvenience to passengers caused by cancellation of flights should also be reduced, except when cancellation occurs due to force majeure and is therefore beyond the responsibility of an air carrier or that of its subcontracting agent. This can best be achieved by requiring air carriers, before the scheduled time of departure, to contact the passengers affected and agree with them the conditions under which they volunteer to surrender their reservations. Justification It seems appropriate to use uniform terms in the directives concerned with compensation for trouble and inconvenience and even financial loss arising in connection with air travel. The term ‘force majeure’ from Article 4, paragraph 6, subparagraph b(ii) of Council Directive 90/314/EEC on package tourism is therefore used. Amendment 2 Recital 10 (10) Since the distinction between scheduled and non-scheduled air services is weakening, protection should apply to passengers not only on scheduled but also on non- scheduled
