Reply (2 August 2006) At their summit in Hampton Court in October 2005, EU leaders called for an increase in Europe’s investment in defence research and technology (R&T) to help improve military capabilities for EU crisis management operations. The Ministers of Defence of 24 EU Member States (excluding Denmark), meeting in the Steering Board of the European Defence Agency, have supported the aim of spending more, spending better and spending more together on Defence R&T. The joint R&T investment initiative, with a first programme focused on Force Protection, is an attempt to turn this political will into practice. On 15 May, the Council directed the Agency to complete work on both the joint investment mechanism and the content of the first programme on Force Protection before the end of June, so that those who want to participate can set aside funds for 2007. EU defence ministers have not yet agreed to create a common defence research and technology fund. Interested Member States participating in the Agency will commit themselves once the ongoing work is finalised.
