WRITTEN QUESTION E-6358/07 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (18 December 2007) Subject: Pollution of the River Sperchios Pollution of the waters of the River Sperchios by chemical industrial waste, urban effluent, pesticides and fertilisers is rising to hazardous levels. The waters of the River Sperchios are used to irrigate the paddy fields in the region of Anthili (Fthiotida). Pollution from the river is carried into the fields, with a devastating impact on the health of farmers and consumers, and into the river estuary and the Gulf of Maliakosa protected area of particular ecological and economic value for the Lamia region. Given that the basin of the River Sperchios is incorporated in the Natura 2000 network (GR2440002) as a protected area, will the Commission say whether it has received information concerning the pollution of the River Sperchios? Would the Commission be prepared to co-finance a special programme to reduce pollution of the Sperchios if the Greek authorities were to submit such a programme?
