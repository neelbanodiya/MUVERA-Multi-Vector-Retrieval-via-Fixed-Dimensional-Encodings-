the Council establishing the Culture 2000 programme outlines as one of the programme’s objectives improved access to and participation in culture in the European Union for as many citizens as possible. Culture 2000 involves coordination between the cultural sector and other sectors with common and converging interests, for example, culture, education and youth (in particular, presentations to schools and colleges of audiovisual and multimedia products on European culture, with commentaries by creative or performing artists). Activities in the framework of Culture 2000 should concentrate more on projects which deal with Europe's cultural diversity, which promote a better reciprocal knowledge of European citizens and which provides a better understanding of contemporary cultural creation. FINAL REMARKS All policy statements on national education emphasise the importance of the cultural dimension, and of promoting creative abilities. The necessity of engaging children in the practice and study of the arts and culture is also emphasised. In practice, however, as a survey of the Member States of the Council of Europe conducted in 1999 indicated, the actual status of culture and provision for the arts is less prominent although increasing. Therefore it seems that there is a need to stimulate a debate on these topics both at national and EU level.
