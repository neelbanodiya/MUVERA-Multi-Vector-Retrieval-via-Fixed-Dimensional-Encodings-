Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) EU legislation setting down the basis for support given under Pillar II of the common agricultural policy, namely rural development policy, allows for aid under the agri-environmental measure to protect a threatened animal breed to be given to an institute such as the one described, as well as to farmers Articles 39(4) and (5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 (OJ L 277, 21.10.2005, p. 20). . It must be noted, however, that rural development policy is implemented on the basis of shared management between the European Commission and the Member States. Each Member State proposes how it is going to implement the individual measures that it chooses to include in its rural development programme(s). The Commission adopts the proposal if it is satisfied that it remains within the framework laid down in the European legislation. With regard to the Rural Development Programme for Poland 2007-2013, the agri-environmental measure only provides for farmers as beneficiaries. The agri-environmental measure in the Polish programme includes a sub-measure with the objective of preserving endangered animal genetic resources in agriculture, but goat breeds are not included in the list of breeds covered. With respect to the 2014-2020 programming period, the legislative proposals currently under consideration make the same provisions as those described above. Furthermore, the Commission is currently reflecting on how the current Community programme for the Conservation of Genetic Resources in Agriculture can continue.
