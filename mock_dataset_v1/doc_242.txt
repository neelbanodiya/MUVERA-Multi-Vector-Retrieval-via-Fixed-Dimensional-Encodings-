Question for written answer E-9995/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) (1 December 2010) Subject: Discrimination against Romanian citizens resident in Italy The Rome section of the Romanian Identity Party recently reported the following incident which occurred on 10 October at Fabrica de Roma in the province of Viterbo. It was sparked off by the removal by carabinieri of an automobile belonging to a Romanian national, an operation which was filmed by another Romanian citizen who happened to be nearby. He was then attacked by the Italian driver of the tow truck, who broke his jaw. He was also insulted by the carabinieri, who refused to intervene, accusing him of causing the incident. His aggressor then initiated legal proceedings, claiming to have been attacked by his Romanian victim, a version upheld by an article published on 12 October in the Corriere di Viterbo daily newspaper. However, once the film of the incident had been seen, the newspaper was forced to rectify its report. The Romanian victim of the attack was hospitalised for over 40 days because of injuries sustained. Unfortunately, incidents of this type, prompted by unfavourable media coverage of the Romanian community in Italy, occur frequently. Can the Commission indicate whether, in this instance, the Italian carabinieri were guilty of discrimination under the relevant EU legislation?
