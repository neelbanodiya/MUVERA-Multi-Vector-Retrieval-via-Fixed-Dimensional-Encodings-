WRITTEN QUESTION E-0474/10 by Marisa Matias (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: Environmental and social balance sheet of EU policy on biofuels The growing use of biofuels has led to changes in land use: land previously used to grow food is now being used to produce biofuels, leading, inter alia , to deforestation or land clearance in other parts of the globe to replace lost agricultural production. This process has led to the release of substantial quantities of carbon, and a number of scientific studies suggest that this may even undermine claims that biofuels are environmentally friendly. In the debate on sustainability criteria for biofuels, one of Parliament's demands was that the impact of the indirect change in land use should be adequately taken into account. Decision-taking was postponed because the Commission had allegedly promised to adopt new ways of including the impact of indirect changes in land use in its method for calculating greenhouse gas emissions caused by biofuels. Given that the sole justification for public aid polices for biofuels is the supposed reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and given that this justification may now be compromised, will the Commission say: — What progress has been made in factoring in greenhouse gas emissions caused by indirect changes in land use due to EU biofuels policy? — Does it consider that the present mechanisms for evaluating the scale of indirect changes in land use are adequate and will it ensure their inclusion in calculations of greenhouse gas emissions from biofuels in view of the EU's objectives? — When it submits to Parliament studies evaluating the impact of biofuels policy, will it include the data on the indirect use of land and submit them to public scrutiny? Will it endeavour to take this concern into account in implementing aid? — Does it considerable it viable to submit in the near future a proposal for a European public policy to support biofuels which reflects the commitments made in the field of human rights and food sovereignty for producer countries, in line with the Millennium Development Goals?
