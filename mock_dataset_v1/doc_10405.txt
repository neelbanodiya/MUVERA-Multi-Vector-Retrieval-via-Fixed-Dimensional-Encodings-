Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2008) Nonylphenol ethoxylate (NPE) is a surfactant, used mainly in detergents, but also in textile softeners. It can pose a risk to the environment when discharged into waste water due to the formation of the toxic metabolite nonylphenol (NP). For this reason, Directive 2003/53/EC OJ L 178, 17.7.2003. does not allow the use of NPE in textile processing after January 2005 unless there is no discharge to the environment from the process. Directive 2003/53/EC restricted the processing of textiles, but not the NPE content of processed textiles. The retention of NPE in textiles due to washing in such detergent was not considered to be significant. The Swedish authorities recently informed the Commission of the presence of NPE in a number of widely available clothing articles at levels similar to those mentioned by the Honourable Member. The Commission would also like to inform that the risk to the environment from NP due to NPE in textiles is now being evaluated by the United Kingdom as a follow-up action to the EU risk assessment on NP for which it acted as rapporteur. The evaluation will be completed early 2009 and will, if appropriate, lead to a restrictions proposal under REACH (Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 OJ L 396, 30.12.2006. ). As regards compulsory labelling of textile products, Directive 96/74/EC OJ L 32, 3.2.1997. establishes the obligation to include information about their fibre composition. It is not foreseen to extend the scope of compulsory labelling to chemical substances. Concerning actions being taken on NP and NPE under the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑2649/08 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB by Ms Westlund. The Commission would like to ensure that the original objectives of Directive 2003/53/EC are met and therefore welcomes all information that would facilitate a decision on whether to extend the restriction to regulate the nonylphenol ethoxylate content of textiles.
