inside the outermost regions belonging to a Member State and that it will not affect the distribution of funds between Member-States under the regulation (see exact text of amendment 3). Remote and outlying regions: management of fishing fleets Margie SUDRE (EPP-ED, F) Report on the proposal for a Council regulation on the management of fishing fleets registered in the outermost regions ( COM(2003) 175 – C5-0243/2003 – 2003/0062(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0409/2003 Procedure : Consultation Debate : 03.12.2003 In December 2002 the Council decided, in the context of CFP reform, to phase out the granting of public aid for the construction of new fishing vessels by the end of 2004. However, an exception was made for the outermost regions of the EU (as defined in Article 299 (2) of the Treaty), which will be allowed to expand fleets using FIFG funds until 31/12/2006 - provided that the situation regarding stocks permits such an increase. The regulation now proposed provides a legal basis for that exception. The rapporteur Margie SUDRE (EPP-ED, F) again wants to change the legal basis (see above) to Article 299(2). She also presents an amendment (Amendment 6) asking the Commission to report on the implementation of the regulation by 31.12.2006 and to suggest adjustments, taking into account the socio-economic needs of the regions concerned and the state of stocks. In other words, the definitive decision to phase out public aids should not be taken now, but kept open.
