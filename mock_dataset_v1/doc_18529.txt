to aid practices, so that aid can play an effective role in the fight against global poverty. Also in that sense, it can promote policy dialogue with emerging donors such as China or India and private aid philanthropists to become part of the aid effectiveness debate. The EU has made efforts to comply with the new Aid agenda through its new proposal of MDG's an increased budget support, the improvement of country systems and the predictability of EC aid. It is also putting forward the concept of division of labour and managements for results, which it hopes would gain the support of European member states and ensure a progressive and consolidated European voice in Accra. All this progress has been most welcomed, but should be followed by concrete actions at field level and accompanied by the decisive steps in favour of democratic ownership, accountability and better aid quality outlined in this report. The recommendations included in this report cover a wide range of key areas such as the increase, predictability and coordination of EU's aid; the alignment with partner countries’ plans and systems; the untying of aid and the reform of Technical Assistance. In 2005, the European Union committed itself to radically improve the impact of its development cooperation through initiatives for more aid, delivered faster and more effectively. However, we should not forget that Aid reform is only one of the steps that the EU must take along with making its trade, security, migration, agriculture and other policies coherently work to benefit developing countries and promoting a fair international financial and trade system in favour of development.
