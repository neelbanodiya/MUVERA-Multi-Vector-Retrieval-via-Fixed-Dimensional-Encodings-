Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2011) The restrictions on days at sea for different gear categories form part of the long-term management plan for cod as documented in Regulation 1342/2008 OJ L 348, 24.12.2008. . They do not apply to vessels fishing for pelagic species. While gears with 120 mm mesh may be more selective than gears with 80 mm mesh for some fish species, it is important to note that a 120 mm meshed gear is the gear used in a targeted cod fishery. This gear therefore catches more cod than other gears and therefore fisheries using this gear are subject to the effort restrictions which are primarily intended to reduce catches of cod. The relative allowances of days at sea for each gear type reflect the national baselines established by the 2008 regulation and any subsequent reductions that have been applied. As a result, the relative allocations of days at sea for each gear type in 2011 are a result of what has happened in national fleets over recent years, rather than a deliberate attempt to favour one gear over another. The cod plan and its associated management measures are currently being reviewed by the scientific bodies in order to enable the Commission to prepare a new long term management plan for cod with a multispecies approach compatible with the reform of the common fisheries policy.
