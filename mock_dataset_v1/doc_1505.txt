WRITTEN QUESTION E-5548/07 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (13 November 2007) Subject: Possible reinforcement of the role of the European Network Information Security Agency (ENISA) In an article published in the European Voice on 18 October 2007, under the title ‘U telecoms agency to take on cyber terrorists’ the journalist outlines in considerable detail, Commission's plans to establish a new European Agency with the potential to ‘supplant’ the European Network Information Security Agency (ENISA). I would therefore like to ask the Commission the following: 1. Does the aforementioned article reflect the real intention of the Commission about ‘dissolving’ ENISA, with view to establishing a new Agency? 2. Why have the new tasks, competences, budget and staff not been given to the existing Agency, ENISA, as was the case with the Agency EUMC in Vienna, which was converted into the Fundamental Rights Agency? 3. Why does the Commission not help the Agency to develop by increasing its budget, staff and competences, as has been recognised as necessary by the stakeholders?
