Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (24 March 2006) The Commission takes every suitable opportunity to raise its concerns relating to freedom of expression in Turkey and Article 301 of the new penal code with the Turkish authorities. Such concerns have been raised again during the meeting of the EU Ministerial Troika and Turkey in Vienna on 8 March and have been expressed in the regular monitoring of Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria conducted by the Commission. In the 2005 progress report on Turkey, published on 9 November 2005 SEC(2005)1426. , there is detailed reference to these concerns. Following the Commission’s proposal, the Council decision of 23 January 2006 on the revised accession partnership with Turkey OJ L 22, 26.1.2006. includes priorities on guaranteeing freedom of expression. Implementation of the legislative reforms of the past few years remains uneven. There have been several occasions in recent weeks when the judiciary has acted in accordance with the relevant European standards, and with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. These include the cases of novelist Orhan Pamuk and of journalist Hrant Dink. However, other pending cases of non-violent expression of opinion show that there is still too much room of discretion for restrictive interpretations. In the case that the trend of restrictive application is confirmed, the relevant articles of the penal code would need to be amended.
