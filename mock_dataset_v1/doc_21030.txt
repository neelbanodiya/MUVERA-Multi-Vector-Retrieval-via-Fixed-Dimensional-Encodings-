Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2010) With regard to the Honourable Member first and third question, the Commission considers that financing of ports is an important issue which requires careful analysis. This is why this analysis is still ongoing and, at this stage, no precise schedule can be given. As to the second question, this dossier has been transferred to the Commission's Directorate General for Competition (DG COMP) together with the entirety of state aid competencies in the field of transport. The Commission wishes however to recall that Commission decisions adopting guidelines for the assessment of state aid are adopted by the College of Commissioners. Finally, with regard to the last question, the Commission does not need guidelines to assess. Thus, in the field of port infrastructure, the Commission has already assessed various state aid measures on the basis of direct application of Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. The most recent Commission decisions in this field are: state aid No N 385/2009 — Latvia — Public financing of port infrastructure in Ventspils port; state aid No C21/2009 — Greece — Public financing of infrastructure and equipment at the Port of Pireus; state aid No N 105/2008, N 168/2008, N 169/2008 — Greece — Public financing of infrastructure and equipment at the Port of Pireus; state aid No N 110/2008 — Germany — Public financing of the JadeWeserPort Project The cases can be consulted in http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/register/ .
