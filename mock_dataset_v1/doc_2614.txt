ORAL QUESTION H-0771/05 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Catherine Stihler to the Council Subject: Microbicide clinical trials 4.9 million people were infected with HIV in 2004, more than in any previous year. As 75% of young people infected are women and girls, the increasing vulnerability of women is underlined along with the inherent need to expand current prevention options, particularly for women. The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was set up in February 2004, with one third of its budget to be funded by Member States (plus one third from the Commission, and one third from the private sector). In the light of the rise in HIV infection rates and the creation of the EDCTP, can the Council provide information on what funding Member States have provided to the EDCTP, and as a result, which microbicide clinical trials are currently being funded by the EDCTP?
