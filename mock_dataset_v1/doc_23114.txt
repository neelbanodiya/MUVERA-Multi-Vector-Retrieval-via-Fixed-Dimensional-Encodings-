is on security, law and order and provision of basic services; and the second phase of state-building which focuses on governance and the institutions which will deliver it; with the proviso that: a) the second phase should not take place until the country is stabilised, as institutions created before stabilisation will reflect the character of the conflict and not what the country needs for a stable and enduring peace, b) in the state-building phase it is important to compromise to conform to the norms and expectations of the citizens of the nation concerned and not the ideals of the interveners, c) as the state-building phase progresses interveners will need to hand over individual institutions to the domestic authorities; it is at this time that potential setbacks can occur and need to be accepted, provided they are not fundamental to the progress that the country is making; 4. Highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of conflicts in EU political dialogues with third countries and in development cooperation programmes so as to develop mechanisms to provide early warning signs of failing states by looking at possible predictors or indicators of civil violence such as historic divisions, ethnic and tribal grievances, religious conflicts, inequity and poverty; in this context, stresses in particular the need to allocate new funding to adaptation and environmental protection as a means of preventing the rise of climate and environment-related conflicts; 5. Calls the Commission to designate conflict prevention as a cross-cutting issue in development cooperation and to integrate conflict sensitivity and conflict analysis into existing and new policies, into Country and Regional Strategy Papers, and into all the relevant financial instruments for external cooperation; 6. Recalls that peace is not only the absence of war, that there is no peace without justice and that, furthermore, the end of hostilities does not necessarily result in security for men and women; also recalls the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building, and stresses the importance of their equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security; 7. Strongly believes that every effort must be made to ensure minimum standards of basic services for those populations affected by conflict, in particular in relation to access to food, clean water and sanitation, medicines, health care (including reproductive health) and personal security; in the immediate term
