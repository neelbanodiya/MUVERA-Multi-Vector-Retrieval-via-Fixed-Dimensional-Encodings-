Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (7 October 2008) The Commission has not prepared any policy/position papers on the effect on EU‑United States (US) relations of a possible election of Barack Obama as President of the US. The Commission of course follows closely the general prospects of the US Presidential and Congressional electoral contests of 4 November 2008 so as to prepare for a smooth transition towards the new incumbents. Furthermore, Commissioner in charge of External Relations participated in the informal meeting of Foreign Ministers called by the French Presidency on 5 and 6 September 2008, at which the future of EU‑US relations was one of the topics discussed. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner informed about the outcome in press briefings. Readouts of the press conferences are available under https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.asp?liste=20080908.html&submit.x=12&submit.y=7#Chapitre4 Meanwhile, until a new President of the US is formally sworn in, the Commission will continue to work together with the current US administration as closely as in the past. The Commission will do its part to ensure that EU‑US relations make a smooth transition to the new administration.
