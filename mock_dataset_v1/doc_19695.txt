Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2011) The Commission is aware of the imprisonment of various individuals following the January 2011 uprising in Egypt but, as the Honourable Member will appreciate, cannot interfere in domestic legal proceedings in third countries. That being said, in contacts with the interim Egyptian government, President Barroso, on his visit to Cairo on 14 July 2011, as well as High Representative and Vice-President Ashton and Commissioner Füle, have emphasised the importance of the interim authorities’ duty to uphold basic human rights including the right to a fair trial by independent civilian courts. Respect of these fundamental human rights norms is an essential element in any modern democratic society.
