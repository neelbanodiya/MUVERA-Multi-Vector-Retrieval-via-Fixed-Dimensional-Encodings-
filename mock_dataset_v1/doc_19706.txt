WRITTEN QUESTION E-2945/10 by Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Further to Written Question E-4999/09 on the high-speed train in the vicinity of the Sagrada Familia As Mr Dimas correctly stated in his reply of 19 November 2009 to Question E‑4999/09, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) does state that with regard to the cultural and ethnographic heritage, there are in the area where the operations are to be carried out, sights which could be affected by the implementation of the project, as well as archaeological remains, various listed Civil War shelters and a range of unique buildings, classified as Architectural Heritage, above all the Church of the Sagrada Familia and the Casa Milá-La Pedrera, which are classified as cultural properties of national interest and the Torre del Fang. http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2007/06/19/pdfs/A26783-26789.pdf As a preventive measure to protect the Sagrada Familia, the EIA then goes on to say that in the case of the Sagrada Familia, ‘the developer’s Supplementary Information Study (SIS) proposes the construction of a screen of linked piles on the side of the tunnel closer to the protected building in question, so as to enhance the guarantee that it will not be affected. The 1.5m diameter piles, placed two metres apart, will be supported by a 3m x 3m concrete block, which in turn will rise on ground improved by injections to consolidate it. The concrete block and improved ground will between them serve to provide the rigidity to restrict movement at the head of the piles. The depth of the piles will be 41m and the barrier will be 240m in length.’ On 25 February 2010, a hole measuring 2m x 1.5m appeared in the Calle Valencia, between the Paseo de Gracia and Pau Claris, close to the building work for the high-speed train. This hole was caused by recent heavy rain, and what is putting the Sagrada Familia at serious risk is, precisely, the build-up of water, particularly if the protective screen were to be built since it will act as a dam: two streams run under the church. Furthermore, the Zona Franca Metro Line No 9 has been stuck underground for a year now due to a miscalculation in the EIA with regard to the hardness of the subsoil. Given that the EIA got it wrong with regard to its forecasts about the build-up of water in the subsoil of Barcelona,
