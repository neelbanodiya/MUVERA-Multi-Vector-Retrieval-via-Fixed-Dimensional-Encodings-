While agreeing with the Commission's recommendations, MEPs in the committee want it to go even further and to consider including polycyclic aromatics (such as PAH) and heavy metals (e.g. Nickel and Vanadium) among the emissions to be covered by the strategy. They also say that the Commission's overall objective (of reducing the contribution of ships' atmospheric emissions towards environmental and human health problems in the EU) should be extended so that it also aims explicitly to reduce ships' emissions of greenhouse gases (such as CO2) and their contribution to global warming. The committee notes the Commission's intention of identifying and undertaking specific actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from marine shipping if the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) had not adopted a concrete ambitious strategy on this by 2003. The draft resolution notes with concern that the Commission's proposal on the revision of the 1999 directive on the sulphur content of marine fuels would only reduce sulphur emissions from seagoing ships in European sea areas by about 10%, as compared to their emission level in 2000, and pointed out that emissions needed to be reduced by at least 80% (as Parliament had recommended at its 1st reading in June 2003) in order to achieve the objectives of the 6th Environmental Action Programme. The Commission is accordingly urged to set more ambitious targets as regards the proposed limit values and the sea areas to be covered and also to analyse the costs and benefits of alternative, more far-reaching abatement measures. MEPs in the committee also want the Commission to give a stronger commitment to drawing up legislation to reduce NOx (Nitric Oxide) emissions, rather than linking this action to future developments in the IMO. Whereas the Commission had pledged only to take such action if the IMO had not proposed tighter international NOx standards for marine engines by the end of 2006, MEPs call on the Commission to present a proposal, before the end of 2004, for NOx emission standards for ships with the aim of reducing NOx emissions from ship engines. Lastly, the committee expresses concern that the Commission has not yet come forward with proposals for an EU system of differentiated charges for all transport modes that takes into account marginal social costs including the external costs of air pollution and climate change, despite it being announced in the strategy that such a proposal is due in " early 2003
