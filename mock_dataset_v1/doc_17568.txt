a sustained financial commitment towards this region; therefore restores to the level of the 2005 budget the appropriations earmarked for cooperation with Latin American countries. Human Rights and Democracy Promotion 15. Condemns the unacceptable cut in the resources allocated to the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (chapter 19 04); deplores the attempt, based on unconvincing technical arguments, to wind down the programme with a view to its mainstreaming into the four new instruments for financial assistance in the external policy area; 16. Confirms its determination to maintain a separate legislative instrument in the area of democracy and human rights, with global coverage, managed independently of national authorities, in close association with local NGOs, democracy foundations and civil society at large; recalls Parliament's request, supported by NGOs and other human rights and democracy actors, to be fully involved and to provide political steering for the work of the Commission in this area; Pre-accession and accession countries 17. Insists on greater budgetary transparency in relation to EC assistance to candidate or pre-candidate countries; recalls that this is crucial in view of the entry into force of the new pre-accession instrument, which will consolidate into one single act a variety of geographical and thematic programmes; 18. Deplores the fact that several budget lines are too general in scope or couple regions and activities that are very different in nature without providing an appropriate breakdown of allocations, thus rendering budgetary planning and parliamentary scrutiny meaningless or impossible; 19. Regrets the Council's continuing delay in adopting the Community's aid package to the Turkish Cypriot community; recalls that the pilot project on de-mining activities in Cyprus (22 02 09) was discontinued after only one year in the expectation that such activities would be pursued under the new aid package; recalls that EUR 1.5 million were recently transferred in order to ensure that de-mining continues throughout 2005, thus allowing the gradual opening of new checkpoints between the two parts of the island; takes the view that these activities should continue until the aid package is finally approved; decides therefore to turn the pilot project into a preparatory action on de-mining activities in Cyprus with an allocation of EUR 1.5 million.
