in certain regions. They therefore invite the Commission to review, on the basis of Court of Justice case law, ways to enhance legal certainty for patients regarding their rights to use health services in another Member State, and to present appropriate proposals on the subject. They are concerned that in many Member States, waiting times for certain treatments are too long and call for Member States to take steps to reduce waiting times.

The House also regrets that the international forces did not intervene earlier, as called for by CARICOM, to put an end to the spiral of violence. MEPs call for the creation of a broad-based interim government of national unity. They also call for national reconciliation and calls on the transition authorities to consider holding a ‘national conference’ to debate the country’s future and seek a consensus on future action. The House demands that all parties to the conflict in Haiti cease using violent means, and reiterates that all parties must respect international law, including with respect to human rights, and that there will be individual accountability and no impunity for violators. Parliament calls on the transition authorities, with the help of the international forces, to disband all non-constitutional armed organisations, require them to hand in their weapons, put an end to corruption and step up the fight against drug trafficking with the assistance of specialised international agencies. MEPs call for the multinational interim force comprising French, US and Canadian military personnel to be replaced with United Nations peace-keepers on the date decided by the Security Council. The House welcomes the Commission emergency funding of 1.8 million euro but calls for EU and international aid to increase, in order not only to address humanitarian needs
