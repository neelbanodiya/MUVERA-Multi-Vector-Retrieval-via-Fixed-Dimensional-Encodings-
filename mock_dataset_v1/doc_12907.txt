Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (24 January 2012) The Atlantic Forum proposed by the Commission should provide concrete ideas for priority actions that could be implemented by the Atlantic Member States. It should also suggest projects and this can guide spending in operational programmes and boost the blue economy. The Outermost Regions (OR) have a natural advantage in terms of renewable energy production. The Atlantic Forum will explore the potential and allow stakeholders, including the OR, to propose actions and projects, including for energy production platforms or transmission networks. Information on EU funding for projects and calls for proposals, including those that affect the maritime economy, is made available through a number of sources. The Commission is considering options to provide better transparency on maritime projects that would cover a large number of different EU funding sources. As regards the Atlantic Forum, the priority actions and project proposals made by the Forum will be announced and made publicly available. The Commission will also ensure adequate follow up and reporting so that stakeholders can assess the extent to which project proposals are successful in response to specific calls for proposals. The Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency work closely with Member States and other stakeholders to prevent disasters at sea and deal with them effectively if they do occur. Maritime professions must be attractive as a lifelong career to young people in order to sustain ‘blue growth’. The Commission intends to convene a workshop on maritime employment and training in 2012. The results and recommendations will feed into the employment package being prepared by the Commission later in the year.
