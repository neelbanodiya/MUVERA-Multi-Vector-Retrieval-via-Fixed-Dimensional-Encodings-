ORAL QUESTION H-0017/05 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jonas Sjöstedt to the Council Subject: Storage of traffic data A framework decision concerning the storage of traffic data is currently being drafted within the EU. The issue has been raised previously and, each time, the Article 29 Group (the EU's data protection authority whose task is to ensure compliance with the rules on the protection of personal data) has delivered strongly critical opinions. The current draft proposes that the EU should introduce a common rule stipulating that data from 'publicly available communications services' should be stored for 12-36 months ' for the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of crime and criminal offences including terrorism'. The proposal is not confined to telephony; it also covers data traffic, i.e. information concerning websites visited and addresses to which e-mail has been sent. Furthermore, the proposal is not simply concerned with the investigation of crime but also with prevention; everyone is to be treated as a suspect. Naturally, the Article 29 Group has also sharply criticised this proposal. Their opinion states that the proposal is not only contrary to the rule that information may not be used for a purpose other than for which it is retained, it is also as a whole contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that 'Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.' Will the Council take measures in response to the Article 29 Group's criticism ?
