Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (9 December 2004) In September 2002, the Commission approved a contribution of € 32 million to fill the gap left by the United States’ Government withdrawal of funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The contribution, which was made available within the 8th European Development Fund (EDF) (intra-ACP funds) in full agreement with the African Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States, was allocated as follows: € 20 million to UNFPA projects, € 10 million to International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) projects and € 2 million to cover evaluation and audit costs. The 2002 contribution was considered as an exceptional one, as it was aimed to provide political and financial support for the implementation of the entire International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) agenda. In this respect, it should be noted that the Commission has always been fully supportive of the Programme of Action agreed at the ICPD in October 1994 and ICPD + 5 in 1999. In addition to the above mentioned contribution in 2002, the Commission has been providing financial assistance to implement programmes in partner countries in the field of sexual and reproductive health through a specific budget line of the Community budget, whose legal basis (Regulation (EC) No 1567/2003 Regulation (EC) No 1567/2003 of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on aid for policies and actions on reproductive and sexual health and rights in developing countries, OJ l 224, 6.9.2003 ) was approved on 15 July 2003. More specifically, a total amount of € 13.95 million was made available in 2003, € 17.80 million in 2004 and € 42 million has been planned for 2005 and 2006. The Commission intends to keep providing support to the implementation of the full Cairo agenda, including the provision of commodities. To this effect, the Commission is currently considering providing an ad hoc contribution to the UNFPA of € 15 million within the 9th EDF. The project proposal, aimed at providing reproductive health commodities and related technical assistance to ACP States affected by conflict and post-conflict situations, is currently under consideration by the ACP group.
