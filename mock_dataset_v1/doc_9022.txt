Question for written answer E-9292/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Elżbieta Katarzyna Łukacijewska (PPE) (11 November 2010) Subject: Efforts by the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to secure an exemption from Schengen area visa requirements In my capacity as a member of the Delegation for relations with the People's Republic of China, I should like to draw the Commission's attention to the following matter. The government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) has long been doing everything in its power to secure an exemption from the Schengen area visa requirements for Taiwanese nationals. The Commission adopted a proposal on this matter on 5 July 2010 (COM(2010)0358, 2010/0192(COD)). Under the applicable procedure, the matter will be referred to the national parliaments for consideration in accordance with the subsidiarity principle. If no reservations are voiced by the national parliaments, the proposal will return to the EU for the next stage in the scrutiny process. In connection with the above, what view does the Commission take of the outcome of the action taken by the government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) in this matter? What is the Commission's position on the matter? When will the matter be referred to Parliament?
