Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2012) The most recent EU‑wide statistics on crimes recorded by the police, compiled by Eurostat Statistics in focus 58/2010. , were published in 2010 and cover the period to 2008. The Commission agrees that social exclusion, poverty and unemployment are factors that can make people more vulnerable to being tempted into criminal activity or to becoming victims of crime. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the economic and financial crisis may have a negative impact on crime rates. The Commission remains convinced of the importance of identifying sources of social disorder and of developing approaches which foster social and economic cohesion in cities, including crime prevention measures and the integration of vulnerable groups. The EU Structural Funds therefore contribute to the development of many educational and employment initiatives in cities. In addition, the ISECProgramme ‘Prevention of and fight against crime’ (worth EUR 600 million for the period 2007‑13) contributes to tackling crime including terrorism, trafficking in persons, child abuse, cybercrime, illicit drug and arms trafficking, corruption and fraud. Stakeholders in Greece, like those in other Member States, can apply for financial support for actions that aim at increasing operational cooperation, monitoring and evaluation activities, the development and transfer of technology and methodology, training and exchanges of staff, as well as awareness-raising and dissemination activities.
