WRITTEN QUESTION E-3390/10 by Alain Cadec (PPE) to the Commission (14 May 2010) Subject: Industrial policy as part of the Europe 2020 strategy The Commission has put forward the Europe 2020 strategy ‘for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’. The strategy proposes action on a number of fronts to foster economic growth in the EU over the next decade. Among the Europe 2020 proposals that the Commission highlights is the flagship initiative on ‘an industrial policy for the globalisation era’. One of the aims here is to ‘develop a horizontal approach to industrial policy combining different policy instruments (e.g. “smart” regulation, modernised public procurement, competition rules and standard setting)’. Will the promotion of a horizontal approach to industrial policy be accompanied by sector-specific initiatives? While general improvement in the climate for industry is undoubtedly needed, certain strategic sectors (the automotive, electronics and aviation industries, for example) require more targeted measures. How does the Commission intend to link its horizontal approach to industrial policy with necessary sector-specific measures?
