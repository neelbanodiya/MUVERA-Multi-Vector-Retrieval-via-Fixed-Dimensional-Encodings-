Question for written answer E-8054/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jarosław Kalinowski (PPE) (11 October 2010) Subject: The law and tourist privileges within the EU The holiday season has either ended or is coming to a close in the EU countries. EU citizens have been travelling around all over Europe, taking advantage of the right to free movement. Unfortunately, this has also led to certain criminal justice issues cropping up, with procedural, legal and linguistic problems resulting from these. Chapter VI of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was signed in December 2000, guarantees EU citizens free access to defence, representation and the possibility of legal advice. The right of a suspect to be provided with accurate and reliable information is also of the utmost importance. Such information would relate to the suspect’s rights and any possible criminal proceedings. Police officers often use the language of their own country to bring charges against confused tourists (and anyone can inadvertently cause an accident or break the law). Tourists, however, are helpless if they cannot speak the language of the country concerned. Is the Commission preparing any proposals on this matter? Is it planning any provisions to ensure that tourists who may find themselves accused of a crime are entitled to information in relation to criminal justice issues, either in their mother tongue or in a language they know? Who will meet the costs of these translations?
