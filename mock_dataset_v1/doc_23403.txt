WRITTEN QUESTION E-1193/07 by Carlos Carnero González (PSE) and Elena Valenciano Martínez-Orozco (PSE) to the Commission (9 March 2007) Subject: Detention of the blogger Abdel Kareem Nabil Suleiman Following reports issued by Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty International, the media have published information concerning the arrest and the trial of Abdel Kareem Nabil Suleiman, an Egyptian national who writes blogs (http://karam903.blogspot.com and http://www2.blogger.com/profile/10055639386916201652). He was arrested last November in Egypt and he has now been given a four-year prison sentence: three years for having ‘attacked religion’ and one year for having ‘defamed the President’, Hosni Mubarak. Freedom of speech and freedom of thought are fundamental rights promoted by the EU, which must uphold them under the terms of the association agreements concluded with Mediterranean countries including Egypt. The Internet promotes freedom and it is proving to be a democratising factor throughout the world. An essential role in the promotion of fundamental rights and freedoms is being played by people who publish blogs on the Internet. As a promoter of democracy the EU cannot stand apart — it must support civil society. Will the Commission condemn these violations of fundamental rights and make enquiries of the Egyptian authorities regarding the detainee's situation? Will the EU's representations take any action to secure the release of — and provide protection for — Abdel Kareem Nabil Suleiman and others who are in a similar situation? What action is the Commission to take in order to ensure that freedom of speech through any medium (including blogs in Egypt) is upheld in all the countries with which the EU has concluded association agreements and in other parts of the world, too? What action has been and is to be taken by the Commission with a view to ensuring that freedoms are genuinely promoted in Egypt and in all Mediterranean countries?
