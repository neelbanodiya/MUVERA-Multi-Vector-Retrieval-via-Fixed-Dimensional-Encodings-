solution AR (d = 0,910 g/ml) and make up to 1 000 ml with water (or use the equivalent amount of ammonium tartrate AR). 3.2.9. Dilute ammonia solution: 40 ml ammonia solution AR (d = 0,910 g/ml) diluted to 1 000 ml with water. 3.2.10. Standard acetate buffer: dissolve 40 g solid sodium hydroxide AR, in 500 ml water in a beaker and allow to cool. Add 120 ml glacial acetic acid (3.2.7).

Copper sulphate solution (for standardisation of 3.2.11). STOCK SOLUTION Mix 1,249 g copper sulphate, CuSO 4 .5H 2 O AR, with 50 ml 0,5 M sulphuric acid and make up to 1 000 ml with water. STANDARD SOLUTION Mix 50 ml stock solution with 10 ml 0 , 5 M H 2 SO 4 and make up to 1 000 ml with water. 3.2.13. Sodium chloride AR. 3.2.14. Gas-stripping apparatus (see Figure 5). The diameter of the sintered disc must be the same as the internal diameter of the cylinder. 3.2.15. Separating funnel, 250 ml. 3.2.16. Magnetic stirrer with magnet 25-30 mm. 3.2.17. Gooch crucible, diameter of the perforated base = 25 mm, Type G4. 3.2.18. Circular glass-fibre filter papers, 27 mm diameter with fibre diameter 0,3-1,5 µm. 3.2.19. Two filter flasks with adapters and rubber collars, 500 and 250 ml respectively. 3.2.20. Recording potentiometer fitted with a bright platinum indicator electrode and a calomel or silver/silver chloride reference electrode with a 250 mV range, with automatic burette of 20-25 ml capacity, or alternative manual equipment. 3.3. Method 3.3.1. Concentration and separation of the surfactant Filter the aqueous sample through a qualitative filter paper. Discard the first 100 ml of the filtrate. Into the stripping apparatus, previously rinsed with ethyl acetate, place a measured quantity of the sample, such that it contains between 250-800 µg non-ionic surfactant. To improve the separation add 100 g sodium chloride and 5 g sodium bicarbonate. If the volume of the sample exceeds 500 ml, add these salts to the stripping apparatus in solid
