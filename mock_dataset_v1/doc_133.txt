WRITTEN QUESTION P-4754/07 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (26 September 2007) Subject: Health concerns over exposure to electromagnetic fields: response to Bio-lnitiative report As the Commission will be aware, on 31 August 2007 the international Bio-Initiative Working Group of renowned scientists and public health policy experts published a report called ‘A Rationale for a Biologically-Based Public Exposure Standard for Electromagnetic Fields (ELF and RF)’. This report documents evidence that ELFs are a risk factor for both childhood and adult cancers, and sets out how wireless technologies which rely on RF to send emails and voice communications are thousands of times stronger than levels reported to cause sleep disorders, headaches, problems with memory and concentration and other physical symptoms. It notes the unprecedented levels of exposure to ELFs being created by the ‘explosion of new sources’ and raises serious scientific concerns over the health risks posed by long-term and cumulative exposure. The report concludes that current safety limits regulating the levels of ELF permitted from power lines, mobile phones and other sources are highly inadequate, and that a much more cautious approach should be taken to further deployment of risky technologies. The European Environment Agency (EEA) contributed a chapter to the report, concerning the consequences of previous failures to apply the precautionary principle in the face of public and environmental hazards. Following publication of the study the EEA's Executive Director has publicly stressed the importance of precaution where potentially serious future consequences may be involved, and called for actions to reduce exposures to ELF, particularly where vulnerable groups are concerned. What action is the Commission taking in response to this report, its conclusions and endorsement by the EEA? Does the Commission agree that the balance of evidence points to the need to revise public safety standards regulating radiation levels from sources of day-to-day ELF exposure, as well as policies on the testing and deployment of new telecommunications technologies?
