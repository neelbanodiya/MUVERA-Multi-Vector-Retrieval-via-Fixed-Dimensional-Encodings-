Being the last year of FP6, commitments made during 2006 and previous years will have a payment impact on the budget for the coming 4-5 years. Payments are still being made for commitments under FP5. In view of the increased budget for FP7, there is a need to prepare the ground for new areas such as Space where a boost in investments is expected due to its increased role in conjunction with Security research. As far as Health is concerned, the decrease in commitments dedicated to the fight against diseases should be corrected. However, payments for this sector have increased.
