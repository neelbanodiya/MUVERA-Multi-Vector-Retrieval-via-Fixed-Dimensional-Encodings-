2002/C 205 E/082 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0130/02 by Stavros Xarchakos (PPE-DE) to the Commission (1 February 2002) Subject: Possible suspension of drug dependency programmes The Greek press reports that drug dependency programmes run by Ithaki, an EU-funded therapeutic community in northern Greece, may be suspended because, it appears, the staff's contracts have expired and, owing to an oversight while drugs legislation was being amended, no new recruitment can take place. Is the Commission aware of this matter? Is there a possibility that the programmes will be suspended? What action will the Commission take to prevent that eventuality? What funds has the EU provided, directly and indirectly, and to which therapeutic communities for drug addicts in Greece?
