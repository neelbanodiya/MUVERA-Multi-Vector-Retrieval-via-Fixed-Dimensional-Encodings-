WRITTEN QUESTION P-6492/07 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 January 2008) Subject: Delay in decision on interchange fee In connection with the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), from 1 January 2008 debit card payments in Belgium were to take place through a new payment scheme called Maestro. From that date, Maestro was to charge an interchange fee to small traders. However, the Commission has expressed doubts about the interchange fee. Commissioner Kroes has said that the introduction of SEPA must not lead the banking industry to raise prices or lower service quality. The success of SEPA in Belgium and other countries where electronic payment had become widely accepted and thus relatively cheap depended on a decision on the interchange fee. The higher its cost for traders, the less attractive it became for them and for the consumer. In the mean time, in May 2007 the Belgian banking sector suspended its decision on replacing the relatively cheap and efficient Bancontact/Mister Cash payment scheme with Maestro. Since then, all those affected have been awaiting a decision from the Commission. On 15 November 2007, however, the Commission deferred its decision on abolishing the interchange fee system. I should therefore like to ask the Commission why it has deferred its decision on the interchange fee. When does the Commission feel it will be able to clarify the picture on this matter which is so vital to consumers? In doing so, will it take account of the fact that SEPA has to be introduced in such a way that it encourages electronic payment rather than putting a brake on it?
