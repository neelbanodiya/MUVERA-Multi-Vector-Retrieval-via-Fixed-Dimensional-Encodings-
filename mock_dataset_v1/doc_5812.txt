Question for written answer E-009934/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (3 November 2011) Subject: High levels of bacteria on mobile phones A study carried out by a group of UK researchers has revealed the presence of strains of the Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in the grooves and between the keys of mobile phones. E. coli is not the only bacteria on mobile phones that can cause intestinal infections — Staphylococcus aureus has also been detected. Apparently, both are to be found on nine out of ten mobile phones and are transmitted to the phones mainly via users’ hands, which are often irregularly or poorly washed and come into contact with doors, public transport fittings and dirty toilets. Paradoxically, there are more bacteria — particularly E. coli — on mobile phones than on hands. This bacterium was the main cause of the recent epidemic in Germany, during which 11 people died. The UK study is not the first to have revealed the presence of bacteria on mobile phones, where it nests in the grooves of the keypad and is difficult to remove. These bacteria are difficult to wash off the surface of a mobile phone. They nest and continue to live there, and then transfer back to users’ skin and cause very serious illnesses. In light of this, does the Commission intend to raise public awareness of this issue, in order to prevent the spread of illnesses and infections which can be very serious?
