WRITTEN QUESTION E-5348/06 by Ana Maria Gomes (PSE) to the Council (7 December 2006) Subject: Mobility and citizens' rights Bearing in mind the free movement of persons in the European Union and the fact that the mobility of workers has become increasingly frequent and widespread, what measures has the Council taken and what further measures will it take to guarantee the rights of European Union citizens when making use of this mobility within the Union, in particular as regards: — equivalent rights as regards healthcare in the country of origin and the country of destination; — guaranteed healthcare for couples comprising spouses from two different EU countries in both countries of origin (including, for example, the right to give birth in the country of origin of one of the spouses even when their current official residence is in the country of origin of the other spouse); — possibility of benefiting from a ‘two homes, one legal system’ scheme (as is the case for legal persons) for spouses permanently resident in two different EU countries; — possibility of transferring rights accumulated throughout their career in various EU countries (social security benefits, pensions, private insurance, etc.), with cumulative advantages similar to those enjoyed by workers who did not exercise their right to mobility?
