aggregate and synergistic affects on human health, MRLs should be set after consultation of the European Food Safety Authority ("the Authority") established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority, and laying down procedures in matters of food safety OJ L 31, 1.2.2002, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1642/2003 (OJ L 245, 29.9.2003, p. 4). . ( 7 ) Directive 91/414/EEC provides that Member States, when issuing authorisations, are to prescribe that plant protection products be used properly. Proper use includes the application of the principles of good agricultural practice as well as the principles of integrated control. Where the MRLs arising from an authorised use of a pesticide under Directive 91/414/EEC present a risk to the consumer such use should be revised to decrease the levels of pesticide residues. The Community should encourage the use of methods or products favouring a reduction in risk, and the use of amounts of pesticides at levels consistent with efficient pest control. ( 8 ) A number of active substances are banned under Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances OJ L 33, 8.2.1979, p. 36.

At the same time, many other active substances are not currently authorised under Directive 91/414/EEC. The residues of active substances in products of plant and animal origin arising from unauthorised use or from environmental contamination or from use in third countries should be carefully controlled and monitored. ( 9 ) The basic rules with regard to food and feed law are laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002. ( 10 ) In addition to those basic rules, more specific rules are needed to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market and trade with third countries in relation to fresh, processed and/or composite plant and animal products intended for human consumption or animal feed in which pesticide residues may be present, whilst providing the basis for securing a high level of protection for human and animal health and the interests of consumers. Such rules should include the
