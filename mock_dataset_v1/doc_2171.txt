Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2011) The Commission appreciates encourages and supports cultural activities on a European level, including museums, within the framework of the EU's Culture Programme. Cultural operators that comply with the conditions for participation within the Programme can apply for EU co-funding for their project. Further to calls for proposals and an independent selection, best projects can be awarded a grant All the necessary information about our support in the cultural field (including a Programme guide detailing the conditions for participation, and the applications forms) is available at: http://ec.europa.eu/culture/index_en.htm . Supporting and increasing the collaboration between different museums and institutions in EU countries is one of the main objectives of the Culture Programme. Many museums, including in the forms of networks, are supported every year through this Programme. As its objectives and its general budget have been defined for the entire period 2007‑13, the funding opportunities offered to museums and other cultural organisations are going to remain unchanged until 2013. By the end of 2011, the Commission will present its proposals for a new programme in the field of culture after 2013.
