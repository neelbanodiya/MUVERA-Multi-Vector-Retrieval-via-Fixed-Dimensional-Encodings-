Reply (10 November 2008) In various declarations on the situation in Burundi, the Council of the European Union has constantly urged all political forces in Burundi to take steps to normalise the country's political life and improve the lives of all Burundians. In its conclusions of 16 and 17 June 2008, the Council recalled that the EU strongly encouraged the institutions in Burundi to resume work and engage in a constructive way, in order to improve the living conditions of the Burundian population. Human rights matters, such as the arrest of Mr Kavumbagu, are regularly raised in political dialogue under the Cotonou Agreement. Pursuant to Article 96 of that Agreement, in the event of failure to fulfil an obligation stemming from respect for human rights, the European Union is initially to step up political dialogue with the country concerned, with a view to remedying the situation. The forthcoming visit by the EU Special Representative for the Great Lakes region will thus provide an opportunity to raise this issue with Burundi's representatives.
