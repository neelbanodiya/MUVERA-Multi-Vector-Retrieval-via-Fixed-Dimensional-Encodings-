Staff Working Document Accompanying document to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the EU greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system, Impact Assessment {COM(2008)16 final}{SEC(2008)53}. Recital 10 of Directive 2009/29/EC notes that the EU ETS should be extended to other installations the emissions of which are capable of being monitored, reported and verified with the same level of accuracy as that which applies under the monitoring, reporting and verification requirements currently applicable. The Commission stresses the importance of considering not only individual activities but the land use, land use change and forestry sector as a whole, emissions and removals alike, to avoid partial accounting and preserve the environmental integrity of the EU's efforts to address climate change.
