Answer given by Mrs Grybauskaite on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2006) 1. The Commission has indicated in its follow up to the Resolution P6_TA-PROV(2006) 0277 — A6-0185/2006 . on protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud, 2004 Annual Report, addressed to the Parliament, that it will report to the Committee on Budgetary Control on this matter. Work is already under way and the report will probably be completed by 31 December 2006. 2. In the Commission, there are internal provisions specifying the relevant rules of the Financial Regulation and its Implementing Rules, which are mandatory for all Authorising officers. There are also various templates which have been prepared for the Authorising officers' use. 3. The Directorate Generals (DGs) of the Commission, its offices: Pay Master Office (PMO), Office for Infrastructure and Logistics (OIB/OIL) and Executive Agencies are responsible towards the College of the Commissioners for the implementation of the section of the General Budget attributed to the Commission. This includes the claims for recovery of community resources. They are not required to do so only above a certain percentage since the programmes managed by each authorising officer may differ from each other: from small grants attributed to students to large amounts transferred to Member States under shared management. 4 and 5. Detailed information has already been sent directly by the accounting officer of the Commission to the Honourable Member as far as direct management or recoveries towards Member States and international organisations are concerned. The amounts recovered are disclosed in the preliminary draft budget of 2006 (PDB) revenues COM(2005)300 final. and in the accounts for the year concerned. From 2005 onwards the Commission discloses in the accounts the recovery of expenses by management type — see Volume I, Section E4, Notes to the Economic Outturn Account, Table 4.1 (page 91). 6. Until August 2006, only three judgments have been ordered by the Court of Justice with regard to penalty payments imposed on Member States. Another judgment has been passed in 2003 but the Member State concerned eventually complied with Community law and no penalty has been claimed. Pursuant to these judgments, the Commission requested the payment of the following amounts which were all cashed at the due dates : Year of cashing Amount in euros Member State concerned Case No 2000 1760000 Greece C-387/97 2001 2960000 Greece C-387/97 2005 20000000 France C-304/02
