early to speculate on the precise content of the future common strategic framework for research and innovation funding, but the Commission is aware that developing new pharmaceutical products is a long-term endeavour. It is also worth noticing that the common strategic framework will have an increased focus on innovation and product development. The Commission is also aware that new effective tools to combat TB must be accompanied by effective strategies to deliver these tools. The statutes of the Global Fund prevent it from supporting research activities, but it can support the delivery of TB vaccines. It could therefore be explored whether activities supported by the Global Fund can be aligned with research activities, so that the best possible synergy can be attained. The Commission is aiming to support a comprehensive innovation system that can support the discovery and development of new products to combat TB, but also — and equally important — deliver them to the people that need them most. In line with this, the Commission has worked to support the establishment of the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) as well as the African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation (ANDI). Both of these initiatives include activities to bridge the gap between development and delivery of new pharmaceutical products to people in resource-poor settings.
