WRITTEN QUESTION P-1383/06 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (29 March 2006) Subject: Afghanistan and human rights We in the European Union cannot ignore the plight of Abdul Rahman, an Afghan citizen who converted to Christianity and who now faces the death penalty in Kabul for apostasy. A country which sentences a man to death for the simple reason that he has become a Christian cannot be considered to respect human rights or to be democratic. 1. Following the diplomatic action taken by the Italian Government, what measures does the Commission intend to take to protect these rights and ensure that Abdul Rahman is not executed? 2. Does it not consider that immediate action must be taken to remind the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities as free human beings, following the defeat of the Taliban extremists, who systematically trampled these rights underfoot?
