WRITTEN QUESTION E-5704/06 by Adriana Poli Bortone (UEN) to the Commission (5 January 2007) Subject: Love FM activities The receivers and transmitters used in air navigation operate on radio frequencies allocated by law at international level (VHS omnidirectional range), ranging between 108.00 and 117.95 MHz, at 50 kHz intervals. Under ITU (1984 Geneva Conference) and ICAO rules, the 108.00 MHz frequency is internationally reserved for civil and military air radio navigation. In Corato (Bari, Italy), a private radio station (Love FM) broadcasts on the same frequency (108.00 MHz) as the national flight assistance company (ENAV), causing serious interference with the ILS and VOR systems. At the time of writing (27 November 2006), this radio transmitter is still in operation and is still causing difficulties and disruptions in air radio navigation. Will the Commission state whether it is aware of this and what measures it plans to take — hopefully without delay — to resolve this serious infringement which is disturbing air radio navigation on a daily basis?
