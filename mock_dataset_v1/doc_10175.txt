Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (17 May 2011) 1. The Commission does not consider that the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations are in breach of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. The EU, when implementing such recommendations will ensure respect for WTO obligations, in particular the obligations enshrined in the Agreement. 2. The main objective of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is to protect present and future generations from the health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption. Both the EU and 26 Member States are contracting parties to this Convention. The Convention recognises that price and tax measures are an effective means of reducing tobacco consumption and states that each contracting party determines and establishes its taxation measures, taking into account its national health objectives regarding tobacco control. 3. As regards the common agricultural policy, a result of the reform of the sector in 2004, tobacco aid has been decoupled and fully integrated in the single payment scheme which is a direct income support granted to farmers without any production obligation. In this respect, tobacco is not treated differently from other agriculture production. The economic and social implications of any structural changes in tobacco production will be considered.
