WRITTEN QUESTION E-5052/06 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (23 November 2006) Subject: Implementation of the ‘N+2’ rule for 2006 In reply to my previous Question (E‑0583/06) concerning implementation of the ‘N+2’ rule for 2005, the Commission indicates that the extent of the exemptions granted for 2004 and 2005 will have the effect of increasing the effort required to permit the full use of Structural Fund appropriations under the CSF for Greece in the years ahead. In view of this: 1. How does the Commission evaluate the results of implementing the rule concerning the automatic decommitment of unused appropriations (N+2 rule) in Greece for 2006 regarding all operational programmes and actions under the third CSF? 2. To what extent and to what amount have applications for exemptions accorded in previous years adversely affected implementation of this rule?
