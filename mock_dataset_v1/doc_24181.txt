Solidarity in crisis situations 31. Considering that solidarity and energy security are necessary for the smooth functioning of the internal market, including equal access to energy for all economic operators, calls on the Council and the Member States to create a solidarity mechanism, in accordance with the spirit of solidarity between Members States referred to in the new Reform Treaty agreed upon by the European Council in June 2007, which would allow the EU to act efficiently, swiftly and coherently in crisis situations caused by disruption of supply, damage to critical infrastructure or any other event; 32. Calls on the Commission to support the so-called "energy security clause" to be included in trade, association, and partnership and cooperation agreements with producer and transit countries, which would lay down a code of conduct and explicitly outline measures to be taken in the event of disruption, or any unilateral change in the terms of the contract or in the terms of supply by one of the partners; 33. Supports the creation of an efficient mechanism, to include NESCO, with which to react in the event of supply disruptions, including measures to make effective use of warning systems and build up an interconnecting EU energy crisis infrastructure, especially for gas and electricity, which could be used to assist Member States in need, taking into account the geological and geographic features of those Member States, particularly as regards storage capacities and their proximity to sources of energy supply; D. Strengthened cooperation with major producer, transit and consumer countries 34. Calls on the EU and the Member States to further engage actively in a close dialogue between the EU and all major producer, transit and consumer countries and, in particular, to step up relations in the energy sector with Algeria, Egypt and the other producer countries in the Mashreq/Maghreb region; encourages those countries to fulfil their international commitments and to adhere to international law; 35. Supports all steps aimed at promoting transparency, the rule of law and improved governance in the energy sector through energy partnerships with third countries, with the objective of creating mutually beneficial, open, transparent, non-discriminatory and stable legal conditions for access to upstream assets and for energy investment and trade, to be based on the principle of reciprocity and fair and transparent competition, ensuring that the income from energy trading will not be misused and diverted to finance terrorism; 36.
