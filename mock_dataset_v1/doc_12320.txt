WRITTEN QUESTION E-2999/10 by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Economic repercussions of the Eyjafjalla volcano crisis Following the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjalla, the European air transport sector was plunged into an unprecedented crisis which led to the cancellation of 84 000 flights in five days. These cancellations have had economic, social and work-related consequences which raise very serious questions as to the overall organisation of the European transport system and concepts such as intermodality, complementarity and interoperability. From an economic perspective, we would like to ask the Commission: When will an estimate of the economic losses caused by the volcanic eruption be made? Are there estimates of how many passengers were affected by the flight cancellations and of the impact the cancellations had on other sectors of the economy? Is there a way of calculating how much aid the airlines affected by the crisis are to receive? How will this aid be financed? Can we expect the cost of airline tickets to rise or air transport taxes to be increased? Would the Commission consider it wise to make the granting of aid conditional on guarantees from the airlines that they will respect the rights of passengers affected by the flight cancellations? Will the amount of time it takes for passengers to be reimbursed for cancelled flights be monitored? Will a deadline be set, and made public, for the payment of these monies so as to minimise the economic impact on passengers?
