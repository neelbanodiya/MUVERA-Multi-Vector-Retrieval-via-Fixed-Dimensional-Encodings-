Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (19 April 2002) The Commission is fully aware of the importance of sea angling and its contribution to the wellbeing of certain coastal areas. However, the Commission believes that sea angling, in general terms, would be best managed by Member States, on the basis of their proximity to the activity and the general absence, in many cases, of a clear transnational dimension to this activity. However, this does not mean that the Community should overlook such activity. In some cases, it is clear that angling may have a Community dimension, for example where the species being caught are already managed by the Community or in other cases where anglers' contribution to the fishing mortality of certain fish stocks may be non negligible. In such cases, the Commission believes that Community intervention may be necessary and Member States may be required to take measures in respect of sea angling that reflect Community policy needs. As to the question of participation of anglers in the Community's decision making process, the Honourable Member will be aware that the enhancement of the participation of stakeholders is one of the priorities in the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. In that context, and in as much as the Commission takes initiatives on sea angling or on fisheries in which they have a major interest, anglers' associations will certainly be consulted as a fundamental stakeholder in this activity.
