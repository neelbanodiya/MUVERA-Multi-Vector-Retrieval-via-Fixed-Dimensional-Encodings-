Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (3 April 2007) The Honourable Member refers to the execution by the Danish authorities of the European Court of Justice's judgment of 15 September 2005 Judgment of the ECJ of 15 September 2005, Case C‑464/02 Commission v Denmark, ECR 2005 p. I‑7929 in Case C‑464/02. The Court held in this judgment that Denmark failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 39 EC in so far as: — its legislation and administrative practice did not allow workers resident in Denmark and employed in another Member State in work which is not their principal employment to use for business or private purposes a company vehicle registered in that other Member State where the undertaking of their employer is established, and — its legislation and administrative practice allowed employees resident in Denmark and employed in another Member State to use for business purposes or business and private purposes a company vehicle registered in that other Member State in which their employer had its registered office or principal establishment, the vehicle neither being intended to be essentially used in Denmark on a permanent basis nor being actually so used, only subject to the condition that the employment with that employer is their main employment and that a tax is paid for that purpose. The Court decided therefore that Denmark is entitled, in order to treat equally the use of a company car by frontier workers in question and other residents of Denmark, to impose a registration tax on a company vehicle made available to a frontier worker if this vehicle is intended to be, or is essentially used in Denmark on a permanent basis. The Court did not provide however any more specific criteria on how to assess whether a car is intended to be used ‘essentially’ in Denmark on a ‘permanent’ basis. Following the Court's judgment, the Danish authorities adopted the measures (Act No 519 of 7 June 2006 amending the Registration Tax Act) intended to comply with this judgment. This legislation introduces two cumulative criteria in order to evaluate whether company vehicle is intended to be used essentially in Denmark on a permanent basis: a day criterion and a kilometre criterion. The Commission analysed the text of this legislation and came to the conclusion that the criteria proposed by the Danish authorities seem to be, in the absence of more specific guidelines
