Consensus on Humanitarian Aid; 32. Stresses the need to intensify the Commission's consultations with civil society partners in headquarters and in the field through better-structured meetings on policy, strategic programming and aid effectiveness issues including requirements for calls for proposals, disbursement procedures, financial control of projects, monitoring and evaluation processes; calls on donors and partner governments to ensure the full and meaningful participation of civil society and local authorities in the planning, implementation, monitoring and assessment of development budgets and programmes and to support the conditions that are necessary to fulfil their roles; 33. Stresses that the involvement of women and women’s movements in the formulation and delivery of policy and programmes, implementation, monitoring and evaluation should be seen as an integral part of ensuring real ownership, given the disproportionate impact of poverty on women; 34.

Recalls the decisive role which can be played by members of diasporas in improving the effectiveness of European aid and therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to involve them more in planning and implementing European development programmes; stresses that the involvement of foreigners or people of foreign origin in a partnership between the EU and their country of origin is a powerful factor of integration; 36. Considers that increasing transparency of information on aid flows is a critical objective for improving the effective use of aid and mutual accountability, and ensuring that there is timely public dissemination of complete information on all aid committed, allocated and disbursed, including publishing reliable country-by-country timetables, for aid commitments and expenditure; that there is automatic, timely and proactive disclosure by Member States and partners of all documents related to the planning, execution and evaluation of aid strategies and projects; and that this disclosure should include publication of information that permits public participation in decision-making, in languages and forms that are appropriate for the stakeholders concerned; 37. Calls on the Commission and the Members States to make progress in this area by supporting the establishment of accounting standards for disclosure requirements in respect of external assistance and by working with civil society organisations, national parliaments, local authorities and international organisations to set out good practice in recording
