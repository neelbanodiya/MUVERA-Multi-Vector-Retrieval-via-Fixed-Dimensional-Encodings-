Reply (25 February 2009) The Council has noted the strategic importance of security and development in the Sahel‑Saharan region, particularly in Mauritania, Mali and Niger. It has pointed to the importance of the Sahel countries themselves taking charge of security and development issues and of greater regional cooperation between the countries concerned on such matters. The Council has also noted the advisability of following regional initiatives such as the Bamako regional conference on security and development and the need to support them. In this connection the Council has approved the principle of launching a suitable dialogue between the EU and the countries concerned, in a form and manner to be determined in due course. The Council is not at this stage able to gauge whether the insurgency in Niger is likely to threaten national or regional stability.
