WRITTEN QUESTION E-6353/07 by Cristobal Montoro Romero (PPE‑DE) to the Council (17 December 2007) Subject: Industrial relocation from the euro area to the dollar area According to the decision taken by EADS (and announced to the press on 4 December), part of the company's production is to be relocated to the dollar zone. The company chairman — Louis Gallois — maintains that the decision is in response to the difficulties being experienced by a range of industries on account of a ‘free-fall dollar’ policy, and that there is a political dimension to the problem. The appreciation of the euro is leading European industry into a serious competitiveness crisis. What view does the Council take of this matter? Is it concerned at the EADS chairman's decision to relocate some of his company's production on account of an overvalued euro? Is it not scandalous that the euro should cause part of Europe's manufacturing sector (in which, in this particular case, there is public interest in the background) to be moved elsewhere?
