Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (15 September 2006) The Commission is aware of the difficulties drivers might be faced with when changing the headlamp bulbs of certain cars. Therefore, the Commission, together with some Member States, has insisted on an amendment to the European type-approval Council Directive 76/756/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles and their trailers OJ L 262, 27.9.1976. , as well as an amendment to the equivalent United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN/ECE) Regulation 48. It is now required that replaceable light sources have to be designed in a way that they can be inserted in, and removed from, the holder of its device without tools. This provision is meant to ensure that it is no longer necessary to loosen a front bumper, or execute other technical operations, before a broken headlamp bulb can be changed. The Commission is in the process of evaluating, together with the European type-approval authorities, whether the abovementioned provision has indeed led to a substantial improvement in the situation. If further action is deemed necessary, the Commission will work on further amendments to the respective technical requirements without delay. Nevertheless, it should be noted that some vehicle manufacturers have already introduced technical measures to their vehicles, which make immediate replacement of a broken light bulb obsolete. Changing a light bulb on a motorway hard shoulder or at the side of a rural street in the dark is always a dangerous situation. Such vehicles are equipped with a system that, in the event of a problem with a driving light, switches automatically to a substitute light source (e.g. the fog lamp) until the defective lamp can be changed safely.
