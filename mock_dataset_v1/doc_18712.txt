WRITTEN QUESTION E-4483/09 by Saïd El Khadraoui (S-D) to the Commission (25 September 2009) Subject: Ferry route across the Strait of Gibraltar I was recently made aware of an anomalous situation relating to the ferry routes across the Strait of Gibraltar. The price of the ferry crossings increases every year despite falling fuel prices. The fares are also disproportionately high in comparison with other ferry routes. The Tarifa‑Tanger crossing costs as much as the Almeria-Nabor crossing, although the latter is far greater in distance and the crossing lasts seven hours. The (single) fare for the Tarifa-Tanger crossing is EUR 200 for a vehicle and four passengers, whereas the return fare between Ostend and Dover is only EUR 28. Do these ferries fall within the scope of European competition law? How is it possible for such great price differences to exist in a free market? And is the Commission aware of this situation? Could this be looked upon as price fixing?
