2004/C 70 E/223 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3056/03 by Dorette Corbey (PSE) to the Commission (17 October 2003) Subject: Measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply On 23 September 2003 Parliament voted on the Commission proposals concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply and security of supply for petroleum products. By means of both proposals the Commission is endeavouring to strengthen control over these energy sources. Parliament voted by an absolute majority to refer the proposal concerning security of supply for petroleum products back to the Commission and adopted substantial amendments to the proposal on measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply. 1. Can the Commission state how the Netherlands were consulted during the process of drafting the proposal on gas supply? 2. Can the Commission state how the fundamental interests of the Netherlands, the EU's largest natural gas producer, were taken into account in the proposal concerning natural gas supply? 3. Given the substantial similarities between the two proposals, does the Commission intend to withdraw both following the vote in Parliament?
