proposals for a solvency regime for IORPs must recognise the specificities of pensions, bearing in mind that risks in the insurance sector are different from those faced by IORPs, in particular as regards the conditionality of pension rights, the duration of pension portfolios and the fact that IORPs are special-purpose vehicles operating a homogenous product portfolio; stresses that the key aim of such a regime would be to provide enhanced protection to current and future pensioners; believes that the impact of such proposals needs to be fully assessed, in particular with a view to quantifying the additional costs and administrative burden; believes that any revision of a solvency regime for IORPs should be carried out within the framework of the existing IORP Directive; stresses that addressing the questions related to a capital requirements regime for pension funds is closely linked to adequate resolution of the issues concerning Article 8 of the Insolvency Directive; 51. Stresses, in line with the Commission’s statement in the Green Paper, that the IORP Directive is based on a Solvency I minimum harmonisation approach, whereas, in the near future, insurance undertakings will apply the risk-based Solvency II regime even for their occupational pension activity; 52. Stresses that financial markets can function efficiently only when there is confidence and trust and considers that confidence and trust require solid prudential rules for financial institutions, and that IORPs should be no exception to this; 53. Calls on the Commission to develop proposals on decision-making in relation to the IORPs’ solvency regime and notably – in line with its declared intention in the Green Paper – to launch an impact study on application of a Solvency-II-type solvency regime as soon as possible; EU LEGISLATION ON INSOLVENCY 54. Takes good note of the wide variety in implementation and application of the Insolvency Directive; observes that, while the relevant legislative provisions may be fairly adequate, the results can be inadequate and thus at odds with the Directive’s aim; refers to the Commission’s conclusion that, in certain cases concerning the implementation of the obligations imposed by Article 8 of the Directive, issues can be raised as regards the extent to which some of these measures are sufficient to protect the interests of employees and retired persons in the event of insolvency of the employer and that a number of issues need to be addressed; 55. Calls on the Commission to follow the implementation
