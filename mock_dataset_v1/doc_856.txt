debate, Parliament's rapporteur on the proposed Intervention Teams, Belgian Liberal Gérard Deprez, said that "it's about organising assistance to those facing a sudden and massive arrival of illegal immigrants...today this problem concerns southern EU members, but nobody can exclude that other, especially south-eastern or eastern borders, will tomorrow face similar sudden and recurrent pressures". Mr Deprez believes that RABIT could be operational by early 2008. Voting on Thursday the house supported a first reading agreement with the Council by an overwhelming majority. "Mandatory solidarity" between countries At the insistence of Mr Deprez the principle of "mandatory solidarity" was inserted in the text. This means that all EU countries would be obliged to help in the deployment of the specially trained guards if Frontex requested them to do so. Their mandate would be to act only if a country faces "urgent and exceptional pressure" on its frontiers. This point is particularly relevant to the countries in the Schengen area who have abolished internal border controls - so illegal immigrants entering the Schengen area could in theory travel unchecked. The resolution notes: "border control is in the interest not only of the Member State at whose external borders it is carried out but of all Member States which have abolished internal border control". However, as long as living standards in Europe remain high, the urge of many to risk their lives for a better life will continue. 20070502STO06195 Press Info on the vote Resolution 26 April Immigration: common approach needed 9 February Frontex homepage EN 1 PHOTO 20070502PHT06269.jpg EN 5 LINK http://www.frontex.europa.eu/ -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070420IPR05693 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT TA P6-TA-2007-0162 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//TEXT IM-PRESS 20070207STO02857 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 STO DOC XML V0//EN
