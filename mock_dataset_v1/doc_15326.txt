Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (31 March 2005) The Commission shares the Honourable Member's opinion that the tourism sector plays an important role in the European Union and contributes to the achievement of its economic, environmental and social goals. The tourism sector is very heterogeneous and incorporates a number of actors, such as hotels and similar establishments, campsites, restaurants, cafes, bars, tour operators, travel agencies and others, with different characteristics and needs. In the past it has proven to be difficult to create a specific budget line for such a heterogeneous sector. Nevertheless, a number of existing financial instruments and budget lines (Structural Funds, Research Programmes, Multiannual Programme for Enterprises and Entrepreneurship, etc.) can provide support to any tourism initiative of a European dimension. In order to facilitate the access of the tourist sector to EU funding, the European Commission has published on the Europa website a comprehensive and structured overview of various EU programmes, schemes, funds, initiatives and actions of potential interest for the tourism sector: http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/services/tourism/index_en.htm. As far as the new Financial Perspectives 2007-2013 are concerned, the Commission has not proposed the creation of a specific budget heading to support the tourism sector but a number of the instruments will continue to provide support to this important sector.
