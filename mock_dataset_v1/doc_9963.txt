Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (27 May 2008) On the basis of the information available, it seems unlikely that the 365 redundancies from Relacom could qualify for European Globalisation Fund (EGF) assistance. Even though the EGF Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, OJ L 406, 30.12.2006. makes allowances for the special circumstances applying in small labour markets, these circumstances would not seem to apply in this particular case. However, they can participate in the programmes financed by the European Social Fund (ESF) and managed by national authorities. It is worth mentioning that the Finnish authorities have developed a method to tackle this kind of situation of mass redundancies. The practices were developed in the context of the closure of the Kymmene factories in Voikkaa and further used in the context of closure of the Stora-Enso pulp mill in Kemijärvi. These actions are nationally funded and, when possible, EGF funding can support the actions. According to the data collected by the European Restructuring Monitor (ERM) managed by the Dublin Foundation, it is estimated that 69 667 jobs have so far been lost in 2008 as a result of restructuring. However, according to the same data collection, an estimated 81 882 new jobs have been created during the same period.
