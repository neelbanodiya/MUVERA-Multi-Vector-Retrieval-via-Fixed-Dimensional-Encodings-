9999/C Q999 E/103 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1112/04 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (31 March 2004) Subject: Expiry of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement Following the expiry of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement a number of issues were raised by Portuguese fishermen's organisations at a recent meeting, including unfair competition on the part of Morocco as regards minimum fish size and quotas, which it does not respect in particular with regard to swordfish, and the fact that it unloads hundreds of lorries in Algeciras even though it has no quota. Another problem is that it is impossible to set up joint enterprises with Morocco in the absence of a fisheries agreement. Since this situation is creating serious problems for Portuguese fishermen, can the Commission say: 1. what steps will be taken to control the marketing of fish and prevent EU Member States from importing species which do not meet minimum size and quota requirements; 2. when Article 70 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2369/2002 OJ L 358, 31.12.2002, p. 49 . of 20 December 2002 will be amended in order to allow the creation of joint enterprises with Morocco?
