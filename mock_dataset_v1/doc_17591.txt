of the existing multiannual programmes which function well, have a remarkable impact and meet high demand from stakeholders. However, the budget allocated for the Lisbon strategy is too focused on traditional policies like Rural Development and Structural Actions while we need to pay more attention to research and innovation. The EP have to put more emphasis on financing sectors such as health, energy, transport and ICT where there is a clear European added value. There is a need to give a strong signal on these themes in order to reverse the tendency in the present discussions on the Financial Perspectives towards a cut in research spending. To support this strategy, your draftsperson proposes to use, to the maximum, available funds within the budget ceiling (Commitments € 167 million for internal policies, Payments € 6700 million for the entire PDB), being aware of the very limited amounts set aside for commitments as opposed to payments. There are six policy areas within the budgetary remit of ITRE: o Title 01 Economic and Financial affairs o Title 02 Enterprise o Title 06 Transport and Energy o Title 08 Research o Title 09 Information society o Title 10 Direct Research Title 01 Economic and Financial affairs Commitments = € 56 million, Payments = € 71,8 million Commitments have been reduced by almost 30% compared to 2005, however payments have increased by 13 % compared to the same year. Title 02 Enterprise Commitments = € 396,4 million, Payments = € 423,6 million Encourage competitiveness; facilitate access to R&D, preparation of “innovation networks” for SMEs (MAP – Multi Annual Programme) The strategy for 2006 mirrors the priorities of the Commission and builds on the policy in previous years: to create the conditions in Europe for dynamic and sustainable growth in order to create new and better employment. In this respect, there are no major changes compared to 2005, however there is a decrease compared to 2005 on innovation competitiveness, especially in respect of SMEs. No commitment credits are requested for 2006 for the action “Cooperation and re-grouping of SMEs”. The credits requested for the MAP and Innovation Programmes correspond to the residual budget of these programmes.
