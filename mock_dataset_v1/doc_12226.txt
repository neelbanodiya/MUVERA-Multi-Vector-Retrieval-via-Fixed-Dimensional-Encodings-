the IMO and the Basel Convention as well as in the Joint Working Group of those organisations to establish a system of binding international rules which guarantee that ship recycling is done worldwide in a safe and environmentally sound manner. Several proposals, including the establishment of a ship reporting system, making certain parts of the guidelines on ship recycling binding and the establishment of a voluntary fund are currently under discussion in the IMO. The Joint Working Group met for the first time in January 2005 and started its discussion on these proposals. The Commission participates in this group as an observer. In July there will be a meeting of the Basel Convention Open Ended Working Group and a meeting of the IMO MEPC Maritime Environment Protection Committee. where the discussion on ship recycling will be continued. As regards capacities for ship recycling, the Commission is aware of the projects in some Member States to build new and well-qualified facilities for this purpose. In addition, it is however important to work towards ensuring that recycling facilities in developing countries meet the standards of environmentally sound management and occupational safety and health.
