on 17 July 2008, and having due regard for the IIA of 17 May 2006 in respect of the adoption of decisions to mobilise the EGF, D. whereas Greece has requested assistance in respect of a case concerning 642 redundancies in two enterprises in the retail sector (‘supermarket and supplier’) operating in the regions of Central Macedonia and Attica where the greatest number of ALDI stores were located. Smaller numbers of ALDI redundancies also occurred in other Greek regions, such as Eastern Macedonia-Thrace, Western Macedonia, Epirus, Western Greece, Sterea Ellada and Peloponnese. Of the 642 redundancies, 554 occurred during the reference period, and 88 occurred before the reference period, but are eligible for assistance according to Article 3a(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. All 642 redundant workers are targeted for EGF assistance, E. whereas the application fulfils the eligibility criteria laid down by the EGF Regulation, 1. Requests the institutions involved to make the necessary efforts to improve procedural and budgetary arrangements in order to accelerate the mobilisation of the EGF; appreciates in this sense the improved procedure put in place by the Commission, following Parliament's request for accelerating the release of grants, aimed at presenting to the budgetary authority the Commission's assessment on the eligibility of an EGF application together with the proposal to mobilise the EGF; hopes that further improvements in the procedure will be made within the framework of the upcoming review of the EGF and that greater efficiency, transparency and visibility of the EGF will be achieved; 2. Recalls the institutions' commitment to ensuring a smooth and rapid procedure for the adoption of the decisions on the mobilisation of the EGF, providing one-off, time-limited individual support geared to helping workers who have been made redundant as a result of globalisation and the financial and economic crisis; emphasises the role that the EGF can play in the reintegration of workers made redundant into the labour market, in particular the most vulnerable and least qualified workers; 3. Stresses that, in accordance with Article 6 of the EGF Regulation, it should be ensured that the EGF supports the reintegration of individual redundant workers into employment; further stresses that the EGF assistance can co-finance only active labour market measures which lead to long-term employment; reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures
