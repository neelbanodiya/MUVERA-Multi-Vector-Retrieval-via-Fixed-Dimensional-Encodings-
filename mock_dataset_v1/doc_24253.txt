WRITTEN QUESTION E-6069/07 by Stavros Arnaoutakis (PSE) to the Commission (7 December 2007) Subject: Dangerous algae in the sea around Crete The appearance of tropical algae, Caulerpa Racernosa , has been observed in sea areas around Crete and, in particular, off Messara and Chania. According to reports, these algae, which thrive on the sandy sea bottom, are modifying the ecosystem, resulting in reduced stocks of striped and red mullet, which are being driven away. According to the findings of the Greek Marine Research Centre, the algae began to appear after 2003, entering the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. It is not known whether and to what extent the tropical species of algae evidently accompanying the tropical fish species entering the eastern Mediterranean will adversely affect fish populations over and above all existing factors which are already limiting stocks. Can the Commission provide the following information: 1. Is it aware of the problem and has it already, in cooperation with the local authorities, begun to investigate possible countermeasures? 2. What measures are immediately necessary, with a view to at least containing the problem? 3. Has the invasion of tropical algae and fish been the subject of a specific study covering the entire Mediterranean and the resulting impact on the marine ecosystem?
