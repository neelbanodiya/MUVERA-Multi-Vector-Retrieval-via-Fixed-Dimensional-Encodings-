Climate change is the other challenge to which we must rise. Underpinning the fight against rises in temperature, LIFE+ provides financial support for new technologies, in particular those designed to achieve energy efficiency. In this area, LIFE+ should support the innovative measures which European citizens wish to see. Conclusion Your rapporteur invites the members of the European Parliament to support her proposals for second reading amendments. With the help of the LIFE+ instrument, we must remain focused on the importance of the environment to the European project. The environment is the only reference point which citizens have in the face of a lack of direction in Europe and the calling into question of Community institutions.
