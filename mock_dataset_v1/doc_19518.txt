WRITTEN QUESTION E-2070/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (30 March 2009) Subject: Information on the use of funds from the Daphne II programme by the province of Florence For the Community programming period 2007‑13 numerous financing programmes have been developed through which the EU intends to support projects under the various sectoral policies. The province of Florence (Tuscany, Italy) requires funding which would enable it to take measures to prevent and combat violence against children, young people and women, thereby helping to achieve the general EU objectives in this sector. In this regard, could the Commission say whether the province of Florence has submitted any projects under the Daphne II programme? If it has, could the Commission say whether the province of Florence has obtained any financing and if it has been used in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether the subsidies had to be reimbursed?
