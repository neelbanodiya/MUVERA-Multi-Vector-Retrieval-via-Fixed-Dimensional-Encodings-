Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2008) The European Union follows very closely the issue raised by the Honourable Member. On 26 September 2008, the Presidency published a Declaration on behalf of the European Union on the situation of people belonging to religious minorities in Iran. The Declaration makes a specific reference to the arrests of Iranian converts to Christianity. It also expresses the EU's concern at the Iranian Parliament's decision to consider a draft law making apostasy one of the crimes punishable by death. If adopted, that law would be a serious infringement of the freedom of religion or belief, which includes the right to change religion and the right to have no religion. It would violate Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was freely ratified by Iran, and would threaten the lives of a number of Iranians who have been arrested and held without trial for several months on account of their religious beliefs. Moreover, on 6 October 2008, in its capacity as EU Presidency, the French Foreign Ministry summoned the Iranian Ambassador in Paris to express the concern of the EU about a series of human rights cases in Iran, including the issue of Christian converts, and the draft law on apostasy. The EU will continue to monitor the issue very closely. Without a concrete improvement of the human rights situation, the EU's common objective of developing the relationship between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot proceed properly.
