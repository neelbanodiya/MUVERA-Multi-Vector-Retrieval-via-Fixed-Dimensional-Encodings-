WRITTEN QUESTION E-1913/08 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (9 April 2008) Subject: Introduction of MON810 genetically modified maize in Hessen, Germany The cultivation of MON810 genetically modified maize is due to begin this year in Rauischholzhausen and Wittelsberg, Hessen, among other places. 1. Is the Commission aware of the monitoring plan which the Monsanto company has submitted to the German Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL)? 2. Has the Federal Government notified Brussels of this plan? 3. What is the Commission’s view of the fact that Monsanto has stated its intention to use for the continuous monitoring various existing networks (e.g. those used for observing birds, bees and wild animals) which, according to experts, are not suitable for recording the damage which might be caused by the cultivation of genetically modified maize? 4. What is the Commission’s view of the fact that neither Germany nor any other Member State has developed widely-accepted testing methods which have passed interlaboratory tests to monitor the introduction of Bt toxins into the environment, with the result that the crucial scientific basis for the measures called for by the BVL is lacking? 5. In view of this, does the Commission consider the continuous monitoring of the cultivation of genetically modified maize in Germany to be adequate?
