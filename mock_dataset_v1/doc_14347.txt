Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (13 February 2012) As indicated in the 2012 Work Plan of the EU Health programme, the Commission intends to support action to improve access to healthcare services, health promotion and prevention to meet the needs of migrants in the EU Member States. The funding possibilities for action aimed at providing healthcare under the four funds of the General Programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’ 2007-2013 are indicated in the Commission’s reply to parliamentary Question E‑10318/2010 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp?&language=EN . No specific amount is earmarked for the implementation of such actions, since Member States are primarily responsible both for the implementation and the selection of actions. However, under the European Refugee Fund emergency measures for 2011, Greece planned the implementation of an action, estimated at approximately EUR 2 million, involving the provision of medical and psychosocial support to persons in need of international protection. Communicable diseases potentially linked to population flows are addressed by Decision No 2119/98/EC http://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexapi!prod!CELEXnumdoc&lg=EN&numdoc=31998D2119&model=guicheti of the Parliament and the Council which establishes a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community and an early warning and response system for the prevention and control of such diseases. A new proposed legal framework http://ec.europa.eu/health/preparedness_response/docs/hsi_decision_en.pdf has been adopted by the Commission in December 2011 and is intended to help national governments to jointly procure pandemic vaccines, increase preparedness levels and coordinate responses to all types of serious cross-border public-health threats.
