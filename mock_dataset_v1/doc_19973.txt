Question for written answer E-006733/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Angelika Werthmann (NI) (13 July 2011) Subject: Energy Taxation Directive COM(2011)0169 — costs to farmers The objective of the Commission proposal COM(2011)0169 is to reduce CO 2 emissions in Europe through a CO 2 ‑related component in the taxation of energy products. This is to be welcomed. Should the Commission draft be implemented from 2013, this would have significant implications for prices for energy products. To what extent has the Commission calculated, prior to submitting its draft proposal, what financial implications the implementation of the proposal would have for an average small farm (family‑run farm)/medium-sized agricultural holding per year? Given the sometimes very different current rates of taxation, could the Commission please give calculations by way of an example for an average small farm (family‑run farm)/medium‑sized agricultural holding in the following countries: Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Great Britain and Spain?
