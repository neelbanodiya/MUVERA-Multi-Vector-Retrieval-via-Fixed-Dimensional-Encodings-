WRITTEN QUESTION E-3463/10 by Filip Kaczmarek (PPE) to the Commission (14 May 2010) Subject: Directive on manning conditions for passenger and ferry services In 1998 the Commission submitted a proposal for a directive on manning conditions for regular passenger and ferry services operating between Member States (COM/98/251). This proposal raised concerns among Member States and, despite gaining the support of Parliament, was stalled for many years in the Council. The Commission decided to withdraw the proposal in 2004. Does the Commission intend to submit a new legislative proposal in this area?
