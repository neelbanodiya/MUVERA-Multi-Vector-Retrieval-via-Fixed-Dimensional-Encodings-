Question for written answer E-002460/2012 to the Council Rule 117 Auke Zijlstra (NI) (2 March 2012) Subject: Eastern Europeans increasingly turn to crime The Netherlands is seeing an increase in the number of Poles, Bulgarians, Romanians and other Central and Eastern Europeans who have turned to crime. The total number of burglaries and attempted burglaries in the Netherlands has also gone up by 4 % and now stands at 7 300. It has emerged that Central and Eastern European criminals sometimes operate in so-called flying squads, where they commit a series of burglaries in a short period of time and then leave the country before the police can detect patterns in their behaviour. Bulgarian criminals are also often involved in skimming. The Council of Police Force Commanders has launched an investigation into the criminal activities among Eastern Europeans in the Netherlands. 1. Is the Council familiar with the articles ‘Jobless Eastern Europeans increasingly turn to crime’ http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1040/Den-Haag/article/detail/3103241/2012/01/03/Werkloze-Oost-Europeaan-steeds-vaker-op-het-criminele-pad.dhtml and ‘An investigation into criminal activities among Eastern Europeans’ http://www.elsevier.nl/web/Artikel/326815/Onderzoek-naar-criminaliteit-OostEuropeanen.htm ? 2. What is the Council’s view of the increase in the number of criminals from Central and Eastern Europe in the Netherlands? 3. In its answer to Written Question E‑012317/2011, the Commission states that decisions regarding (internal) borders and border control are made by the Council. Does the Council agree with the PVV that the Netherlands should be able to close its borders in order to keep criminals out? If not, which measures does the Council think that the Netherlands can take?
