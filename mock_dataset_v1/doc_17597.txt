this envelope shall be increased by 100%. In addition that would take effect in the transition period following the 2004 enlargement. Another important element is linked to the experience after the introduction of the Euro in 12 of the 15 Member States as at the time of the introduction. The positive effects of this very important integration step were somewhat partly offset by the actual and perceived price increases. Even though the statistical effect was minimal, European citizens experienced most price increases in everyday goods and services. Lessons should be learnt from this experience. Already now preparatory actions need to be undertaken in the new Member States to observe and accompany the transition phase towards introduction of the Euro in the coming years. Therefore, the committee suggests the following amendments: 1) Budget line 17.02.01 shall be set at EUR 21 million instead of the proposed EUR 19 080 000 to allow some frontloading in view of the much enlarged financial envelope as of 2007. The increased funds should partly be earmarked for actions that would foster consumer confidence in the 10 Member States that joined the Union in 2004, including preparatory actions in relation to the introduction of the Euro in those Member States. Another part of the funds should be used to promote ethical standards for professional organisations that provide support to consumers. 4.
