Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) The Commission would like to underline that primary responsibility for the implementation of animal welfare legislation lies with the relevant Member States' authorities, which shall provide documented procedures to their official staff as well as appropriate training. In order to ensure a harmonised application of the requirements the Commission integrated training sessions on the implementation of the directive 2008/120/EC on the protection of pigs OJ L 47, 18.2.2009. in the Better Training for Safer Food Programme intended for official veterinarians. Regarding private veterinarians, the Commission adopted a communication on the EU strategy for the Protection and Welfare of animals 2012-2015 COM(2012) 6 final, http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/actionplan/docs/aw_strategy_19012012_en.pdf . The strategy foresees the development of EU guidelines on the protection of pigs in 2013. As part of this process, representatives of private veterinarians (FVE) will be consulted.
