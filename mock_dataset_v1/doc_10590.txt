changes to the scheme. The Commission has established informal dialogues with officials in Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand and Japan on the issue of potentially establishing links in the future between the EU emissions trading scheme and other schemes under Article 25 of the directive. In addition, the Commission is discussing with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein the applicability of the directive in the context of the EEA Agreement. In many countries, multiple design parameters for a national scheme are still being deliberated upon and so it is not possible, at this stage, for detailed discussions to take place in the context of a linking agreement under Article 25.
