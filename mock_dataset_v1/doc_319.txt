Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT) Procedure: Codecision, first reading Plenary vote: February, Strasbourg Press enquiries: Richard Freedman - tel.

MEPs called for ship-source discharges of polluting substances to be regarded as criminal offences if committed with intent, recklessly or by gross negligence. In the most serious cases prison sentences should not be ruled out, they said. Arguing that a European coastguard service could play a crucial role in combatting ship-source pollution, MEPs asked the Commission to compile a feasibility study on setting up such a service. And to ensure that discharges of polluting substances are detected in time, MEPs would like the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) to be strengthened. They say EMSA should assist the Member States in tracing illegal discharges by providing satellite monitoring and surveillance. The Transport Committee made these demands in the context of a recommendation at second reading on ship-source pollution and the introduction of sanctions. The recommendation, drafted by Corien WORTMANN-KOOL (EPP-ED, NL), was approved by 26 votes to 4, with 20 abstentions. 19.01.2005 Committee on Transport and Tourism In the chair: Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT) Procedure: Codecision, second reading Plenary vote: February 2005 Press enquiries: Ton Huyssoon - tel.
