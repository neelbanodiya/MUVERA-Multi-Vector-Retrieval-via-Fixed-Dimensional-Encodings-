Question for written answer E-001431/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (23 February 2011) Subject: Suspension of funding for doctoral theses in Greece As a result of a decision of the Greek Ministry of Education, the State Scholarship Foundation (IKY) has decided to suspend funding for doctoral programmes and post-doctoral research in Greece for the current academic year. The downgrading of the importance of excellence and innovation in Greece is a blow to the country's development prospects, particularly during the current critical period. I ask the Commission: 1. What is its reaction to this decision by the Greek Government at a time when the Greek economy is badly in need of increased competitiveness underpinned by research and innovation? 2. Are there data regarding the number of government grants given for doctoral and post-doctoral studies in each country in relation to the number of doctoral candidates? What is Greece's position?
