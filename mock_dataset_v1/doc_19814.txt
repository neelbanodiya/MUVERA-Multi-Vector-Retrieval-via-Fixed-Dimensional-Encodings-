Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (23 November 2006) The Commission is not informed about individual controls on the quality of public works carried out by ESPEL. The results of such controls have to be taken into account by the Greek authorities, in the context of their controls under Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 438/2001 Commission Regulation (EC) No 438/2001 of 2 March 2001 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 as regards the management and control systems for assistance granted under the Structural Funds, OJ L 63, 3.3.2001. and each time a request for payment is submitted to the Commission. As illustrated below, the amounts in expenditure which have been suspended following an ESPEL control are relatively limited, when compared to the overall amounts declared for payment under the third Community support framework. On this basis, one may conclude that so far the number of public works with serious qualitative problems is limited as well. Based on the latest requests submitted to the Commission by the relevant Greek authorities in June 2006, the paying authority has suspended payment claims for the amount of EUR 140 million for 70 projects co‑financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and for the amount of EUR 4.8 million for 15 projects co‑financed by the European Agricultural and Guidance Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). According to the information provided by the Greek authorities, the call for tenders relating to the new ESPEL contract was published on 18 October 2006. The deadline for submission of tenders is 11 December 2006 and the contract is expected to be signed for the first quarter of 2007. With regard to the 2004 tranche of the third Community support framework (CSF) for Greece, the automatic decommitment procedure based on the rule of n+2 will not begin until January 2007, taking account of payment claims which the Greek authorities may submit until 31 December 2006. It is therefore not possible at present to predict what amounts may risk being decommitted.
