WRITTEN QUESTION E-3901/05 by Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (25 October 2005) Subject: EU strategy for Africa The Commission has recently adopted a new action strategy for Africa, the ‘Africa Plan’, which involves an extra EUR 10000 million being assigned to the continent. Could the Commission explain where these funds are going to come from, since they do not appear in the proposal for a new financial perspective? Could the Commission further explain whether this increase will involve cutting development aid to other less-favoured regions?
