EC Treaty, the responsibility for the organisation and content of education belongs to Member States. It is therefore up to Member States to put measures in place to improve the educational prospects of young people with disabilities. The mandate of the Commission in the field of education is to promote cooperation among Member States with a view to the improvement of the overall quality of the systems. To do so, the Commission has supported since 1996 an Agency for Development in Special Needs Education (www.european-agency.org) which has the main task of analysing the situation of disabled people in education and people with special educational needs throughout Europe. The results of such analysis, together with other data, are published in the Commission's annual indicators and benchmarks reports on progress towards the Lisbon objectives in education and training. In particular, the 2007 edition of this Progress Report, which will be issued in the autumn of 2007, will contain a chapter focussing on equity with extensive information on the situation of pupils with disabilities across Europe. In addition, there is scope for Cohesion Policy to support measures to improve accessibility for disabled people, including to education infrastructures and to education and training systems, through the operational programmes drawn up by Member States and regions in partnership with the Commission. Moreover, according to Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, accessibility for disabled persons shall be one of the criteria to be observed in defining operations co-financed by the Funds and to be taken into account during the various stages of implementation.
