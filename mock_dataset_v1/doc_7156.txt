WRITTEN QUESTION E-2450/10 by Alan Kelly (S&D) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: Self-regulation in the phone industry/universal phone charger Considerable time has passed since DG Industry announced the development of a standardised phone charger. Can the Commission provide an update on progress on this issue? Can the Commission indicate when it expects this standardisation to take effect? Will it be on track for this year? Is the Commission confident that the telecommunications sector's self-regulation and the Memorandum of Agreement are enough to secure industry compliance?
