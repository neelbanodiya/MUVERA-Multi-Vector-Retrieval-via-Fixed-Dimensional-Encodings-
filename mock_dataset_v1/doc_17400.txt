rather than the Constitutional Treaty. • Local and regional assemblies and executive bodies should become actively involved at an institutional level, and should participate fully in the debate on the future of the EU, while shouldering their responsibilities vis-à-vis the public. • Possible subjects for the debate: the role and importance of fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter included in the Constitutional Treaty, the European social model, solidarity, subsidiarity and proportionality, the single market, competitiveness, growth and employment, the environment, sustainable development, energy policy, public services and how to fund them, economic aspects of economic and monetary union, the challenges of globalisation for SMEs, rights and freedoms and the sense of belonging linked to European citizenship, the area of security, freedom and justice, enlargement versus closer integration, policies on education, research and innovation. Moreover, the topics covered should be adapted to particular circumstances identified at local and regional levels. • The CoR is keen to play a proactive role, in partnership with the European Parliament; MEPs and local and regional elected representatives will have to join forces to contribute to the political and democratic debate during the period of reflection. • To enable effective and appropriate implementation of the proposed measures, the CoR would like to obtain additional funding; a new budget heading could even be introduced for this purpose from 2006 onwards. Measures envisaged for 2006-2009 • European Forums could be set up simultaneously in all the Member States to facilitate open exchange and discussion on Europe, its values, objectives and frontiers: – 1st phase (October 2005 – March 2006): establishment of regional committees comprising "ambassadors" from local and regional authorities and representing the network of CoR members, political parties, members of regional and national parliaments, the local and regional media, civil society as well as social and educational players; these would serve to raise public awareness, particularly among young people, and to raise the profile of European policies. – 2nd phase (from January 2006 – June 2009): holding public meetings in European cities and regions, with the participation of CoR members and MEPs, to discuss problems which have been identified: • to identify target groups: local and regional administration, journalists, teachers, young people, etc.; • in cooperation with the European Parliament and with the assistance of the media, to identify problems which ordinary Europeans feel to be particularly relevant, by listening to the problems and fears expressed
