WRITTEN QUESTION E-0330/06 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 February 2006) Subject: European goodwill ambassadors During the ‘period of reflection’ which the EU is undergoing as part of the process of ratifying the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Commission has issued a Communication entitled ‘The Commission's contribution to the period of reflection and beyond: Plan-D for democracy, dialogue and debate’ (COM(2005)494 final, Brussels 13 October 2005), in which it proposes to stimulate a wider public debate. As part of this initiative ‘The Commission will seek to work with Member States to organise a series of regionally based events with “European goodwill ambassadors”, building on previous models like used by the United Nations and the experience of membership referenda in new Member States, and invite well known personalities or national and local celebrities from the cultural, business, sport or any other area of interest to target audiences.’ In the light of the above, will the Commission say: 1. what steps its responsible departments have taken thus far to promote these events? Does it intend to launch a procedure for drawing up a list of ‘European goodwill ambassadors’? 2. By what specific means does it intend to assist the national authorities in their efforts to mobilise the largest number of personalities? 3. What particular qualities will be required of the ambassadors to be appointed?
