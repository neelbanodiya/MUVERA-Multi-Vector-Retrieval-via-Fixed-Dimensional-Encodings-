legal instrument; 14. Urges the Council, after receiving Parliament's opinion, to rapidly adopt the proposal for a framework decision on procedural guarantees under criminal law in the European Union which the Commission has just presented and which will ensure protection of individual rights following the entry into force of the European Arrest Warrant; 15. Stresses that one of the EU's priorities in the fight against terrorism is to reinforce cooperation between police services, including a more structured role for the Task Force of EU Police Chiefs, so as to ensure the interoperability of national security plans and to share intelligence data; therefore calls on the Member States and the acceding States to do so; 16. Welcomes the European Council's call for the adoption before 1 May 2004 of the Council Directive on compensation to victims of serious crimes and terrorism, so as to ensure adequate redress for the damage and sufferings to which they are subjected, and states its willingness to increase significantly the financial allocation for the relevant pilot project, upgrading its status to that of a major EU action which should focus on psychological and material assistance to the victims; 17. Believes that measures taken to defend the values of democracy and freedom against terrorist acts cannot be allowed to undermine the fundamental aspects of those values; believes, in particular, that efforts should be increased to reinforce the protection of civil liberties, fundamental rights and personal data; 18. Stresses that, to tackle the terrorist threat, the European Union does not need exceptional legal instruments or institutions, but that the Council has to adopt the existing proposals and the Member States have to fully implement the legislative instruments relevant to the fight against terrorism; in this regard, calls on the Commission to publish a regular "league table" on implementation by the Member States of anti-terrorism legislation; 19. Deplores the intolerable lack of progress and the consistent failure of the Member States to put joint pressure on the United States to charge or release detainees held at Guantánamo Bay; 20. Regrets that the role of Europol and Eurojust has so far been underestimated and asks that they be given an enhanced role in strategic intelligence gathering and coordination of investigations of trans-border criminal activities, in cooperation with national police and judicial authorities; also deplores the fact that the anti-terrorist unit created within Europol after 11 September 2001 has been disbanded
