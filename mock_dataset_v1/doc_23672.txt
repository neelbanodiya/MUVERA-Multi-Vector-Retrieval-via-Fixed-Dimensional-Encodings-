WRITTEN QUESTION E-6639/09 by Oriol Junqueras Vies (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (12 January 2010) Subject: The Spanish film industry — absence of definitions and failure to comply with Community competition law The Spanish Government has submitted a draft royal decree intended to bring Spain's law on the cinema into line with the requirements of the Commission, but turning its back on the spirit of cultural diversity and the legal obligation to defend it with a system of aids that are compatible with the Community competition rules as laid down in the Commission communication to the Council, the European Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on certain legal aspects relating to cinematographic and other audiovisual works (COM(2001)0534 OJ C 43, 16.2.2002, p. 6. ). Thus, the regime governing such aids, set out in the draft royal decree modifying Royal Decree 2062/2008 of 12 December 2008 implementing Law 55/2007 of 28 December 2007 (law on the cinema), is in contradiction with paragraph 2(3)(b) of that communication. In principle, the aid granted should not exceed 50 % of the production budget, with a view to stimulating normal commercial initiatives inherent in a market economy and avoiding a bidding contest between Member States. This limit does not apply to ‘difficult’ or ‘low-budget’ films. The Commission believes that, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, it is up to each Member State to define what is meant by ‘difficult’ and ‘low-budget’ films, on the basis of national parameters. Is the Commission aware that the text of the Spanish draft royal decree does not, in the context of such awards, include a definition of ‘difficult’ and ‘low-budget’ films as required by the Community legislation?
