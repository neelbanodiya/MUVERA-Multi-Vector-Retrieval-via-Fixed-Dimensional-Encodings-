ORAL QUESTION H-0346/09 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2009 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Council Subject: Electronic surveillance in the EU A total of 1 041 821 persons entering or leaving Greece had their personal data recorded in a large-scale exercise carried out in 24 EU Member States during one week from 31 August to 6 September 2009. The total number of those who had their data recorded and were registered electronically at EU level was 12 907 581. This exercise took place in accordance with document No. 10410/09 of the EU Strategic Committee for Immigration, and its object was to gather the personal data of all those entering or departing through EU borders. In implementing the EU institutional framework which Nea Dimokratia and PASOK governments had agreed to, Greece swiftly implemented the data-gathering measures, logging up the fifth largest number of people recorded. How does the Council view exercises of this kind which form part of designs to build a 'Fortress Europe' and create a gigantic system of electronic border controls and surveillance of all travellers, thereby drastically curtailing fundamental democratic rights and freedoms?
