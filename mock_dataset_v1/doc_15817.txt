WRITTEN QUESTION E-3756/09 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) and Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (27 July 2009) Subject: Western Sahara resources In January 2009, the Government of the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) declared a 200‑nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the context of its jurisdiction over its offshore fisheries and mineral and petroleum seabed resources, as provided for under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Under the terms of the fisheries partnership agreement with Morocco, EU‑flagged vessels have been pursued fishing activities in the waters included in this declaration of jurisdiction (see answer to Question E‑4295/08 by Commissioner Borg). Since Morocco has never declared jurisdiction over these waters, the government of the SADR appears to be the only body that has ever declared such jurisdiction. Was the Commission aware that such a declaration was made? What is the Commission's view of the legal status of the declaration? What effect does it have on the EU's bilateral fisheries agreement with Morocco? Does the Commission agree that the terms of the bilateral agreement should be clarified to specifically exclude the waters south of 28º 44´ North latitude, so as to avoid any possible prejudice to the international status of Western Sahara? If the Commission does not consider that the declaration has any effect on the conditions of access for EU vessels to the waters off Western Sahara, could it please explain its reasoning in detail?
