Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (28 July 2005) The Commission has, together with the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA), launched a coordinated consultation process with the Member States and the European influenza vaccine manufacturers with a view to examining options for optimising supply of suitable vaccines that can be offered to Community citizens in the event of a pandemic. A strategy has been developed and Health Ministers were urged at their Council meeting of 3 June 2005 to endorse efforts on preparedness which include the preparation and coordination of national plans, vaccination coverage and schemes and partnerships with the industry for advance purchase of vaccines that might be cushioned by Commission proposals to reimburse pandemic influenza vaccines and antivirals through the Solidarity Fund. Member States have backed an initiative of public vaccine institutes which have submitted a proposal to the Commission for co-funding under the public health programme, on how to establish effective collaboration on faster provision of better vaccines. Given present estimated levels of flexibility in syringe production capacities, as far as is known to the Commission, and considering that in the event of a pandemic it will at least take several months before effective pandemic vaccines become available for delivery, anticipated shortages in supply of suitable syringes ought, however, to be satisfactorily addressed within the lead time, i.e. the minimum interval between isolation of the pandemic strain and procurement of suitable vaccines. As these needs may also be dealt with before a pandemic strikes, arrangements for securing adequate supplies are not considered a key issue in pandemic preparedness planning.
