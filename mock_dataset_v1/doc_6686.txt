9999/C Q999 E/033 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1448/04 by Jan Mulder (ELDR) to the Commission (29 April 2004) Subject: Distortion of competition by CO2 allocation plans Pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC OJ L 275, 25.10.2003, p. 32 . , each Member State was required to publish and notify to the Commission by 31 March 2004 a national allocation plan for carbon dioxide emission allowances. 1. How many Member States have complied with these requirements? 2. On the basis of the allocation plans notified, does the Commission consider competition between Member States and between sectors of the economy to have been distorted? 3. In assessing the allocations, is the Commission taking account of the fact that in the past certain sectors have already achieved considerable savings, while others have not? 4. Does it accord with the EU directive if sectors which have not yet been able to participate in trading in carbon dioxide emission allowances are nonetheless assigned a carbon dioxide ceiling by the national authorities and if they suffer financial damage for exceeding it? 5. In the Netherlands' allocation plan, the targets set for industry (including energy) and transport are 17% and 29% respectively higher than the 1990 emission level, while that for agriculture is 29% below the 1990 level. Does this plan accord with the directive, and will it not damage competition between sectors?
