is true that a mixture with similar composition can be obtained by blending glucose, fructose, sucrose and water together. In the latter case and regardless of whether this way of production would be cost efficient or economically competitive when compared to sucrose hydrolysis, the resulting mixture would be considered as a ‘mixture’ of glucose, fructose, sucrose and water and not as a multi-constituent substance under REACH. This situation has indeed arisen as a result of continuing to use definitions of substance and mixture in REACH and the chemicals legislation of the past decades. However, should REACH have adopted a different approach, which may seem more logical for this specific case, then the Commission believes that the impact would have been undesirable and disproportionate for many other substances and mixtures.
