ORAL QUESTION H-0582/03 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Bill Newton Dunn to the Council Subject: Council press conferences The Council is unwilling, as ever, to deal with the problem it has created of taxpayers having to pay vast amounts of money to keep the European Parliament travelling between Brussels and Strasbourg. Therefore, to assist the media in reporting the proceedings of the Parliament while it is in Strasbourg, and thus informing the public better about the Union, will the Council kindly decide not to hold any press conferences of its own in Brussels while the Parliament is in Strasbourg - a practice which the Council used to operate? If not, why not?
