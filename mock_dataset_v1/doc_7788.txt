WRITTEN QUESTION E-4047/05 by Mathieu Grosch (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 November 2005) Subject: ‘Top-of-the-range simulators’ for the (periodic) training of the drivers of certain road vehicles Directive 2003/59/EC OJ L 226, 10.9.2003, p. 4 . on the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers introduced, but did not define, the term ‘top-of-the-range simulator’. Given that the directive must be transposed by 10 September 2006 and that the investment required to purchase such simulators is considerable, training centres are becoming increasingly worried about what is meant by ‘top of the range’. What criteria are used to define a ‘top-of-the-range simulator’? Would the Commission be prepared to state whether a given simulator available on the market can be described as ‘top of the range’, or, alternatively, can the Commission give examples of existing ‘top-of-the-range simulators’? Is it certain that a definition of ‘top-of-the-range simulator’ will be adopted in good time by the committee set up under the terms of Directive 2003/59/EC so that the directive can be transposed into national law? Will the Commission take steps to ensure that any such definition is precise enough to guarantee high-quality training and to make for fair competition between training centres, at the same time allowing sufficient leeway so that an efficient market in simulators can develop?
