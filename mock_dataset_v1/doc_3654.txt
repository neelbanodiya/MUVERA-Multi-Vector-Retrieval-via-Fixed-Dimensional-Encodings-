ORAL QUESTION H-0779/02 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Konstantinos Alyssandrakis to the Commission Subject: Deepening of regional disparities revealed by Eurostat data According to the latest Eurostat data, Greece remains the poorest of the 15 Member States of the European Union. The indicators for unemployment, poverty and inflation are much higher than the EU average. The figures produced by Eurostat show that the actual situation is utterly at odds with public announcements concerning economic convergence within the EU and confirm estimations that social and regional disparities are increasing. Does the Commission consider that limiting funding for the agricultural policy, the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and channelling those resources to more beneficiaries, as will happen following enlargement, will result in an even greater deepening of regional and social contrasts, rising unemployment and a deterioration in the standard of living of workers?
