Considers that the realisation of the energy diversification projects should be one of the priorities of the strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), and calls for enhanced support for improvement of the investment climate and the regulatory framework, based on the principles of the ECT, in the energy sectors of the producer and transit countries; 22. Calls for recognition of the diversity of situations in which various Member States find themselves when it comes to energy mix, import dependency and infrastructure, and supports all efforts aimed at overcoming the existing dependencies of Member States on dominant suppliers, on infrastructure limitations, on carbon-intensive sources of energy and on energy imports from countries that systematically violate the letter and spirit of the UN Charter; 23.

In the context of incentives for biofuel or biomass use in the EU, regards it as imperative for the EU to ascertain that such use does not threaten global food security or lead to increased pressure on natural forests, an expansion in monocultures or exotic species plantations, or the exacerbation of climate change through tropical deforestation; B.
