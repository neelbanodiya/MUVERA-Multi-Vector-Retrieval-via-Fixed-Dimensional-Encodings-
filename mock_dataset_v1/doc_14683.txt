2004/C 51 E/008 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2801/02 by Miquel Mayol i Raynal (Verts/ALE) to the Council (7 October 2002) Subject: Imprisonment of Leyla Zana and Turkey's accession to the EU According to Amnesty International, Mrs Leyla Zana is currently in a Turkish prison for having dared to speak in Kurdish at her inauguration as a member of the Turkish parliament. Has the Council been informed of this situation? Should these reports prove accurate, does it believe that a State practising repression of this kind can accede to the European Union?
