to improve equal opportunities in the Union. The Commission’s Report contains chapters on the strategic framework programme for improving equal opportunities 2001-2005, the legislative evolution on equal opportunities, enlargement, external relations including development policy and the perspective for 2002. The committee does however regret the absence of a competent authority on gender mainstreaming within the Council of Ministers, as well the lack of support for the participation of women to vacancies within the Commission. The committee welcomes the fact that equal pay remains a priority, but calls on the Commission to propose a new directive which would enforce the 1975 directive, as, despite a resolution of the European Parliament, the gap between men’s and women’s pay remains wide.

The draft resolution also calls for the powers of the European Ombudsman to be extended in order to improve the protection of women’s rights, with the recommendation of a deputy Ombudsman being nominated with the sole responsibility for equal opportunities.

The draft resolution points out that the European Union set itself the objective at the Barcelona summit of approaching a figure of 3% of GDP for investment in research by 2010. At present, however, that figure is only 1.92%, compared to 2.64% in the United States and 3.04% in Japan. Mr Piétrasanta wants the target for participation by women in the sixth framework research and development programme, together with the bursaries awarded to them, to be set at 50%. Mr Piétrasanta also outlines that the procedures for participating in the fifth framework research and development programme are cumbersome and complicated and therefore calls on the Commission to do
