resources that are beyond the means of local governments and industry; recognizes, on the other hand, that smaller-scale national R&D policies may often be in a better position to react adequately to changing opportunities and market developments; therefore, urges the Commission and the Member States to reinforce and coordinate their R&D efforts in this field; to this end, recommends the creation, in each Member State and on the basis of each country’s characteristics, of a minimum critical mass of infrastructure and scientists with specific expertise in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, leading ultimately to the creation of specialised centres of excellence in some countries which would be coordinated at EU level; 7. Draws particular attention to nanomedicine as a promising interdisciplinary domain with breakthrough technologies such as molecular imaging and diagnostics, which can offer impressive benefits for the early diagnosis and smart and cost-effective treatment of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular problems, diabetes, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's; urges the Commission and national and regional authorities to boost their R&D investments in this domain and to coordinate their efforts by means of the Nanomedicine European Technology Platform proposed in the Seventh Research Framework Programme (FP7), and by means of other instruments, including the proposed FP7 Regions of Knowledge, so as to achieve critical mass in this field; 8. Stresses the major role to be played by nanosciences and nanotechnologies in developing molecular biology; 9. Is convinced that multidisciplinary nanosciences and nanotechnologies should be geared to the development of hydrogen energy, including the development of new and effective means of storing hydrogen and efficient fuel cells, as well as information-carrying technologies with much greater capacity than at present; 10. Stresses the considerable progress made in Europe in the field of nanotechnologies, based on a 'top-down' approach, particularly in areas such as abrasion - and corrosion - proof coatings and layers, and also the production of catalysers and photodiodes, including the so-called blue laser, as well as in the field of nanomedicine, nanocosmetics and nanodiagnosis of diseases; 11. Believes that the level of basic European research can make it possible to find technological tools that will enable a 'bottom-up' approach to be adopted, particularly in nanoelectronics; 12. Believes that actions to accelerate technology development must be complemented by policy measures to ensure the market penetration of existing technologies; notes that standards can provide a level playing field for markets and international trade and are prerequisites for
