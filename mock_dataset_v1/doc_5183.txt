EMPL European Platform against poverty and social exclusion On 13 July 2011, EMPL Members considered the 396 amendments tabled to the draft report of Frederic Daerden (S&D - BE) based on the Commission Communication on the same subject which is one of seven Flagship initiatives of the Europe 2020 strategy. The rapporteur underlined that the amendments tabled generally reinforce the draft report views aiming to promote an adequate policy to combat poverty and social exclusion. Most of them refer extensively to a range of measures to be promoted in many sectors linked with poverty and social exclusion. With few exceptions, regarding namely European legislative initiatives as a response to poverty and exclusion, the amendments are complementary to the draft report and aim to enrich the measures to be taken in order to tackle the multidimensional phenomenon of poverty and exclusion in an efficient manner. These, as well as three opinions expected from BUDG, CULT and FEMM Committees, will be considered in compromise amendments which will be proposed by the rapporteur. Consideration of compromise amendments and the adoption in EMPL is foreseen to take place during the meeting of 8 September 2011.
