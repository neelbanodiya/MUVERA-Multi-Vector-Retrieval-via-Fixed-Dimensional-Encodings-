Rotary evaporator 5.4. Preparation of extract and separation of non-ionic active agents 5.4.1. Preparation of extract The quantity of surfactant necessary for the degradation test is about 25 g BiAS. In preparing extracts for the degradation tests, the quantity of product to be used should be limited to a maximum of 2 000 g. Therefore it may be necessary to carry out the operation two or more times in order to obtain sufficient quantity for the degradation tests. Experience has shown that there are advantages in using a number of small extractions rather than one large extraction. 5.4.2. Isolation of alcohol-soluble constituents Add 250 g of the synthetic detergent to be analysed to 1 250 ml ethanol and heat the mixture to boiling point and reflux for one hour with stirring. Pass the hot alcoholic solution through a coarse-pored suction filter heated to 50 °C and filter rapidly. Wash the flask and suction filter with approximately 200 ml hot ethanol. Collect the filtrate and filter washings in a filter flask. In the case of pastes or liquid products to be analysed, make sure that not more than 25 g anionic surfactants and 35 g soap are contained in the sample. Evaporate this weighed sample to dryness. Dissolve the residue in 500 ml ethanol and proceed as described above. In the case of powders of low apparent density (< 300 g/l) it is recommended to increase the ethanol ratio in the relation 20:1. Evaporate the ethanolic filtrate to complete dryness, preferably by means of rotary evaporator. Repeat the operation if a greater quantity of extract is required. Dissolve the residue in 5 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture. 5.4.3. Preparation of ion-exchange columns CATION-EXCHANGE COLUMN Place 600 ml cation-exchange resin (5.3.5) in a 3 000 ml beaker and cover by adding 2 000 ml hydrochloric acid
