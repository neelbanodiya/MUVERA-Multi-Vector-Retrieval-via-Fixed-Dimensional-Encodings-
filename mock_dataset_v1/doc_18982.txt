57,6 million from SAPARD and between EUR 93 and EUR 127 million from ISPA; supports the decision to provide additional Phare funding of EUR 200 million over the period 2000 - 2006 to facilitate the decommissioning of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant; 2. Underlines once more the importance of timely and effective implementation of the SAPARD programme and of projects funded under Phare and ISPA; 3. Has welcomed in principle the definition of a new framework in spring 2004 to finance the accession of Bulgaria; has noted with interest the Commission's approach to limit this financial package to a period of three years from Bulgaria's accession (2007 - 2009) in order to be able to adapt it to future policy reforms following fundamental changes in the coming financial perspectives; 4. Points out once again that financial assistance will depend on an agreement on a new financial perspective post2006 and an adjustment of the financial perspectives; 5. Considers it inconsistent with this approach if, despite these known limitations, the Commission still makes statements on the phasing-in of direct payments in agriculture for Bulgaria up to the year 2016; 6. Stresses that the current financial perspective will already expire in 2006 so that fundamental changes in the Union's financial framework might already come into effect at the beginning of 2007.
