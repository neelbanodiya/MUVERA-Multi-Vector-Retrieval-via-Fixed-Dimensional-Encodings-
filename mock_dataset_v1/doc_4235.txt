WRITTEN QUESTION E-0392/10 by Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) to the Council (8 February 2010) Subject: Solitary confinement of seven Sahrawi human rights defenders facing trial in a military court On 8 October 2009 the Moroccan police arrested seven Sahrawi human rights defenders (Ali Salem Tamek, Brahim Dahin, Enguiya Lachgar, Hamadi Nasiri, Saleh Lubeihi, Rachid Esgair, and Yahdih Tarruzi) on their return from a tour of Sahrawi refugee camps. According to the Casablanca Public Prosecutor’s Office, they will be tried by a military court for ‘acting against the higher interests of the Nation’ and ‘collaborating with the enemy’, offences for which they could be sentenced to death. After being held prisoner for more than three months, they have been reduced to an even sorrier plight: according to the Sahrawi Ministry for the Occupied Territories and Sahrawi Communities Abroad, they have been moved to isolated solitary confinement cells with no light or ventilation. In its answer to Question E‑5374/09 the Commission stated that it knew that these Sahrawi human rights defenders were being held and was following their case ‘very closely’ through its delegation in Rabat. The EU also attaches great importance to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Morocco, a point made by the Commission in its answer to Question E‑3578/07. In view of the above facts, is the Council aware that the situation has worsened for the seven Sahrawi human rights defenders? Will it take any steps to secure their release? Bearing in mind that relations between the EU and Morocco are expanding and that Article 2 of the EU‑Morocco Association Agreement contains a human rights clause, does not the Council consider that the EU‑Morocco Advanced Status should be suspended until such time as Morocco ends the political persecution of the Sahrawis and releases those who have been arbitrarily arrested because they have sought to exercise their civil and political rights?
