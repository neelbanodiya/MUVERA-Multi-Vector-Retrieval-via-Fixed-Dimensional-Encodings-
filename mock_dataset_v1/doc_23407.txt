WRITTEN QUESTION E-4678/09 by Charles Tannock (ECR) to the Commission (6 October 2009) Subject: Lending restrictions and reform of the mortgage-backed securities market As the Commission is aware, the current world financial crisis was sparked by the failure of a British building society, Northern Rock, which had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities and had relied on the wholesale money market for a large part of its short-term financing, despite the obvious dangers of doing so on the basis of a model which assumed ever-rising house prices. The UK Financial Services Authority, the regulatory agency set up by the British Government to oversee the banks' activities after it had taken these powers away from the Bank of England, simply failed to adequately supervise this bank, missing appointments and failing to inspect the books for over three years before Northern Rock went bust. This, of course, was not an isolated failure, and, as the full extent of the crisis emerged, legislators on both sides of the Atlantic who had been persuaded of the benefits of ‘light-touch’ regulation were outraged to discover that greed, sloppy accounting practices, and an abject failure of the regulatory agencies to do their job had imperilled the entire world banking system. A key component of the mortgage crisis was the deregulation of the securities market that took place in the US in 1997‑98, allowing the bundling of mortgage-based assets with widely differing provenance and levels of risk, assets that were then subsequently given wholly unwarranted credit ratings by the world's leading risk-rating agencies. In many cases, lenders had been encouraged to take out mortgages which they could not possibly afford, and were allowed to self-certify their income levels. It was these kinds of risky subprime packages that Northern Rock had invested in. If the US Government fails to prudentially re-regulate its mortgage-backed securities market, does the Commission believe that financial institutions operating within the EU should be prohibited from purchasing such assets or will such matters remain in the competence of Member State regulators?
