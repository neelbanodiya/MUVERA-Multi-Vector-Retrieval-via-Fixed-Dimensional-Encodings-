Reply (25 January 2012) The Honourable Member refers to a memorandum of understanding concluded between Turkey and the European Commission to which the Council is not a party. The Council cannot therefore comment on this issue. Concerning the additional questions put by the Honourable Member, the Council would refer her to the conclusions on enlargement and the stabilisation and association process adopted by the Council on 5 December 2011 18089/11. , in particular paragraph 23 of those conclusions, and to the subsequent conclusions reached by the Heads of State and Government at the last European Council meeting on 9 December 2011 EUCO 139/11. : ‘Recalling the Council conclusions of 5 December on enlargement, with regard to Turkish statements and threats, the European Council expresses serious concern and calls for full respect of the role of the Presidency of the Council, which is a fundamental institutional feature of the EU provided for in the Treaty.’
