WRITTEN QUESTION E-2265/05 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (27 June 2005) Subject: Planned demolition of houses in Silwan neighbourhood Is the Commission aware that the Israeli Government plans to demolish 88 houses in the East Jerusalem suburb of Silwan? If this were to go ahead it would contravene the Road Map and be highly detrimental to peace efforts in the area. The Road Map denotes ‘the Government of Israel ends actions, undermining trust, including attacks in civilian areas and confiscation/demolition of Palestinians’ homes/property’. Does the Commission plan to apply pressure to the Israeli Government to abandon the plan to raze the houses in the Silwan area?
