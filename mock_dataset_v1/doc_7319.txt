9999/C Q999 E/004 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0976/04 by Avril Doyle (PPE-DE) to the Commission (19 March 2004) Subject: Equality in sentencing Parts 1, 2 and 3 of Rule 38 of Ireland´s 1947 Prison Rules, which are still in force, state that, upon good conduct and industry, female prisoners are entitled to one third remission of sentence, whereas male prisoners receive one quarter remission. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees equality for EU citizens. Article 20 deals with equality before the law. Article 21 relates to non-discrimination, and Article 23 concerns equal treatment for men and women. Given that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is legally binding and that Ireland is a signatory thereto, can the Commission indicate whether, under European Law, this difference in sentencing practice for men and women is lawful? What measures, if any, are being taken to ensure the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights as regards equality in the prison system?
