Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (31 January 2012) The European Commission has started three infringement procedures on 17 January 2012 against Hungary over new legislation that came into force at the beginning of the year under Hungary's new constitution. For the Commission, the Hungarian legislation conflicts with EC law by putting into question the independence of the country's central bank and data protection authorities and by measures affecting its judiciary. The Hungarian authorities were given one month to respond to the Commission's concerns. Only changes to the legislation in question, or their suspension, will be able to accommodate the Commission's legal concerns.
