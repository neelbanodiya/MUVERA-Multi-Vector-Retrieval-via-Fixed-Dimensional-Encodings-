WRITTEN QUESTION E-2866/10 by Marian-Jean Marinescu (PPE) to the Commission (29 April 2010) Subject: Routine passport checks for passengers flying with TAROM Recently passengers travelling with the airline TAROM have had their passports checked routinely on arrival. These checks give cause for concern because passengers would like an explanation and are treated as though they are under investigation. The Romanian authorities have already tried to obtain answers but no explanation has yet been given, either by the airport authorities or the European Agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex). What is the Commission's opinion regarding the legality of these checks? What action does the Commission intend to take to ensure that these routine checks are justified? What steps might be taken by the European Union with a view to avoiding any improper treatment of EU citizens?
