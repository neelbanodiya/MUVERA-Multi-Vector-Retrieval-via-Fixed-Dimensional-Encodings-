the publication of the review, important developments have taken place, e.g. the United Kingdom (UK) has recently launched the data.gov.uk portal providing already a single access point to over 2 500 central government datasets which have been made available for commercial and non-commercial re-use under a set of simple and enabling conditions. The Commission will carry out a further review by 2012 when more evidence on the impact, effects and application of the directive should be available. It will consider legislative amendments at that stage, taking into consideration the progress made in the meantime in the MS. Regarding the proposal by some stakeholders to create a ‘PSI Market Observatory’ — presented as a self-standing entity — the Commission has analysed the proposal against the commitments it has undertaken to foster PSI re-use. In fact, there are a number of initiatives, which serve the purpose of monitoring developments and the sector, promoting PSI re-use and coordinating various actions. Among them are the PSI Platform http://www.epsiplatform.eu/, it is a ‘one-stop-shop’ Web portal aiming to stimulate action, report developments and monitor progress towards a stronger and more transparent environment for the growth of national and European PSI re-use markets. , the PSI Group set up by the Commission in 2002 http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/facilitating_reuse/psigroup/index_en.htm, it is an expert group constituted to exchange good practices and initiatives supporting public sector information re-use, discuss and recommend solutions to challenges such as charging, exclusive agreements, development indicators for measuring public sector information and technology. The PSI Group consists of representatives of 27 Member States, Private sector organisations. PSI experts are regularly invited to the meeting on an ad-hoc basis. , the recently launched study on Exclusive Agreements http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/psi/facilitating_reuse/exlusive_agreements/index_en.htm and the forthcoming network on Legal Aspects of PSI (LAPSI). In the context of these existing initiatives and activities, the Commission estimates that it is not appropriate to create the proposed Observatory.
