WRITTEN QUESTION P-5650/07 by Marie Panayotopoulos-Cassiotou (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 November 2007) Subject: Undeclared work What percentage of work is undeclared, according to the Commission's calculations and what is its short and long-term impact on competitiveness per EU Member State? What is the correlation between undeclared or partly declared work and flexible forms of employment? Apart from imposing sanctions on employers who employ nationals of third countries who are illegally resident, what other measures does the Commission propose in order to stamp out the use of such workers in performing undeclared work in violation of existing conventions on decent working conditions? Does the Commission intend to propose European and international cooperation measures in the field of supervisory systems (work inspections, etc.) and the enactment of legislation, as demanded by the European Parliament resolution on promoting decent work for all (resolution of 23 March 2007, P6_TA(2007)0206 , A6-0068/2007 )?
