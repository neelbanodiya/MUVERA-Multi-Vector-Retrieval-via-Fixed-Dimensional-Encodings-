WRITTEN QUESTION E-0424/10 by João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (12 February 2010) Subject: Community instruments to support disaster prevention In its communication of 23 February 2009 entitled ‘A Community approach on the prevention of natural and man made disasters’ (COM(2009)0082), the Commission undertook to establish, in 2009, an inventory of existing Community instruments capable of supporting disaster prevention activities, assessing the degree of use of such instruments and identifying any gaps in their coverage. It also undertook to develop a catalogue of prevention measures that could be considered by the Member States for EU funding (for example, including measures to integrate preventive action in reforestation/afforestation projects). Can the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Has this inventory now been made? When does the Commission expect it to be completed? 2. Does the Commission already have the conclusions (or preliminary conclusions) of the work carried out? 3. Has the abovementioned catalogue of measures been developed? When does the Commission expect it to be completed? 4. Can the Commission describe some of these measures?
