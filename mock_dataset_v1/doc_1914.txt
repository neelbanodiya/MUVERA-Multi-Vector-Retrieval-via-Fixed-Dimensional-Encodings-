9999/C Q999 E/223 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3900/03 by Giacomo Santini (PPE-DE) to the Commission (08 December 2003) Subject: Trieste-Divaca rail link Under Commission proposal COM(2003) 564 of 1 October 2003 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network and the funding thereof, the Trieste-Divaca rail link is not considered to be a cross-border link, despite forming part of priority project No 6. Only 'cross-border' projects are eligible for Community grants amounting to 30% of the overall cost and, should this position be confirmed, the Trieste-Divaca link would lose out on a considerable amount of Community financial support. 1. Would the Commission agree that the decision not to include the Trieste-Divaca link among the cross-border projects goes against the interests of Community citizens by affecting the amount of financial support to be provided? 2. Given that the Trieste-Divaca link forms part of the Lyon-Trieste/Koper-Ljubljana-Divaca-Budapest line, what other characteristics does it require in order to be designated a 'cross-border' link and included in the list of cross-border projects?
