the level of protection for intellectual property rights within the European Union and hence creates a favourable legal environment for investments in brand-related activities. It also allows more easy control of parallel imports of counterfeit and pirated products from abroad. In the light of the abovementioned considerations, the Commission does not plan to change its existing regime of exhaustion of intellectual property rights. It does not envisage investigating further the price differences between the European Union and the United States. The Commission observes that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is neutral on this issue and does not make one exhaustion regime prevail over another one. The Commission is not aware that the ban on parallel imports would be an element in international trade agreements.
