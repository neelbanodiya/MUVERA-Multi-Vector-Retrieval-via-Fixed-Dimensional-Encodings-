("Operation and development of the Internal Market"). SUGGESTIONS The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Draws attention to the role of EU environmental policy in the attainment of the Lisbon and Gothenburg goals and the global objective of sustainable development; calls for more resources to be made available for the implementation and further development of EU environmental policy; 2. Points out that agricultural and structural policies have a huge impact on the environment; stresses that after enlargement the need to proceed to the greening of Community policies in practice by carrying out careful and methodologically sound assessments of environmental impacts in all policy areas is even more urgent than before; 3. Calls for standard use of environmental criteria in procurement procedures involving Community appropriations, such as invitations to tender and awarding contracts; 4.

U rges the Commission to dedicate adequate staff resources so that environmental programmes and policies can be implemented in both the old and the new Member States; 6. Points out that the EU plays a leading role in many international environmental agreements, such as the UN Climate Change Convention, the UN Biodiversity and Biosafety Convention and the Aarhus Convention on public participation and access to justice in environmental matters; points out that the pursuit of sustainable development and addressing numerous environmental problems require enhanced global cooperation; calls for more resources to be provided for international environmental activities so that the EU can maintain its lead in international environment policy and in setting the agenda for international cooperation; 7. Is convinced that public health should be considered as an essential part of the Lisbon agenda, as it contributes directly to the economic performance of Member States and the competitiveness of the EU as a whole; considers
