the candidates to this position One of the main priorities of the Committee in 2009 was the organisation of the hearings for the candidates to the position of the European Ombudsman. Members, many new to the Committee and even to the Parliament, managed to successfully accomplish their responsibilities. It is worthwhile mentioning that the first Report adopted by the new Committee concerned the activity of the European Ombudsman Report on the annual report on the European Ombudman's activities in 2008 ( 2009/2088(INI) ) by Chrysoula Paliadeli (A7/0020/2009). in 2008. It emphasised the role of the Ombudsman in protecting the interests of EU citizens in the face of the institutions and bodies of the European Union had evolved in the 14 years since the office was created, especially because of the independence of the institution itself and of the democratic scrutiny exercised by the European Parliament over the transparency of his activities. Members stressed their conviction that the role of the Ombudsman consisted in enhancing openness and accountability in the decision-making processes and administration of the European Union, therefore bringing an essential contribution towards a Union in which decisions were taken "as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen" Title I, Article 1, paragraph 2, of the Treaty on the Functioning of the Union (C115/ 9.05.2008, p .0016). . They called on the Ombudsman to pursue his efforts in raising awareness of his work and to promote his activities effectively. Conclusions If 2009 was a year of transition, 2010 announces to be a challenging year for the Committee. The Commission should present its draft regulation to the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the Citizens' Initiative and the Committee will provide an Opinion to the Report to be drafted by the Constitutional Affairs Committee. Moreover, the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon meant that the Charter of Fundamental Rights became legally binding. At this stage, it is difficult to predict how it will impact on the activity of the Committee, but fundamental rights do constitute one of the themes constantly invoked by petitioners. More clarifications on the application of the Charter are likely to be necessary in the near future.
