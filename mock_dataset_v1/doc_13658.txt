ORAL QUESTION H-1021/07 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jacky Hénin to the Commission Subject: Dangers of self-declaration for dangerous goods Flows of dangerous goods transported through the European Union are constantly increasing. In the period 1990-2002, there was a rise of 13%, with an increase in particular in dangerous goods carried by road (+27.4%) and also in waterway and maritime transport of goods (+11.1%). Transport operators are pressing for self-declaration for dangerous goods to become the norm. That would increase the risk of disasters occurring. The European Union has a responsibility here. It must take all necessary preventive measures. Does the Commission not intend to ban all forms of self-declaration for dangerous goods carried on Union territory, soundly applying the precautionary principle?
