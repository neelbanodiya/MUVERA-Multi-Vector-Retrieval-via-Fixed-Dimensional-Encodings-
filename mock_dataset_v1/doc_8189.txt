was reached at the Council in favour or against the Commission proposal. On 11 June 2009, EFSA published a statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants which concludes, in collaboration with scientists from EMEA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), that the previous assessment of EFSA on GM potato EH92-527-1 is in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the statement, and that no new evidence has become available that would prompt EFSA to change its previous opinion and thus reconfirms its previous positive assessment. When the analysis of this opinion was finalised, the Commission was already in the transitional period brought about by the delay in the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. It was, therefore, considered that it would be more appropriate to proceed with this authorisation when normal business would resume under the new College. Given the high scrutiny that was devoted to this dossier, given the fact that there were no new scientific issues which would have merited a further assessment and in view of the repeated scientific opinions, it was appropriate to proceed with this authorisation. Further details to the issues raised are provided in the recent replies to Written Questions E‑1545/10 , P‑1601/10 , P‑1617/10 , E‑1629/10 and E‑1777/10 to which the Honourable Member of the Parliament is kindly referred http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB .
