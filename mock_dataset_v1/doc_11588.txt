Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2010) EU relations with Ecuador are currently regulated by the framework Agreement on Cooperation of 1993 and the GSP+ scheme which has been autonomously granted by the EU to Ecuador as part of our development policy agenda. The framework of our bilateral relations was also updated in 2003 with the adoption of the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement which is still pending ratification in Greece and Colombia and has therefore not yet entered into force. The Commission started negotiating with the Andean Community for a region-to-region association agreement, including political dialogue, cooperation and trade, in June 2007. However, these negotiations were suspended in June 2008 after disagreement between Andean countries on approaches to a number of key trade issues became insurmountable. New negotiations for a Trade Agreement were launched in January 2009 between the EU and Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. In July 2009 Ecuador suspended its participation in the talks and negotiations therefore continued only with Peru and Colombia. Negotiations for the Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru have been recently finalised at technical level. That agreement is also open to the accession of other countries members of the CAN, including Ecuador. Recently, the latter has formally requested to re-join the negotiations of the trade agreement and the Commission has welcomed this news. The Ecuadorian administration and the Commission are planning to organise soon a technical meeting to assess prospects for re-starting the negotiations and agree on a way forward.
