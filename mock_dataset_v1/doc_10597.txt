Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (22 July 2011) Climate change is a global issue which requires urgent involvement of all major greenhouse emitters. The data released by the IEA are indeed a source of concern. The most recent scientific evidence (provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in the 2007 4th Assessment Report) shows that for the world to have a likely chance of keeping within the 2° Celsius (C) ceiling, global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) need to peak by 2020 at the latest, and be cut by at least 50 % of their 1990 levels by 2050. While in Copenhagen, countries representing more than 80 % of global emissions have pledged domestic targets, a recent United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) analysis shows that the Copenhagen pledges amount to only 60 % of the required emission reductions until 2020. Consequently, stronger global action is necessary to achieve emissions reductions that are in line with the 2°C ceiling. So far, the EU has set a strong example by its unilateral commitment to cut emissions in 2020 to at least 20 % below 1990 levels. From 1990 to 2010, EU emissions have already dropped 16 % while the economy has grown by 40 %. This proves that growth can go hand in hand with good climate policies. Emissions are increasing elsewhere. In China, emissions rose by up to 10 % in 2010 from the year before according to unofficial statistics. The Commission is working with China to help them reduce their energy intensity. In its recent Communication entitled ‘Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050’ COM(2011)112 final. , the Commission outlines the necessary steps to achieve 80 % to 95 % GHG emissions reductions by 2050 compared to 1990. This represents a longer term vision on Climate Action, consistent with the EU's contribution to limit the temperature increase below 2°C. As concerns energy efficiency, the Flagship initiative for a resource-efficient Europe also includes the ‘Energy Efficiency Plan 2011’ COM(2011)109 final. . The Plan puts forward ambitious measures for reaching the EU's 20 % energy saving target. If the EU delivers on its current policies, including its commitment to reach 20 % renewables, and achieve 20 % energy efficiency by 2020, this would enable the EU to outperform the current 20 % GHG emission reduction target and achieve a 25 %
