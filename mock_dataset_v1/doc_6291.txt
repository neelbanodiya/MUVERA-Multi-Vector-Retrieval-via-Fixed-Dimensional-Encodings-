WRITTEN QUESTION E-2186/05 by Richard Seeber (PPE-DE) to the Commission (21 June 2005) Subject: Compulsory registration/import into Croatia of yachts intended for commercial charter use A new Croatian law (Narodne novine No 181/2004) requires the import into Croatia and registration under the Croatian flag of all foreign vessels chartered in Croatia. Charter vessels already in Croatia have been granted a transitional period until 30 September 2005 during which temporary licences and customs entry will be used. A large number of the charter yachts already in Croatia are the property of foreign companies and are therefore listed as assets of these companies and registered abroad. However, the new law requires the removal of vessels from foreign registers in order for them to be chartered in Croatia. In the same way, the yachts must be sold in Croatia by these foreign firms. This means that the foreign firms involved must transfer from their assets part of their ‘hidden reserves’, which can lead to enormous tax burdens and problems with existing foreign financing. Registration in Croatia and removal from foreign registers, or the requirement for yachts to be imported into Croatia, clearly poses a serious threat to the free movement of goods between European countries. From 2005, all charter yachts must be listed on a register. This compulsory listing on the Croatian shipping register necessitates the payment of a fee, the level of which depends on whether the vessel was built in Croatia or abroad. HRK Boats up to 7 m Boats 7-12 m Yachts 12-15 m Yachts over 15 m Built in Croatia 50 150 10000 25000 Built abroad 2000 10000 30000 50000 With reference to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Croatia, of the other, what does the Commission intend to do about this discrimination against foreign‑built vessels in Croatia?
