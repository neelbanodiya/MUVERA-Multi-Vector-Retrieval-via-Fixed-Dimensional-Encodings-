WRITTEN QUESTION E-1536/06 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (7 April 2006) Subject: Quality of water for human consumption A study carried out by the OCU (Spanish Consumers’ and Users’ Organisation) in autumn 2005, revealed that harmful compounds, and specifically trihalomethanes, have been detected in the drinking water of six Spanish cities. The framework directive on the water sector lays down a limit of 100 micrograms of trihalomethanes per litre in drinking water, but Spain has a moratorium until 2009 which allows up to 150 micrograms per litre. However, Cáceres, Ciudad Real, Zamora, Alicante, Àvila and Murcia exceed even this maximum level. According to the OCU, trihalomethanes can, in the long term, cause lesions to the kidneys and liver. Is the Commission aware of the health risks of the high trihalomethane levels detected in drinking water in these Spanish cities? What representations is it going to make to the Spanish authorities with a view to improving the quality of drinking water in these cities?
