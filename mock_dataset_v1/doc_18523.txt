cooperation which can put a permanent end to the diversion of aid in favour of purposes which have nothing to do with development, as this diversion is made possible only by the extremely broad nature of the current official definition of development aid; 25. Calls on the Commission and the Members States to untie completely their aid, in particular technical assistance, food aid and food transport aid, in line with the OECD's DAC recommendation of 2001 for countries eligible under the EDF and with Article 31 of the DCI Regulation; 26. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to phase out policy-oriented conditionality, especially economic policy conditionality, to support a common understanding on key priorities, and to use their influence to convince the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support the same position; asks particularly that the "aid for trade" strategy benefit all developing countries, and not only those agreeing to a greater liberalisation of their markets, notably in the context of Economic Partnership Agreements; 27. Stresses the need for the international financial institutions and donor countries to publish the conditions for granting development aid, so that genuine democratic control can be exercised by parliaments, local authorities and civil society; 28. Acknowledges that ‘democratic ownership’ works both ways, and upholds the legitimacy of economic conditionality in the interests of Member States’ taxpayers, as manifested through their governments’ priorities; 29. Stresses the need to disburse aid according to partners´ own priorities and timetables, and conform to national planning and development priorities, or the national budgeting timeframe; 30. Stresses that better co-ordination between the Commission and the Member States should tackle the problem of orphan countries and sectors, and emphasises the relevance of an updated and refined version of the Donor Atlas in this connection; 31. Stresses the particular need for improvement of the health MDGs for situations of fragility and for the Commission's DG ECHO and DG Development to co-ordinate their work throughout the humanitarian aid phase, the transitional phase and the development phase (linking Relief, rehabilitation and development) as stated for instance in the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid; 32. Stresses the need to intensify the Commission's consultations with civil society partners in headquarters and in the field through better-structured meetings on policy, strategic programming and aid effectiveness issues including requirements for calls for proposals, disbursement procedures, financial control of projects, monitoring and evaluation processes;
