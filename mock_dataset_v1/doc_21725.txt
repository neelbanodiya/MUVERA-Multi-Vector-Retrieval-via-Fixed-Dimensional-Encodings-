ORAL QUESTION H-1037/05 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bill Newton Dunn to the Council Subject: Undemocratic lawmaking under the UK Presidency The UK Council Presidency set up an ‘ad-hoc group of experts’ which drew up a set of ‘Conclusions’ on the introduction of biometrics (fingerprints) and an RFID chip into national ID cards. It was intended to be adopted as an ‘A’ Point at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 1-2 December. ‘Conclusions’ are ‘soft-law’, non-binding, and not subject to any national or European parliamentary scrutiny. Does the President-in-Office of the Council agree that this is no way to bring in such a far-reaching policy, one which will affect millions of people? It is particularly objectionable that the Council is using a ‘proper’ EC committee to draw up the text of these Conclusions, without being accountable under the normal rules for these committees and exceeding the committee’s powers as set out in legislation. This method of decision-making has no place in a democracy.
