Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (10 September 2010) The Commission is closely following the case on Biomega Nutrición brought forward by Oceana and is also in close contacts with the Galician authorities which have launched a full administrative investigation in the allegations regarding the links between this company or its owners, and operators of vessels involved in IUU fishing activities. Should this investigation confirm the allegations, it will be the responsibility of the Galician authorities to use the tools available under the IUU Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999, OJ L 286, 29.10.2008 . , including not granting public funding to the incriminated operators. In addition, it should be noted that imports of fishery products into the EU from any IUU listed fishing vessel is prohibited under the IUU Regulation. If the flag of the IUU listed vessel is from a Member State, catches and prohibited gear must be confiscated if the vessel enters an EU port. Shark liver oil or any other fish oil is exempt from the requirements of a catch certificate under the IUU Regulation as no evidence was available on IUU practices related to obtaining this product. Given that fish oil is not included in Chapter 03 or in tariff headings 1604 or 1605, including such products under the catch certification scheme would require an amendment of the IUU Regulation. The Commission is committed to continuing its efforts to fight against IUU fishing and will explore how current mechanisms of cross-compliance can be further reinforced in the context of the upcoming reform of the common fisheries policy.
