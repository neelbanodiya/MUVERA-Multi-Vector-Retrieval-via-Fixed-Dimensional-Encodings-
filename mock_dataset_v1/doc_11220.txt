Reply (15 September 2008) The Council is not aware of the case in question. The issue of the investment climate in Russia is a recurring theme in the political dialogue between the EU and Russia, and is brought up regularly at various levels, including Summits. Also, an Investment Dialogue has been in place with Russia since October 2007, aimed at improving and simplifying the administrative and regulatory environment for investments and increasing its transparency. On a general note, the European Union's aim is to ensure that provisions establishing clear rules for EU investors in Russia and safeguarding their rights are included in the New Agreement which is now being negotiated with Russia to replace the partnership and cooperation agreement currently in force.
