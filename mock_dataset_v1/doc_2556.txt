ORAL QUESTION H-0046/10 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Laima Liucija Andrikienė to the Commission Subject: The impact of the 'banana agreement' on the EU's domestic banana producers The EU has recently reached a historic agreement in the World Trade Organisation with Latin American countries on lowering tariffs for banana imports from that region. This historic agreement will, however, have a negative impact on the EU’s own banana producers, as they will have to face tougher competition from Latin American banana producers. Does the Commission intend to develop policy mechanisms to protect European banana producers in areas such as the Canary Islands and Madeira?
