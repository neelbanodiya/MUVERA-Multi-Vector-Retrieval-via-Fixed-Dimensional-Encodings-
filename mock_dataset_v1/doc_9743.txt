on 3 October 2002 recommends to promote primary prevention responses, to strengthen responses for victims of violence and to increase collaboration and exchange of information on violence prevention. ( 5 ) These principles are recognised in numerous conventions, declarations and protocols claimed by the main International Institutions such as the United Nations, the International Labour Organisation, the World Conference on Women and the World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children. This important work performed by international organisations should be complemented by that of the European Union. Indeed, Article 3(p) of the Treaty requires Community action to include a contribution to the attainment of a high level of health protection.
