reinforce the protection of passengers and their dependants. Recital 11 provides that a Community air carrier can only avail itself of unlimited liability in the case where it can prove that the damage was not due to the negligence or other wrongful act or omission of the carrier or its servant or agents. The Council and the Commission entered a joint statement to the common position, stating that as damages caused in the context of air carriage may possibly result in liability both under the Montreal Convention or Regulation 2027/97 and the Package Tour Directive, this issue needs to be clarified. The proposal for a Regulation, as amended by the co-legislators in the good spirit of co-operation, has been improved considerably, is now more balanced and clearly reduces the legal uncertainties. The consumers will be better informed of their rights when travelling by air. The air passengers travelling with Community air carriers will have the best available protection as regards air carrier liability. Thus, your Rapporteur estimates that there is no need to propose additional amendments.
