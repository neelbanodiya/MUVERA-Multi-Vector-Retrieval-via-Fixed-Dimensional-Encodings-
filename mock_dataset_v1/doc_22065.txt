WRITTEN QUESTION E-0172/07 by José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (24 January 2007) Subject: Energy performance in buildings Energy performance in buildings is measured using various factors, including their capacity to produce their own energy. In accordance with Directive 2002/91/EC OJ L 1, 4.1.2003, p. 65. , all new buildings must meet its objectives, in particular the minimum energy performance requirements. This applies to both completely new constructions and major renovations. By optimising energy use and promoting energy generation systems, consumption will tend to fall, thereby reducing dependency on the usual suppliers. Whilst Portugal is among the EU countries with the highest rate of solar exposure, it is also the country with the highest gas charges and the fourth highest electricity charges in the EU. Can the Commission answer the following questions: — Will the objectives of this directive be achieved in Portugal? If so, to what extent? — Does it have any indicators relating to the performance of the state and private individuals in this connection? — Does it believe that sufficient measures have been taken to make the best possible use of Portugal's specific climatic conditions in relation to energy use in buildings? — What new measures does it suggest?
