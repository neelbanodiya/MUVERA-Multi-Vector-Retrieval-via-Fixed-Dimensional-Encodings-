Financial support for economic development in Northern Cyprus is increased in the PDB by some EUR 20 million up to a total of EUR 138.8 million for 2006, compared to the EUR 120 million agreed between Parliament and Council in the context of Amending letter 1/2005 at the budgetary Conciliation of 25 November 2004. The amount in the PDB remains in the reserve pending adoption of legal basis.
