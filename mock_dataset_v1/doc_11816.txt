next. It should also be emphasised that a great many of the rules concerning the right to family reunification, which in part transcend national legislation, derive from the international legal framework, the most important legal instruments of which are: - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights; - The 1996 international pacts on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; - Convention No 143 of the International Labour Organisation; - The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and their Families, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 1990; - The final act of the Conference adopting the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951; - The Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989; - The European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which is of prime importance since Article 8 thereof enshrines the right to respect for private and family life, and Article 12 enshrines the right to marry and to found a family; - The European Social Charter; - The European Convention of 1977 on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proclaimed in Nice on 7 December 2000, also recognises the right to respect for private and family life (Article 7) and the right to marry and to found a family (Article 9). The extent to which each of these instruments is legally binding varies greatly since some Conventions have only been ratified by a few Member States, while others have not even entered into force owing to non-ratification. Nevertheless, all of them recognise the right to family reunification and award prime consideration to the best interests of the child. Of particular importance in this area is the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, which has not recognised an unrestricted right to the reunification of third-country nationals legally resident in a Member State and their family members. However, the case law of the Court restricts the discretionary exercising of powers by public authorities in the field of the control of entry into national territory and in cases of expulsion. It was for this reason that the Tampere European Council of 15 and 16 October 1999 emphasised the need to guarantee fair treatment of third-country nationals legally resident in the Member States.
