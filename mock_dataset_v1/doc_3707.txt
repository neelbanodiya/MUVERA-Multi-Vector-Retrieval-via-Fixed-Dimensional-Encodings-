Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (10 January 2007) It is for Member States (or their competent local authorities) to define public services and to choose the appropriate legal instruments to ensure the provision of such services, provided that the definition of such services and the design of such instruments comply with EC law. In particular, such services shall respond to a need not already satisfied spontaneously by the market, and such instruments shall be transparent, non discriminatory, and comply with the state aid provisions of the EC Treaty and with the relevant sectoral legislation (in this case, in particular, the regulation on maritime cabotage and its interpreting communication). The Commission, therefore, does not insist on the use of one or another specific instrument (PSC or PSO) but will check that any measure taken complies with EC law. If the competent authority chooses a public service contract, awarded in the present case after a public tender, this contract can foresee a subsidy compensating for the cost of such services. If this subsidy complies with the four criteria laid down by the Court of Justice in its judgment in the case of Altmark Trans GmbH, then this subsidy would not constitute state aid. If this is not the case, this subsidy could be considered by the Commission to constitute compatible state aid if it complies with the applicable legislation and principles, as recalled in particular in the Commission Decision 2005/842/EC of 28 November 2005 2005/842/EC: Commission decision of 28 November 2005 on the application of Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty to state aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest , OJ L (2005) 312. or in the Community framework for state aid in the form of public service compensation OJ C (2005) 297. . In any case, the subsidy would have to be limited to the compensation of the public service costs, transparent and based on a clear pre-existing definition of the services.
