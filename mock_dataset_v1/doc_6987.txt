Regulation 295/91 has not led to any problems and it is unclear why the Commission wishes to modify it now. When the Commission proposed the same revision in 1998 it kept the definition unchanged. Amendment 8 Article 2, point (h a) (new) (ha) ‘force majeure’, i.e. unusual and unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of the party by whom it is pleaded, the consequences of which could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised, for example political instability, extreme meteorological conditions, inadequate security, unexpected flight safety shortcomings and long strikes of essential services. Justification It is necessary to clarify this concept for air transport owing to the specific requirements in this field. Amendment 9 Article 2, point (h b) (new) (hb) ‘denied boarding’ means a refusal to accommodate passengers on a flight although they have a valid ticket, in paper or electronic form, a confirmed reservation on that flight, and have presented themselves at the check-in desk within the required time limit and as stipulated other than in circumstances where boarding is denied for disruptive behaviour, health and safety reasons or inadequate travel documentation; Justification The regulation should contain a definition of ‘denied boarding’ which takes account, for instance, of the fact that the absence or non-validity of an identity document or other safety concerns are valid reasons for refusing to transport passengers and should not be considered cases of denied boarding. Amendment 10 Article 2, point (h c) (new) (hc) ‘volunteer’ means a person who has a valid ticket, in paper or electronic form, a confirmed reservation on that flight, who presented themselves at the check-in desk within the required time limit and as stipulated, and who responds positively to the carrier's call for passengers prepared to surrender their confirmed reservation in exchange for compensation; Justification It is preferable to keep to the definition of ‘volunteer’ given in the regulation currently in force. Amendment 11 Article 2, point (h d) (new) (hd) ‘cancelled flights’ means flights which are not made, but are listed in the computerised reservation system during the seven days preceding the expected departure; Justification The proposal for a regulation covers cancelled flights but does not propose any definition for them. A clear text requires such a definition. Amendment 12 Article 2, point (h e) (new) (he) ‘a person with reduced mobility’ means any person whose mobility is reduced due to any physical
