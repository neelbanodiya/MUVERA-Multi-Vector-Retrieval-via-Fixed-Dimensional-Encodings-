Question for written answer E-012560/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 János Áder (PPE) (10 January 2012) Subject: Greenhouse gas emission According to the key GHG data published by the European Environment Agency, greenhouse gas emissions tended to increase in 2010 compared to 2009 in 20 Member States. A small reduction in emissions could only be seen in 6 countries: Greece, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Cyprus and Bulgaria. This is a very regrettable development, all the more so in view of the fact that four of the six best performing Member States (PT, IE, EL, ES) in terms of GHG emission reduction were the eurozone Member States that were most severely hit by the economic crisis. In my opinion, an economic downturn should not be a precondition for an efficient GHG reduction policy. Currently, however, EEA data seem to reflect such a correlation. 1. Could you provide me with an explanation concerning the worsening performance of the 20 Member States referred to above with regard to the GHG emission reduction targets? 2. In the light of the most recent developments (2010), what are the possible achievements at EU level until the end of 2012? 3. Could you provide me with the GHG emission forecast data for 2011, broken down by countries?
