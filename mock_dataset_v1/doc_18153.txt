WRITTEN QUESTION E-2012/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (26 March 2009) Subject: Information on the use of the LIFE+ financial instrument by the municipality of Prato For the Community programming period 2007‑13 numerous financing programmes have been developed; with these programmes the European Union intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. One of these is the 6th EAP (Sixth Community Environment Action Programme). To implement this programme, the LIFE+ financial instrument was established with the general aim of helping to shape Community environmental policy and legislation and thus to promote sustainable development in the EU. In this connection, the municipality of Prato (Tuscany, Italy) requires EU funding to promote sustainable development. Can the Commission clarify whether the municipality of Prato has received financing through LIFE+? If so, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Prato used the funds in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether the subsidies had to be reimbursed?
