people sign these proposals". Minimum number of citizens per country The Commission proposal would require each initiative to be supported by a minimum number of signatures per Member State. A threshold would be fixed for each Member State which is "degressively proportional" to its population. The minimum limit would be 4,500 signatures (for Malta, Estonia and Cyprus). In Germany, the biggest EU country, 72,000 signatures would be required. "We looked into how the European Parliament works when we proposed this principle", explained Commissioner Šefčovič, adding that the aim is to ensure balanced participation by various countries. Admissibility check Andrew Duff (ALDE, UK), felt that the Commission should not have to wait until 300,000 signatures have been collected before checking whether a proposal falls within the EU's sphere of competence. However, Commissioner Šefčovič defended this proposal, stressing that "we need clear proof that there is a solid public support" before checking on admissibility. "An independent legal entity, such as a committee of experts or the Court of Justice, should be responsible for this procedure", and not the Commission, argued Alain Lamassoure (EPP, FR). Right to appeal "Once expectations have been raised so high, this could prove explosive", warned Rafał Trzaskowski (EPP, PL), adding that "if an initiative is rejected by the Commission, this will create a huge political problem", since many people may then want to go to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Maroš Šefčovič confirmed that, if an initiative is declared inadmissible, the person or group who has presented it will have the right to appeal to the ECJ. The Constitutional Affairs Committee will appoint shortly a rapporteur for the citizens' initiative.
