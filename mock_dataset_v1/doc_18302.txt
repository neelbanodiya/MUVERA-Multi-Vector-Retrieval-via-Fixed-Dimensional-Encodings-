P5_TA(2000)0180 Financial markets A5-0059/2000 European Parliament resolution on the Commission communication on implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan ( COM(1999) 232 - C5-0114/1999 - 1999/2117(COS) ) The European Parliament, - having regard to the Commission communication ( COM(1999) 232 - C5-0114/1999 ), - having regard to its resolution of 4 May 1999 OJ C 270, 24.9.1999, p. 7. on an earlier Commission communication on Financial Services: Building a Framework for Action ( COM(1998) 625 - C4-0688/1998 ), - having regard to Rule 47(1) of its Rules of Procedure, - having regard to the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the opinions of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy ( A5-0059/2000 ), A. whereas the Commission communication entitled “Implementing the framework for financial markets: Action Plan” is the basis for a future working programme in this field, which will take the form of 43 concrete measures, to be adopted over a five-year period with a view to deriving maximum benefit from the introduction of the euro and guaranteeing the stability and competitiveness of the Union's financial markets, B. whereas the strategic objectives set out in the Action Plan (a single EU wholesale market, open and secure retail markets, state-of-the-art prudential rules and supervision and wider conditions for an optimal single financial market) may be summarised under two headings, namely to develop further the internal market in technical services (liberalisation of the sector) and to improve a number of technical aspects (reduction of systemic risk and/or improvement of the forecasting system for those risks while also facilitating the conclusion of transactions), C. whereas much progress needs to be made before a genuine single market in retail financial services exists in the EU; whereas numerous impediments to competition exist through, inter alia, failure to implement and enforce existing legislation and differing national interpretations of existing directives, D. whereas, while it is universally agreed that consolidating the single market in financial services means removing the barriers to its smooth operation, a number of major discrepancies still exist as regards listing those barriers, inter alia because the Commission has never spelt them out in detail, E. whereas the Commission believes that the EU should strive to maintain the highest standards of prudential financial market regulation, which
