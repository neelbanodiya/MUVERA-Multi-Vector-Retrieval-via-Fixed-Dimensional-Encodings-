competitive environment for energy by unbundling supply and distribution functions, while at the same time ensuring competition between distributors; 18. Considers that the evolution of the Kyoto framework after 2012 needs active consideration now, to allow the markets to take into account the cost of carbon in major investment programmes, recognising that European competitiveness and growth are already being challenged by higher labour and electricity costs; SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SOURCES 19. Urges the Commission to propose concrete measures on energy and invest urgently and massively in a truly energy-efficient economy in order to diminish drastically our dependency on fossil fuels; urges the Commission furthermore to always insist on the key role that energy conservation and energy efficiency have in reducing energy dependency; 20. Stresses the exceptional importance of renewable energy sources, along with energy efficiency, for a European energy policy for future energy supplies; asks the Commission and the Council, therefore, to come forward with new, ambitious targets after 2010 and actions in this field to guarantee faster development in every Member State; insists that there should be a directive on heating and cooling from renewables, as decided by the European Parliament, to ensure further market penetration by renewables in the heating sector; 21. Reaffirms its strong support for RES, calls on Member States to redouble efforts to achieve the targets of a 12% share of total energy consumption and 22.1% of electricity from RES by 2010 and welcomes the adoption of the Directive on electricity from RES; 22. Welcomes the new initiatives by the Commission in its Biomass Action Plan and the proposal for biofuels and calls on all EU institutions to speed up efforts to use the potential of renewables from biomass while paying due attention to environmental considerations; 23. Considers it urgent that the Commission should submit proposals and work with the industry to hasten the application of hydrogen and fuel cells to bring about sustained, long-term improvements in energy efficiency and conservation in the transport sector; notes that biomass in general can help meet energy needs in the Union by conventional combustion; in calls on the Commission, view of the benefits from the additional income for the agriculture and forestry sector, to implement a crash programme for the earliest possible organisation of production, collection of agricultural and forest residues, pyrolysis and use of the gas produced; 24. Recognises the growing importance of gas, as its share in
