WRITTEN QUESTION E-5650/09 by Charles Tannock (ECR) to the Commission (24 November 2009) Subject: The dangers and absurdities of the UK's Health and Safety culture It was recently reported in the UK press that an ambulance crew trying to save a nine-year old car crash victim were told by their operator that a back-up crew could not be sent until the remaining minutes of their lunch break had been completed. Horrified, the attending crew contacted their colleagues directly, who immediately came to help. Fortunately, the little girl survived. Contemporaneous reports emerged of an old lady who had been kept waiting in the cold for half an hour outside a residential home because the person with the correct qualifications could not be found to permit access to the building. Several years ago, national outrage erupted when it emerged that two policemen had been prevented from saving a drowning boy because they did not have the correct swimming qualifications. Employees often want to do what is right, but the overly rigid, bureaucratic Health and Safety culture spawned by the British Government has also produced absurdities that belong in Monty Python sketches. A television report, for example, revealed that some local authorities had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on mini-scaffolding to prop up gravestones of normal size because they were adjudged to constitute a health risk. Will the Commission consider amending future Health and Safety directives to ensure that rules can never be used to sanction protocols that threaten human life or generate a wasteful and disproportionate use of scarce resources where there is no clear risk of danger?
