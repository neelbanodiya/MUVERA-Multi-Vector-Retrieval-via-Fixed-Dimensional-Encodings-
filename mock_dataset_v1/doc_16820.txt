of the stepping-stone Agreement reaffirms the main commitment from the Cotonou Agreement for human right, democratic principles, good governance and the rule of law; your Rapporteur wishes to see further clear commitment established in those areas in the final EPA. Various development cooperation provisions identify priority areas of development cooperation to accompany the implementation of the stepping-stone EPA. The Preamble includes a reference to the importance to the development objectives agreed at the international level and to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Your Rapporteur recalls the commitment taken in the EU Strategy on Aid for Trade to increase the collective EU trade related assistance to € 2 billion annually by 2010 (€ 1 billion from the Community, € 1 billion from the Member States); the Parliament wishes to see, in addition, quantified and time-bound commitments regarding funding, which ensure that Côte d'Ivoire can adjust to the changes. Finally states, in cases where Parliament withholds assent for the conclusion of an international agreement, Council or Commission are obliged to inform the partner countries that the Community does not intend to conclude the agreement. This should result in a termination of the provisional application of the agreement: Article 25(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties holds that "Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the negotiating States have otherwise agreed, the provisional application of a treaty or a part of a treaty with respect to a State shall be terminated if that State notifies the other States between which the treaty is being applied provisionally of its intention not to become a party to the treaty." When the Council takes a decision on provisional application it takes political responsibility of provisionally applying an agreement which it knows can be rejected at a later stage by Parliament and that thereby its provisional application would have to be ended without the agreement coming into force. 10.3.2009 OPINION of the Committee on Development (*) for the Committee on International Trade on the proposal for a Council decision concluding the stepping stone Economic Partnership Agreement between Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part (5535/2009 - COM(2008)0439 – C6‑0064/2009 – 2008/0136(AVC) ) Rapporteur: Johan Van Hecke (*) Associated committee – Rule 47 of the Rules of Procedure SHORT JUSTIFICATION In 2000, the ACP and EU agreed to replace the existing regime
