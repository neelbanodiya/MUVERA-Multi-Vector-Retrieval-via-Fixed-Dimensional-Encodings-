Question for written answer E-000837/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (1 February 2012) Subject: Standard sizes for cabin baggage on aircraft Would the Commission consider imposing standard sizes for cabin baggage on aircraft, so that passengers could buy one cabin bag which would meet the requirements of every airline operating at EU airports? Passengers at the moment never know if the cabin bag they have purchased will fit the specific baggage dimensions of all airlines they will use. A standard size would allow all bag manufacturers to meet the EU standards, and therefore passengers would have greater certainty when arriving at the airport that they will not have to pay excessive hold charges because their small bag is the wrong shape but would still comfortably fit in the overhead bins.
