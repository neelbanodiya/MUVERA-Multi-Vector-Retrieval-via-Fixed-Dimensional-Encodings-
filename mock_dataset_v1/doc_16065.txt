Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (13 February 2007) The situation described by the Honourable Member has existed since the start of the common organisation of the market in wine in 1970. This has not prevented the European Union adopting legal measures in technical fields such as the Community methods for the analysis of wines consistent with the practices recognised by the OIV. In its communication ‘Towards a sustainable European wine sector’ of 22 June 2006 COM(2006)319 final. , the Commission proposes to strengthen the links between Community law and the OIV by proposing the recognition of OIV decisions on oenological practices after filtering by the Commission. Following the new agreement of 3 April 2001 in Paris, which reorganised the OIV, the new rules of procedures of this organisation, adopted in 2004, allow for the full membership of intergovernmental organisations. In these circumstances, the Commission is actively studying the possibility to obtain a more active and more structured participation of the Community at an official level in the work of the OIV.
