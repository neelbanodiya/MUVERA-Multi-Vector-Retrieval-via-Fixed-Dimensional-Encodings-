years after the scheduled starting date must be cancelled. RAL 2005 (outstanding commitments/reste à liquider) 18. The total stock of RAL at the end of 2004 was €73,28 billion, which has, to date (Sept 05), risen to EUR 92,2 billion. As a comparison, at the end of 2003 the figure was EUR 69,3 billion which then rose to some EUR 80 billion in September 2004. As the majority of payment claims will come towards the end of the year, the rapporteurs stress that an overall increase is therefore normal in the first part of the year and, essentially, corresponds to "normal" RAL as a consequence of the cycle of structural actions spending. The rapporteurs nevertheless ask the Commission to comment on the current overall trend. It could also be noted that, as late as the end of 2003, the RAL on the pre-2000 programmes still accounted for 15% of the total. 19. The outstanding commitments associated with 2000-2006 programmes increased by some €7 billion in 2004 (€8.3 billion in 2003). In relative terms though (the RAL in proportion to an average annual commitment tranche) the RAL was reduced, from 1.77 by the end of 2003 to 1.7 by the end of 2004. Conclusions 20. Your rapporteurs wish to underline the high implementation rates for the Structural Funds and the positive result of the implementation of the n+2 rule. The implementation rates in 2005 are good and it was already clear, since some time back, that the Amending Budget to reinforce payments would be necessary. 21. The rapporteurs naturally stress that this expected Amending Budget for the final payment needs in 2005 will also play an important role in assessing the needs for 2006. 22. The budget should be based on real needs. The rapporteurs can reasonably predict that higher payment appropriations will be necessary. The rapporteurs finally note that the difference of over EUR 9 billion between the Commission's budget proposal and the Member States forecasts is too big to be justified. They therefore call for increasing the payment appropriations for the Structural Actions for the year 2006.
