Question for written answer P-011950/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Zuzana Roithová (PPE) (14 December 2011) Subject: Merging the Youth in Action programme The Commission plans to merge the Youth in Action programme with other educational and vocational programmes. However, the planned activities under the prospective Erasmus for All programme do not cover all existing activities targeting and serving European young people. Of the 6 787 individuals and organisations participating in the Youth in Action programme, 87 % expressed their opinion during the mid‑term evaluation of the programme, and their clear preference is for the programme to continue as an independent action. Parliament clearly supported that position in its resolution of 12 May 2011 on Youth on the Move: — a framework for improving Europe’s education and training systems ( P7_TA(2011)0230 ). Accordingly, so as to maintain the existing efficient and value-adding structure, has the Commission changed its plans to merge the Youth in Action programme, which is running well, with other programmes?
