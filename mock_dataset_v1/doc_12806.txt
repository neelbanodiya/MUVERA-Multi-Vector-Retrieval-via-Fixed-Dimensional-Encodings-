Question for written answer E-010329/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) (14 November 2011) Subject: University fees What classifies someone as an ‘EU citizen’ is extremely ambiguous due to the clear variance in nationality laws across EU Member States. According to some of these laws, it is possible to claim EU citizenship through a parent, or sometimes a grandparent, despite never having been domiciled in either that Member State or in the EU itself. However, as EU citizens are entitled to receive university education in institutions in Member States other than that of which they claim citizenship, and at the same price as students from that Member State, there is an increasing risk that these lax nationality laws will be open for abuse by students claiming EU citizenship from outside the European Union purely in order to obtain access to our education sector. I would be interested to know the Commission’s view on this conundrum and whether there has been any formal assessment of the issue.
