WRITTEN QUESTION E-3587/06 by Sharon Bowles (ALDE) to the Commission (31 July 2006) Subject: Water efficiency in buildings Can the Commission kindly complete its response on Written Question E‑1906/06, from which the following parts were not answered. 1. Is the Commission considering to come forward with an initiative like Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings, for water efficiency in buildings? If not, why not? 2. Does the Commission believe that, in addition to increasing awareness amongst EU citizens about using water sensibly, further action at the EU level may be necessary — in particular, to encourage the installation of more efficient water-using equipment in buildings, (thereby covering private homeowners, social housing providers and businesses)?
