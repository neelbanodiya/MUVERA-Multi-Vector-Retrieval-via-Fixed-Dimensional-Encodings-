ORAL QUESTION H-0204/09 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2009 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Daniel Bautista to the Commission Subject: Commissioner Louis Michel's visit to Cuba Can the Commission explain why Commissioner Louis Michel systematically ignores Cuban dissidents during his visits to Cuba, including his latest visit in March 2009, and meets only the Cuban authorities, which is in clear breach of the mandate given in the Council's conclusions of June 2008, according to which European authorities visiting Cuba should pursue a dialogue with the democratic opposition in Cuba and address, in their discussions with the Cuban authorities, the issue of respect for human rights, the transition to a pluralist democracy on the island and the demand for the immediate release of all political prisoners, including those detained during the 'Black Spring' of 2003?
