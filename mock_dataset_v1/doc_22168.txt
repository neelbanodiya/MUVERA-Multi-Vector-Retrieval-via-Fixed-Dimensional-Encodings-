the necessary preventive action against the severe damage being caused by this company to the local society and economy? Has the Commission taken action to prevent this serious damage? Has it taken any steps to institute the necessary surveillance and monitoring to stop the attempts to consolidate the woodpulp factory in its present location by building a new paper manufacturing plant in association with the Georgia Pacific Corporation? Is the Commission aware that Celulosas de Pontevedra even wishes to end the publicly-owned status of the 430 000 m 2 of coastal land on which its factory is located, with the aim of continuing its activities after the expiry of its administrative concession? Will the Commission support the Pontevedra municipal council in its campaign to defend the publicly-owned status of the land occupied by the factory and have the factory moved elsewhere, in a context of job preservation and implementation of all the measures required to put an end to the present unacceptable pollution?
