Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (27 April 2011) Under the terms of Directive 2003/20/EC OJ L 115, 9.5.2003. relating to compulsory use of safety belts in vehicles of less than 3.5 tonnes, Member States require all occupants of vehicles in circulation to use the safety devices (safety belts and child restraints) with which the vehicles are fitted. Children aged three and over and under 150 cm in height must occupy a seat other than a front seat and must be restrained by a child-restraint system. Like any other relevant vehicle, motorhomes shall also be fitted with seatbelts on designated seating positions. These designated seating positions are not only located in the front, but normally also in the so-called living accommodation compartment of motorhomes. Appendix 1 to Annex XI of Directive 2007/46/EC OJ L 263, 9.10.2007. as amended, prescribes that those seats which are not designated for use when the vehicle is travelling on the road shall be clearly identified to users either by means of a pictogram or a sign with an appropriate text. Subsequently, approved child restraint systems can and shall be used where children are being transported on designated seating positions.
