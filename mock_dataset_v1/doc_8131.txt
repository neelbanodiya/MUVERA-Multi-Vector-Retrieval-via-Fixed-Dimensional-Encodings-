Question for written answer E-3742/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nigel Farage (EFD) (27 May 2010) Subject: Restitution of property in Croatia I refer to the Commission’s ‘Staff Working-Document’ SEC(2009)1333, Brussels, 14.10.2009, ‘Croatia 2009, Progress-Report’. In Section 2.2 of the above document, ‘Human Rights and The Protection of Minorities’, on page 14, under the heading ‘Property-Rights’, we read that ‘the outstanding cases of delayed property‑repossessions, and problems with compensation, for the use of private property taken under the war-legislation from the 1990s, continue to be present’ (my italics). Since the restitution of property in Croatia is not referred to anywhere else in this report, would it not be appropriate to insert a reference at this point to (a) the processes of restitution of, and compensation for, property expropriated under Communist rule in Croatia after World War II, which are making only slow progress; (b) serious shortcomings, which the Croatian government has not fully addressed, in the law relating to the above processes, in that — although amended in 2002, this law still discriminates against foreign nationals, whose applications for restitution are automatically rejected by the administrative authorities; and — this law only allows claims from those who were originally deprived of property, or from their immediate descendants, whereas the rightful ownership of property is not necessarily dependent on the degree of relationship between a claimant and the original owner?
