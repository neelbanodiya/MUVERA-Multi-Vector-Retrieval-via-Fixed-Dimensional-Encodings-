WRITTEN QUESTION E-0663/10 by Frieda Brepoels (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 February 2010) Subject: Coffee and Fair Trade labelling in public procurement Following similar cases in the Netherlands, the coffee manufacturer Douwe Egberts has become involved in a dispute with the province of Flemish Brabant. Douwe Egberts argues that one of the criteria laid down, namely the question of Fair Trade or similar labelling, contravenes European law. In press release IP/09/1618 of 29 October 2009, the Commission requests that the Netherlands review the contract for supply and management of coffee machines in the province of North Holland. The Commission states that the award procedure did not meet the requirements flowing from Directive 2004/18/EC OJ L 134, 30.4.2004, p. 114 . and thereby restricted competition. The Commission viewed it as problematic that the province did not set any clear criteria that could clarify to potential tenderers whether a product was comparable, and that the criteria were therefore not transparent for tenderers. In this context, I put the following questions to the Commission: 1. Has the Government of the Netherlands now responded to the Commission’s ‘reasoned opinion’? If so, what was the outcome? If not, what are the next steps? 2. Is the Commission considering providing a guide for best practices on sustainability criteria in public procurement? If so, when can this be expected? If not, why not, and what alternative approach would the Commission propose? 3. Applying sustainability criteria in public procurement is also recognised by Europe as a priority. What freedom do (local) authorities have to set criteria that a tender must fulfil? 4. Will the Commission take further complementary initiatives on sustainability criteria in public procurement? If so, what are these initiatives, and when are they planned? If not, why not?
