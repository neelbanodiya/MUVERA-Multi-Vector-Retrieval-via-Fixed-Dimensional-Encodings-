Question for written answer E-000812/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Britta Reimers (ALDE) (4 February 2011) Subject: Duties on imports of oats into the EU In Germany over 600 000 tonnes of oats a year are harvested, less than 20% of which, however, are suitable for use in food production, including in oat mills. In addition to locally produced oats, around 200 000 tonnes therefore have to be imported, mainly from Finland and Sweden. Partly in view of the financially more attractive growing of bio‑energy crops, both the areas devoted to the growing of oats and yields for oats are steadily falling. This trend is worrying in terms of security of supply of oats in Europe and in terms of allowing oat mills to plan ahead with confidence. 1. Is the Commission aware of this problem and is it considering making it easier to import oats, for example by temporarily or permanently reducing import duties? 2. In 2008 a temporary reduction in import duties on other cereals was introduced. Why was this not the case for oats? 3. Would the current market situation, in contrast to that in 2008, justify treating oats in the same way as other types of cereal?
