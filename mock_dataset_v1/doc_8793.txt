ORAL QUESTION H-0041/06 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Carlos Carnero González to the Commission Subject: Maintaining or modifying the decision to reduce the number of Spanish translators at the Commission On 18 January 2006 the Commission replied to my written question P-4568/05 on the reduction of the number of Spanish translators in its services. I do not agree with the arguments advanced in Commissioner Figel's reply, and I feel it does not provide a full answer as to whether the Commission is maintaining the plans made public in early November 2005, which entailed, inter alia, an unacceptable reduction in the numbers of Spanish translators which takes no account of such crucial factors as the number of Spanish speakers and the remarkable growth of the language both within and outside the Union. Can the Commission state whether it intends to continue with those plans or whether it has decided to modify them in line with public opinion, the stand taken by the Spanish government and my own position, in order to avoid damaging the remarkable value added represented for the Union by the use of Spanish as one of its main official languages and ensure it is not discriminated against by comparison with English, French and German?
