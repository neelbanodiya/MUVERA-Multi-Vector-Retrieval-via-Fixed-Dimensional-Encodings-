As regards the format of petitions, one may speak of a confirmation: petitioners are more inclined to submit their petitions by using the internet form rather than the traditional letter-type format (62.6% of the petitions received in 2009 were sent via e-mail against 59.2 % in 2008). 2009 Petition Format Number of petitions % e-mail 1,204 62.6 Letter 720 37.4 2008 Petition Format Number of petitions % e-mail 1,117 59.2 Letter 769 40.8 While they do represent a useful instrument allowing the Committee to assess its yearly activity, statistics should nevertheless be read carefully given that several elements are likely to influence the overall results - i.e. petitions can concern one or several fields, one or several countries; they can be submitted by individuals or associations and in some cases they can take the form of campaigns with numerous accompanying signatures; in addition, petitioners can choose to submit documents in their mother tongue or any other official language of the Union. Nonetheless, statistics prove that the conclusions of previous annual reports remain valid. Thus, as already mentioned, most of the petitions declared inadmissible show that confusion persists in respect to the European and national competences, the EU institutions and those of the Council of Europe, in particular the Court of Human Rights. Therefore, previous calls for stepping up the efforts aiming to better inform citizens of what the petitions process is all about and what can be achieved when submitting a petition to Parliament are as current as ever. One path to be explored could be the improvement of the webpage dedicated to Petitions on the portal of the European Parliament so that citizens submitting petitions online receive all the necessary information about the competences of the Parliament, the assessment of petitions, the work of the Committee and the possibilities of obtaining faster redress by using other networks available to them at EU or national level (SOLVIT, European Consumer Network, European Ombudsman, national Ombudsmen or the national parliamentary committees on petitions). Previous Reports called for clearly signposting the various complaints mechanisms available to citizens at EU level by establishing a one-stop shop which could offer citizens guidance when they look for solutions to alleged breaches of their rights. It does remain a very important objective to reach. The initiative of the European Commission to regroup the formal and informal mechanisms of complaint under the Your Rights page of the europa.eu
