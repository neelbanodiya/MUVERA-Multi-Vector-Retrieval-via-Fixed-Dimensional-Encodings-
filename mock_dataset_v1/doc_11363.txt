WRITTEN QUESTION E-4423/07 by David Martin (PSE) to the Commission (18 September 2007) Subject: Pets' Passports Certain case studies have been brought to my attention recently of the high costs to EU citizens of the operation of the ‘Pets’ Passports' scheme when carrying pets between the UK and continental Europe. In brief, vets in the Calais area have apparently doubled the fees they charge for inspections required by the Passports scheme in recent years, and are alleged to not be keeping proper records of the money which changes hands for this service. Would the Commission investigate this situation, and what plans does it have to ensure that the scheme is made affordable for pet owners?
