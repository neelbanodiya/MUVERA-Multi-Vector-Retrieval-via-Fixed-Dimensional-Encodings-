WRITTEN QUESTION E-4096/08 by Fiona Hall (ALDE) to the Commission (18 July 2008) Subject: Treatment of Ahmadiyya Muslims in Pakistan On 4th June 2008, 23 medical students were expelled from the Punjab College in Pakistan. These students had not broken any college rules or been involved in any misconduct. The only reason for their expulsion was that they are members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community. This decision was taken less than a month after tee National Assembly of Pakistan re-affirmed its commitment to safeguarding the interests and rights of all minority groups to the United Nations Human Rights Council. Is the Commission aware of this issue and will it now raise the treatment of Ahmadiyya Muslims with the Pakistan authorities?
