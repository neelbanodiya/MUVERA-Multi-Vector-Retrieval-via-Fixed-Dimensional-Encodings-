WRITTEN QUESTION P-3422/07 by Jan Březina (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 June 2007) Subject: Statements addressed by the Commission President José Manuel Barroso to the new Member States in connection with the EU summit At a press briefing held on Tuesday, 19 June 2007 the Commission President José Manuel Barroso directed some rather harsh words at the new Member States. He threatened Poland by saying that if no agreement concerning the new EU treaty could be reached, support and funding from the EU budget might be cut. The new Member States were then warned not to adopt a stance at the summit which might make the EU's life more difficult. In connection with the statements made by Mr Barroso, I should like the Commission to answer the following questions. 1. Which provision of primary or secondary EC law served as the basis for the threat to reduce support and funding from the EU budget on account of a Member State's political stance at the EU summit? 2. Does the Commission not consider the statements made to be contrary to the principle of the Member States' sovereignty? Do they not weaken the principle of loyal cooperation upon which the EU is based? 3. Does the Commission not consider that in making the above statements the Commission President exceeded his powers and interfered in matters which are the responsibility of the Member States?
