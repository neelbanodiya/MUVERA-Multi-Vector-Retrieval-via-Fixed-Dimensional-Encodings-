Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (8 December 2009) According to Directive 96/26/EC Directive 96/26/EC on the admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator, OJ L124, 23.5.1996. road hauliers must demonstrate every five years that they have capital and reserves at their disposal of at least EUR 9 000 when one vehicle is used and EUR 5 000 for each additional vehicle used. This financial capacity, which can be shown by means of a variety of assets, is the minimum required to properly maintain a fleet of lorries or coaches and safeguard road safety and fair competition. When adopting Regulation (EC) 1071/2009 Regulation (EC) 1071/2009, OJ L 300, 14.11.2009. , which will replace the abovementioned Directive as from December 2011, the Parliament and the Council decided that the value of the Euro in the currencies of the Member States which do not participate in the third stage of the European Monetary Union should be fixed every year, instead of every five years as it is under the present Directive. This change is intended to make sure that hauliers established in a Member State which does not belong to the Eurozone are not negatively affected by exchange rate fluctuations.
