WRITTEN QUESTION P-5872/08 by Werner Langen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (28 October 2008) Subject: Funding for a ski slope on Bornholm The EU has provided EUR 100 000 in funding for the creation of a ski slope on Bornholm, an island in the Baltic Sea popular because of its mild climate. Although Bornholm is obviously not a natural skiing area and there is no guarantee that such an installation there will be viable, the competent Agriculture Ministry in Copenhagen supported the funding application. Can the Commission answer the following questions? 1. What type of funding is being provided in this case? 2. What are the criteria for eligibility and who verifies that the information supplied is correct and that the investment to be funded is viable? 3. What was the justification given for establishing a ski slope on Bornholm? 4. Can the subsidy of EUR 100 000 from EU funds be reclaimed from Denmark since it is clear that the eligibility criteria were not verified thoroughly enough and this has resulted in EU funds being wasted? (The Danish Agriculture Ministry has already conceded this).
