Financial Perspective that expires at the end of next year 2006 and will be the second full year of budgetary expenditure of EU 25. To meet the needs of an enlarged Europe facing the challenges of the re-launched Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives, the Commission proposes an overall increase in the budgetary provisions for 2006 of 6%, amounting to 1.02% of the Union's GNI. It should be recalled that under the current Financial Perspective the ceiling for commitment appropriations Commitment appropriations cover the total cost of legal commitments entered into during a given financial year and/or previous financial years. is EUR 123.5 billion or 1.12% of GNI and that for payment appropriations it is EUR 119.1 billion or 1.08% GNI. The proposed 2006 budget, based as it is on a realistic estimates of needs, amounts to approximately 1.02% of GNI in payment appropriations and is therefore well within the imposed ceiling. The priorities of the Union are clearly established and condition the 2006 budget accordingly. Thus, in order to achieve the aims of the Lisbon Strategy, the accent is on strengthening efforts in Research, Education and Training, Mobility, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) the TENs and Regional Policy. Of course Regional Policy itself is central to the achievement of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives for it is within the regions that actions to promote education, job and gender equality, and assistance to SMEs are effectively put into practice. Ø Regional Development fund In 2006 payment appropriations rise by 9.2% to meet outstanding commitments made earlier during the programming period 2000 - 2006. see IP/05 27 April 2005 This reflects an expectation that payment needs for EU 15 in 2006 will be higher than in 2005. As can be expected, Regional Policy resources are heavily concentrated on the least prosperous regions, where growth potential is highest but public funds may be lacking. Appropriations for these regions are in accordance with the Copenhagen Agreement and the increase in 2006 is 8.6%. The overall increase in the Structural Funds budget is 3% compared with 2005. About 66% of the increase is accounted for by new structural commitments arising as payments are phased in for the 10 Member States that joined the Union in 2004. For EU 15, payment appropriations correspond to 95% of average year's commitments for objectives 1 and 2 and 90% for Community initiatives. These rates are the same as those
