ORAL QUESTION H-0867/06 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Commission Subject: Hazardous toxic waste Eight persons died and some 77 000 inhabitants of Abidjan, the capital of Côte d'Ivoire, were poisoned by the 528 000 litres of toxic and hazardous chemical waste (slops) dumped in 17 waste tips of the city by the tanker 'Probo Koala'; this vessel was flying the Panamanian flag, belonged to the 'Prime Marine Corporation' and was chartered by the Dutch company 'Trafigura Beheer'. It had unloaded the hazardous chemical waste in Abidjan at a cost twenty times below the rate in Amsterdam; this shows that a policy whose sole criterion is to increase capital profits is extremely dangerous for the life of workers and the environment. Does the Commission intend to take initiatives to punish all the guilty parties, support the victims and compensate for losses? What measures does it intend to take to protect the health of workers and the environment, and also to ensure the transport, processing and storage of the hazardous chemical waste?
