WRITTEN QUESTION E-5290/09 by Kathleen Van Brempt (S&D) to the Commission (26 October 2009) Subject: Safety issues regarding decisions to extend the lifetime of nuclear plant Would it not be true to say that decisions by Member States to extend the lifetime of plant in response to budget problems are in danger of undermining the independence of bodies responsible for safety oversight? What is the situation if operators pay for lifetime extensions under an agreement with the authorities, while at the same time those extensions are limited in accordance with the relevant safety provisions? How independent can a supervisory body remain if its recommendations threaten to run counter to the budgetary interests of the authority to which it belongs? Does the Commission consider that in such circumstances, the independence of supervisory and/or safety monitoring bodies are in danger of being compromised? Is the Commission planning benchmarking arrangements for national nuclear safety bodies? What factors does the Commission consider important in calculating plant lifetime: neutron radiation, corrosion, strength of external walls, wiring, training of staff, research, etc.? How many reactors have been operating commercially for 50 or 60 years and which are they? What has been the average life of decommissioned reactors in the EU?
