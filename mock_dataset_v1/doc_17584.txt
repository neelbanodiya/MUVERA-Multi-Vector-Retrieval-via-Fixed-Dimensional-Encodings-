work-related social security questions), furthering the EURES advisor network in terms of both quality and quantity, as this measure reaches out to the citizens of Europe; extending the job vacancies services not only to public employment agencies but also to private ones, through certification of non-formal qualifications and through operational links with the relevant activities in the Commission's DGs for Education and Culture, and for Justice, Freedom and Security; 8. Points out that the development of a single European labour market remains a clear objective and thus deplores the fact that the commitment credits requested in the preliminary draft budget for EURES are conservative and represent a decrease in relation to the amounts requested and obtained by the Parliament last year; considers that, taking into account the additional activities connected with the European Year of Workers' Mobility, funding cannot remain static and therefore suggests a significant increase in the budget allocation for EURES; 9. Stresses that LEONARDO and EUROPASS are important instruments for achieving the Lisbon goals and proposes that their allocations in the preliminary draft budget be significantly increased; 10. Acknowledges that the preliminary draft budget proposes an increase for the social dialogue budget lines in line with the position taken by Parliament last year and is looking forward to the evaluation report on these financial instruments that will be published in 2005; 11. Deplores the fact that the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work is the only agency within the remit of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs with no budget increase at all; no inflationary adjustment is proposed nor is there any extra financial allocation for the planned Risk Observatory, despite the fact that the plans to establish the Risk Observatory were adopted by the Agency's Administrative Board as part of its work programme and supported by the Commission.
