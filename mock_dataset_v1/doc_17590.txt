Renate Sommer Substitutes under Rule 178(2) present for the final vote 14.9.2005 OPINION of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for the Committee on Budgets on the draft general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2006 ( C6-0299/2005 - 2005/2001(BUD) ) Section III - Commission Draftsman: Umberto Guidoni SHORT JUSTIFICATION General comments The Provisional Draft Budget (PDB) for 2006, adopted on 27 April is the first budget proposal from the new Commission: · commitments amount to € 121,3 billion (representing 1.09% of EU GNI, an increase of 4% compared to 2005), · payments amount to €112,6 billion (1, 02% of EU GNI, an increase of 6% compared to 2005). The PDB for 2006 is the last budget under the present Financial Perspectives that expire at the end of that year. Since the 2006 budget is a transitional one, the proposal has got two objectives: · to guarantee financing for political and economic actions within the present Financial Perspectives for 2000-2006, · to prepare and develop the priorities defined in the strategic objectives for the next 7 years (2007-2013): prosperity, solidarity, security, enlargement and an enhanced role for the Union. Reinvigorating the Lisbon strategy in order to foster economic growth and employment Financing of the Lisbon strategy foresees some € 40 billion [Commitments € 39,138 billion (+7.1%), Payments € 33,417 billion (+8.9%)]. As the European Parliament stated it it's resolution of 6 July 2005, 'the Commission's PDB insufficiently reflects in budgetary terms the agreed political ambitions, especially as concerns the Lisbon strategy and taking into account the importance of strengthening the position of small an medium-sized enterprises' . The European Council, the Council and the Commission have constantly declared that the Lisbon strategy for employment and growth is their top priority. It is therefore unacceptable that both the Commission and the Council now propose to cut the relevant budget lines for 2006. In its resolution of 6 July 2005 Parliament also proposed to use the provisions of point 33 (concerning multiannual programmes) of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999. This seems justified given the great success of the existing multiannual programmes which function well, have a remarkable impact and meet high demand from stakeholders. However, the budget allocated for the Lisbon strategy is too focused on traditional policies like Rural Development and Structural Actions while we need to pay more attention to research and innovation.
