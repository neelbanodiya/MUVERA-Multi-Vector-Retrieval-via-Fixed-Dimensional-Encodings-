Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (25 February 2009) 1 and 2. The Commission does not see any contradiction between the Cosmetics Directive Directive 76/768/EEC, OJ L 262, 27.9.1976. and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 OJ L 396, 30.12.2006. of Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC. At the time when Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2003/15/EC OJ L 66, 11.3.2003. amending the Cosmetics Directive, the chemical legislation already provided that some testing had to be performed, including on animals, where alternatives did not exist. The REACH Regulation did not alter this situation, but expressly provides that animal testing should be avoided so that it is carried out only as a last resort and to that end identifies some ways of how this can be achieved (e.g. data sharing, incentive for the use of alternative methods to animal testing, public consultation and evaluation of animal testing proposals). Recital 13 provides that ‘this regulation should apply without prejudice to the prohibitions and restrictions laid down in Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products in so far as substances are used and marketed as cosmetic ingredients and are within the scope of this regulation. A phase-out of testing on vertebrate animals for the purpose of protecting human health as specified in Directive 76/768/EEC should take place with regard to the uses of those substances in cosmetics’. 3. In order to promote the development and availability of alternative test methods, the European Partnership for Alternative Approaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) was created. It is a joint initiative from the Commission and a number of companies and trade federations active in various industrial sectors. The Partnership’s work focuses on mapping existing research, developing new alternative approaches and strategies, and promoting communication, education, validation and acceptance of alternative approaches with the aim to refine, reduce and wherever possible to replace animal testing by suitable other methods that provide the same or a higher level of confidence. This initiative accommodates the finding of relevant alternative methods in several sectors, using cross
