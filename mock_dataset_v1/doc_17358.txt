the decision-making process as regards space, energy and research policy, bringing a more prominent role of the Union in the constructing of a secure and sustainable environment; 7. Considers that intensified contacts between the European Parliament and national parliaments should contribute to that debate; considers that in order to step up national debate on the economic and social development of Europe, means should be found of placing the Lisbon Strategy on national parliamentary agendas; 8. Considers that, in order to encourage maximum public participation in the democratic process, joint meetings should be organised as frequently as possible between the relevant European and national parliamentary committees and the representatives of the European political groups and national political parties; recommends also that national parliamentary experts be made familiar with the European instruments and their use; 9. Considers that the reflection period should be used not only to explain to citizens the chances that the Constitution could bring, but also to explain that the effectiveness of the Union is dependent on close and efficient cooperation between the Union and the Member States in decision making and implementation; 10. Supports the view that the introduction of European Excellence Awards for Young People and the support for those already in existence will give a major boost to research, innovation and energy and industrial policy where Europe is, or aspires to be, in the vanguard.
