2004/C 78 E/307 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3639/03 by Michl Ebner (PPE-DE) to the Commission (9 December 2003) Subject: Pollution in Wipp and Eisack valleys (Austria and Italy) Fine dust particles are known to be especially damaging to human health and to the natural environment. A representative example of a now widespread phenomenon is that motorway traffic in North and South Tyrol accounts for half the level of particle emissions for the entire region. The Brenner motorway, a major north-south axis, cuts a wide gash through the narrow Wipp and Eisack valleys. It is responsible for 30 % of hazardous emissions, and by releasing 13 000 tonnes of combustion residues annually, places these valleys under enormous strain. The frequent and sustained temperature inversions and persistent periods of low wind velocity that result from the geological structure of the Alpine valleys tend to impede or even prevent the dispersal and dilution of such particles. The serious impact on human beings and the natural environment of pollution from noise and hazardous particles generated by the enormous traffic volumes cannot be underestimated. The Commission is asked: — Is it proposed that more stringent standards will be introduced for motor-vehicles and their exhaust emissions, and if so in what form? — What measures are being taken to improve vehicle performance in the road-haulage industry?
