ORAL QUESTION H-0241/09 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2009 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Alojz Peterle to the Commission Subject: Stem cells Directive 2004/23/EC of 31 March 2004 sets standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells. The Directive is considered to be the basic framework for the procurement of cells and tissue in the European Union. The transposition of the Directive into national legislation has been seriously delayed by some Member States. As a result, certain activities related to cells and tissues are less developed in some Member States. Moreover, patients and medical practitioners are often also unaware of recent medical developments in, and the advantages of, stem cells. Has the Commission received an up-to-date report from all Member States before 7 April 2009 on the transposition of the different provisions of the Directive, as stipulated under Article 26 of the Directive? In view of the European Patients’ Rights Day on 18 April, is the Commission also considering stepping up its efforts to inform patients and medical practitioners about the advantages of stem cells?
