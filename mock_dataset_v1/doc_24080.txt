to ensuring a smooth transition from the phase of immediate relief and rehabilitation to a more medium-term response in the reconstruction phase. The Commission has earmarked a further EUR 200 million for that purpose. There is very close coordination within the EU on assistance to Haiti, and the Commission's efforts will be embedded in the global efforts. Regarding the write-off of Haiti's debt, the Commission supports the principle of debt cancellation as an important element of a comprehensive and non-conditional approach to development aid and is a partner in the initiative to support Highly Indebted poor Countries (HIPC) where European Development Fund loans are written off as part of the EU contribution to debt relief. In the case of Haiti the EU institutions do not have any outstanding loans vis-à-vis the country. Therefore, no debt relief could be provided to the country under the HIPC initiative. The Commission will continue to share these views on debt cancellation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and EU Member States as well as other donors and partners.
