framework); An ongoing lack of harmonisation 26. Points out that the compatibility of the Union’s customs system with WTO rules was essentially confirmed on appeal by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body in the aforementioned Case WT/DS315, and welcomes this result; 27. Notes, nevertheless, that both our trading partners and European economic operators themselves continue to call for greater harmonisation between national administrations in the implementation of Community customs legislation; 28. Notes that pernicious discrepancies are sometimes found between Member States, for example with regard to the levying of VAT on imports, conditions for access to certain simplified procedures, the frequency of physical checks on goods and penalties; 29. Considers that every effort must be made to ensure equal treatment for economic operators throughout the Community customs territory, as it is an essential prerequisite as regards preserving the integrity of the internal market and protecting the Union's financial interests, maintaining its powers in the area of external policy – particularly trade policy – and ensuring compliance with its international commitments; 30. Expresses its support for all measures seeking to increase cohesion between national administrations, encourage synergies, establish new communication and information-sharing systems, develop best practices and exchange staff and experiences with a view to enabling these administrations to function as one in the application of Community legislation; 31. Stresses the crucial importance, in this respect, of instruments such as the Community's integrated tariff (Taric), European binding tariff information (EBTI) and the common risk management framework; calls on the Commission and the Member States to continue to perfect these instruments and ensure they function properly; 32. Stresses the need to standardise the law of evidence or establish common minimum rules and ensure uniform implementation by the 27 Member States of Community customs regulations (and in particular Regulation (EC) 1383/2003); 33. Calls on the Commission to incorporate in its proposals precise rules on the administrative and penal sanctions for infringing the customs provisions laid down in Articles 27(a) and 280 of the EC Treaty as they would be amended by the Lisbon Treaty; 34. Criticises the reluctance of the Commission and the Member States to envisage, at this stage, new structures to ensure that Community customs legislation is applied in a uniform manner; calls on the Commission and the Member States to seriously consider the possibility of establishing a unified European Union customs service to enable customs rules and procedures to be implemented
