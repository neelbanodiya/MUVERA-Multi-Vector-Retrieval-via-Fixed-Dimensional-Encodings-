WRITTEN QUESTION P-3584/06 by Christa Prets (PSE) to the Commission (25 July 2006) Subject: Ruling by a court in The Hague rejecting a ban on a party, the PNVD, with a paedophile agenda In The Hague, Netherlands on 17 July 2006 judge HFM Hofhuis rejected a request to ban the PNVD (Brotherly Love, Freedom and Diversity) party, on the grounds that freedom of political association is a basic principle of democracy. The PNVD, which was set up in May, is initially advocating lowering the legal age of sexual consent from 16 to 12. The party's long-term goal is apparently to abolish the age limit on sex involving minors and to legalise possession of child pornography. Is the Commission intending in the near future to condemn this criminal agenda on the part of a political party? The rights of the child are an absolute priority in the European Union. In the light of this ruling, what steps does the Commission intend to take with a view to ensuring that in future the rights and protection of children are put above freedom of political association? What steps does the Commission envisage taking in order in future to prevent or penalise action (including court rulings) that is contrary to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)? What concrete measures does the Commission intend to take within the context of an EU strategy on the rights of the child (COM(2006)367 final, Commission communication of 4 July 2006) in order to combat child pornography and paedophile activity?
