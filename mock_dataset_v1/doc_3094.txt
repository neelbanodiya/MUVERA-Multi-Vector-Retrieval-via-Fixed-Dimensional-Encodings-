delay on the part of the Council in adopting the Commission proposals on a common asylum policy (17). The Parliament notes, however, that the Council is moving towards the adoption of Community legislation defining common rules on matters relating to asylum, and that consequently the codecision procedure and qualified majority voting should soon come into force in the field of asylum (19) (the Nice Treaty provides for the codecision on measures related to asylum to come into force once the Council has unanimously adopted the Community legislation defining the common rules and essential principles). Return and readmission Parliament recalls that the fight against illegal immigration, trafficking networks and all related crime must remain a priority for the EU (20). It stresses that Parliament should be consulted on readmission agreements (21) and that the overriding priority must be voluntary returns (22). External border control Parliament calls on the Council to consider the idea of creating a Community-financed European Border Guard Corps, which would, in an emergency and at the request of the Member States, be deployed to assist national authorities temporarily at vulnerable sections of the EU’s external borders (24). Institutional questions Parliament deplores the lack of democratic control over the measures adopted in the field on asylum and immigration, arising from the fact that the European Parliament is still only consulted, often within a time limit of three months, and is all too rarely informed of substantive changes within the Council’s negotiating process (26).
