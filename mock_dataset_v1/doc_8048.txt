ORAL QUESTION H-0130/04 for Question Time at the part-session in March I 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Niall Andrews to the Commission Subject: Commission reforms and EU citizens The Commission adopted the latest in its series of Reform Progress Reports on 9 February 2004. It includes commitments to the introduction of further reinforcing measures for dealing with irregular practices in EUROSTAT, incorporating new proposals for OLAF, the Anti-Fraud Office, and setting out guidelines for ‘whistleblowing’. Does the Commission consider that its reforms will have a genuinely positive impact on the citizens of Europe, and will it indicate what its current thinking is on the creation of new Commission responsibilities following enlargement? Will it support the appointment of individual Commissioners for issues relating to children, urban policy, the arts, sports, and social inclusion?
