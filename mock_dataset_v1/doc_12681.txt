consultation was the initial step in the revision of the current legislation on labelling and on nutrition labelling of foods. The Commission intends to put forward proposals that will ensure the provision of information about the nutrient content of foods that are relevant to health so that consumers are enabled to make informed choices suitable for their individual needs. The Commission considers this of the utmost importance. The Commission believes that dietary habits depend on many different factors and influencing them is a very complex exercise that requires a variety of actions. These should be proportionate and take into account the respective competence and responsibilities of the CE and its Member States. In that framework the Commission is both encouraging the adoption of self-regulatory measures and considering regulatory ones. The extent of the latter would be certainly influenced by the extent, pertinence and success of the former.
