Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (20 March 2009) Community rules prohibiting the carriage of liquids, aerosols and gels were initially adopted as Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 Commission Regulation (EC) No 1546/2006 of 4 October 2006 amending Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common basic standards on aviation security, OJ L 286 of 17.10.2006 as replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 820/2008, OJ L 221, 19.8.2008 . in October 2006. The regulation addressed the new threat to civil aviation that is posed by home-made liquid explosives. It prohibits passengers on flights departing from Community airports from taking liquids, aerosols and gels in hand luggage in individual quantities greater than 100 ml. Community requirements apply only to flights and passengers at Community airports. Third countries requirements do not necessarily mirror EC requirements. Third countries may deem that it is permissible for a member of the public to bring liquids, aerosols and gels aboard an aircraft. However, should that passenger transfer aircraft at a Community airport then the passenger will be subject to EU security controls, which apply to the connecting flight. In such a circumstance all liquids, aerosols and gels above 100 ml will be confiscated. As regards the responsibility to inform the passenger of the rules the legislation does clearly state that ‘The list of prohibited articles … and information about the exemptions permitted shall be made available to the public’. It is for each Member State to decide how best this obligation shall be met. However, such an obligation is only legally binding within the European Union and cannot be enforced in third countries. It is nonetheless to be hoped that airport shops in third countries do treat their customers in a fair and honest manner by making a reasonable effort to inform passengers flying via Community airports of the rules and restrictions relating to the carriage of liquids, aerosols and gels. In order to avoid confiscation of items when passengers transfer at Community airports, an exemption was envisaged for liquids, aerosols and gels sold at airport shops and on-board aircraft when certain security conditions are met by the third country, including the ‘tamper evident’ bag system. The Commission developed, in Commission Regulation (EC) No 915/2007 Commission Regulation (EC) No 915/2007 of 31 July 2007 amending Regulation (EC) No 622/2003 laying down measures for the implementation of the common
