non-state actors in EC development policy ( COM(2002) 598 - 2002/2283(INI)) Doc.: A5-0249/2003 Procedure : Own-initiative report Debate : 03.09.2003 Vote: 04.09.2003 The House adopted own- initiative resolution with 284 votes in favour, 8 against and 9 abstentions recognising the essential role of non-state actors (NSA) in carrying out the process of political democratisation, building an active civil society and strengthening economic and social cohesion. However, MEPs stress that the involvement of NSA in EU development policy should be based on EU guidelines and priorities given to its political responsibility. The resolution comes in response to the Commission Communication on participation of non-state actors in EC development policy. The House calls for the setting up of multi-stakeholder national or regional co-operation programme steering committees in each developing State or region. These would consult on EU aid programmes and promote all aspects of civil society participation including representatives of the ACP State concerned, the Head of the European Commission Delegation in the country, and representatives of the local NSAs. As regards funding of Non State Actors, the resolution welcomes and fully endorses the Commission’s Programming Guidelines in particular regarding the figure of up to 15% of European Development Fund funds to be allocated to local Non State Actors. €1.4bn of Europe’s official development assistance is claimed to be managed by or with such non-state actors (NSAs), but the European Commission’s own figures show that this represents just 3% of assistance to Latin America and just 2% to Asia.
