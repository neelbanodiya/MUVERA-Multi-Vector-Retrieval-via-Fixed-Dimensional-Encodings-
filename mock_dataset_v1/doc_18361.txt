Arab world and the frozen conflicts in the common neighbourhood require common responses and a better cooperation in crisis management; 3. Looks forward to the initiative to issue a joint progress report on the Partnership for Modernisation aiming to identify specific projects to make the partnership a functional reality in its key areas; takes the view, however, that the concept of modernisation cannot be limited to economic cooperation and technological innovation but must go along with an ambitious process of domestic reforms that include the consolidation of democratic institutions and of a reliable legal system, the respect of the rule of law and the unhindered development of a genuine civil society; calls, in this regard, on the Commission and the Russian Government to define the necessary steps to be taken in order to achieve these goals; 4. Stresses that currently the relations with Russia can only be of a pragmatic nature, with maintained focus on concluding the new EU-Russia agreement in due time, and by concentrating on practical cooperation, joint projects and implementation of commitments and agreements made so far; notes the slow progress in the rounds of talks on the new EU-Russia Agreement and calls on the parties to have an approach based on genuinely shared common values and interests; 5. Takes note of the bilateral deal finalised in December 2010 enabling Russia’s accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO); calls on the Russian authorities to adopt a stable and fair legal framework to properly regulate the business activity, foreign direct investments and competition policy; considers of the utmost importance the consolidation of a reliable judicial system and an effective fight against corruption at all levels; 6. Regrets that the announced roadmap for visa-free travel between Russia and the EU will not be presented as planned at the upcoming EU-Russia Summit, while the roadmap document was completed in early May 2011, but needs to be approved by all the 27 Member States; reiterates the commitment for the long-term objective of visa free travel between the EU and Russia, based on a step-by-step approach focused on substance and practical progress; points out, nevertheless, that visa facilitation and visa liberalisation with the Russian Federation should in no way privilege the holders of Russian passports living in the frozen conflicts regions at the expense of citizens of Moldova and Georgia; welcomes the decision taken in the framework of the EU-Russia Parliamentary Cooperation
