Answer given by Ms Georgieva on behalf of the Commission (16 January 2012) The Commission carried out two humanitarian needs assessment missions on 12 and 17 October 2011. As a consequence of the assessments, the Commission adopted on 10 November 2011 a EUR 4 million emergency decision with the objective of improving the humanitarian situation of people affected by floods and related disasters in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. The main sectors of intervention identified are health, water and sanitation, food assistance, non-food items, short-term livelihood support, small-scale rehabilitation works and disaster risk reduction. This EU humanitarian assistance will complement the national response efforts and it is targeting the most isolated, neglected or under-served communities, as well as the poorest and most vulnerable population groups affected by the disaster. In addition, the authorities of El Salvador requested and accepted assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (offered by Austria). An EU Civil Protection expert team was deployed to San Salvador to report on the evolution on site, to liaise with national authorities and to facilitate the coordination of the incoming European civil protection assistance. The current financial allocations for the non-reimbursable development cooperation with Central America cover the period 2007-2013. During 2010, the mid‑term review exercise of the regional strategy, the financial allocation for cooperation with the Central American region was increased by EUR 20 million. No further increase is foreseen before the adoption of the new programming and financial framework covering the period 2014-2020.
