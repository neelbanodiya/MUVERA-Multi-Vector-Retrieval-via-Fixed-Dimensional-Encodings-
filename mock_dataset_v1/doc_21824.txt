Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (20 May 2005) 1. The Commission shares the Honourable Member’s point of view that the protection of national languages and cultures is an important aspect of Europe’s rich and diverse cultural heritage. Indeed, the Commission is committed to the principle of providing a multilingual, European education to the children of EU staff in all locations where there are EU institutions. However, the issue of the mechanisms for ensuring delivery of education in the European School system needs to be addressed separately. In this particular context, decisions on the opening, maintenance and closure of individual language sections are governed by the so-called ‘Gaignage’ report criteria, which were adopted by the Board of Governors of the European Schools in October 2000 ‘Criteria for the setting-up, closure or maintenance of the European Schools’, document approved by the Board of Governors at its meeting of 24 and 25 October 2000, 2000-D-7510, 27 October 2000. . 2. The Commission believes that the European Schools have for the past 50 years provided a high-quality, multilingual and multicultural education to the children of the staff of the EU institutions. In particular, as the Commission stated in its consultation document Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Consultation on options for the developing the European Schools System, COM(2004)519 final. issued in July 2004, ‘the availability of the Schools has made it easier for the institutions to recruit experienced, highly qualified staff’. In this context, the Commission remains committed to the European School system and can therefore agree with the Honourable Member that the schools very much retain their original raison d’être, as set out in Article I of the intergovernmental Convention OJ L 212, 17.8.1994. This Convention cancels and replaces the original Statute of 12 April 1957 and the Protocol thereto of 13 April 1962. establishing their statutes. This article provides that ‘The purpose of the Schools is to educate together children of the staff of the European Communities. Besides the children covered by the Agreements provided for in Articles 28 and 29, other children may attend the Schools within the limits set by the Board of Governors’. A progressive increase in the level of fees (proposed by the Commission in light of Parliament’s Bösch report ‘Report of the Committee on Budgets: On the future financing of the European Schools’ (2002/2083(INI)), A5-0395/2002 final,13 November
