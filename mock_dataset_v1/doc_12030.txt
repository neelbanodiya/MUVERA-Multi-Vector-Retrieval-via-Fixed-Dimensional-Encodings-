WRITTEN QUESTION E-1163/06 by Philip Claeys (NI) to the Commission (23 March 2006) Subject: Murder of the parents of Kurdish militants in Turkey On 3 March in Turkey, Fatim and Ferho Akgül were murdered, and their bodies were foully mutilated. The couple had two sons: Derwish Ferho, chairman of the Kurdish Institute in Brussels, and Medenî Ferho, a journalist with the Kurdish broadcaster Roj TV. According to Derwish Ferho, the double murder was probably committed by Jitem, the intelligence service linked to the Turkish army. In the past the couple had repeatedly been threatened because of the political activities of their two sons. The latter now claim that the investigation into the murder is not being pursued seriously. In the light of the accession negotiations with Turkey, what is the Commission's position on this? Has it already contacted the Turkish authorities about the matter?
