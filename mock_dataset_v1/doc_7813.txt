this reflects Regulation (EC) No 2062/94 by which it was founded which strives to achieve a tripartite presence by including social partners in the Governing Board; notes that the practical, everyday business of the Agency is run by the 11-member Bureau, appointed by the Governing Board; Carryover appropriations 4. Is concerned that the Court of Auditors reported once again in 2009 carry forwards of EUR 3 500 000 (47 % of the commitments made) in respect of the operational activities (Title III) to the budgetary year 2010; stresses that this situation indicates delays in the implementation of the Agency's activities and is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality; recognises that this is caused partly because of the multiannuality of important projects; acknowledges, nevertheless, that the Agency, in early 2010, established a monthly reporting mechanism to monitor the implementation of the activities envisaged in its annual work programme and the corresponding budgetary aspects; 5.
