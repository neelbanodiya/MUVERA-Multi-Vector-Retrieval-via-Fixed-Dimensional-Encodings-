WRITTEN QUESTION E-3687/09 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (19 May 2009) Subject: Possible funding for the construction of a photovoltaic plant in the municipality of Cisterna Photovoltaic energy from the transformation of sunlight into electricity is a non-polluting, but unfortunately not yet widespread, resource, especially in Italy, where the transition towards its use would be strategic. The economic and environmental advantages which would derive from the use of this energy source are still limited by the high cost of the commercial technology, despite the fact that financial incentives exist, though these are not completely sufficient. In the municipality of Cisterna, province of Latina, a project has been submitted with a view to setting aside a piece of land for the construction of a photovoltaic plant. This plant, according to the company due to install it, will have a power output of 1 995.84 kWp. The aim is to release the energy produced into the electricity grid and sell it, the only constraint being a 20-year contract for the producer of the plant. Not only would this plant produce ‘clean’ electricity for the community, with savings on energy bills, but it would also contribute to national and EU pollution reduction targets. That said, can the Commission: 1. say whether there are any Community programmes or funding for the construction of this photovoltaic plant; 2. give a general overview of the situation?
