WRITTEN QUESTION E-2614/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (8 May 2008) Subject: Authorisation of genetically modified variety of potato Recently, a member of the Board of Directors of the German chemicals company, BASF, stated that the company will use all legal means against the Commission if it does not authorise the cultivation of a genetically modified variety of potato (Solanum tuberosum L. series EH92-527-1) for the production of starch with a higher amylopectin content, which is intended for industrial use and animal feed. In accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC OJ L 106, 17.4.2001, p. 1. , from 2009, it will not be permitted to market GMOs containing antibiotic-resistant genes which could be harmful to humans and the environment. What is the Commission's answer to the blackmailing and disdainful statements by BASF? In what way will it protect the environment, biodiversity and human health from the risks which may arise from the free cultivation of this genetically modified organism?
