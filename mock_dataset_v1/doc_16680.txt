Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (9 August 2006) 1. The Italian Competition Authority has recently acted against suppliers of jet fuel for having entered into an anti-competitive arrangement. The Commission is not aware of any similar anti-competitive arrangements within the Community. 2. Fighting cartels and other anti-competitive arrangements between competitors is a Commission priority. If the Commission becomes aware of such anti-competitive conduct at Community level, it would not fail to look into it. 3. The price of fuel constitutes a significant part of the operating costs of airlines. It can therefore be expected that price increases caused by anti-competitive agreements will be reflected in ticket prices.
