Question for written answer E-000885/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (10 February 2011) Subject: Dublin II and the judgment by the European Court of Human Rights The Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 8 and 9 November 2010 rejected the Commission proposal to include, in the revised Dublin II regulation a mechanism for suspending the transfer of asylum seekers in cases where a Member State’s asylum system is coming under exceptional pressure. The recent judgment by the European Court of Human Rights condemning Greece and Belgium, the decision by Germany to suspend the return of asylum seekers, the declaration of intent to adopt similar measures published a few days ago (24 January 2011) by the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland and Denmark and numerous appeals by NGOs for suspension of the transfer of asylum seekers in Greece effectively show that there was no reason to reject the mechanism and that this decision is in practice being refuted even by those Member States which supported it. What action does the Council intend to take in the light of these developments? How does the Hungarian Presidency intend to approach the matter? Are the Member Statures willing to amend the regulation along pragmatic lines, given that to-date it has failed to function adequately and sustainably?
