WRITTEN QUESTION E-0285/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Council (2 February 2005) Subject: Threat of military intervention in Iran Answering questions by Members of the European Parliament at a meeting of the Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs on 18 January 2005, Jean Asselborn, Foreign Minister of Luxembourg and President-in-Office of the Council, voiced his concern at recent statements by the US President about the possibility of a US military intervention in Iran. Mr Asselborn pointed out in particular that such an act was incompatible with the UN rules. Given public concern about a possible US invasion of Iran, how does the Council intend to demonstrate clearly that it is opposed to any military intervention in Iran?
