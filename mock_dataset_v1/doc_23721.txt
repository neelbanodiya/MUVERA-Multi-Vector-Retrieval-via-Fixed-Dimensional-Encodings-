Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2006) As in many EU Member States, it is the standard practice of the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and of Bulgaria to provide special treatment (‘VIP treatment’) to visiting foreign dignitaries and delegations, including to those from EU countries and institutions. This includes facilitation at borders and the provision of security throughout the stay in the country. It is in this context that the authorities provide a police escort for visiting delegations. The Commission understands road safety to be a matter of shared responsibility for all. The authorities of a State should act as an example to their citizens. In this respect, driving with excessive speed constitutes one of the major causes of fatal accidents. Ensuring compliance with the rules is one of the messages of the mid‑term review of the European road safety action programme. States aspiring to accession to the EU should, when entering the European Union, be guided by the same rules as the Member states. Road safety is included in the scope of the transport policy acquis on which candidate countries and potential candidate countries will have to align themselves in the course of their preparation for accession.
