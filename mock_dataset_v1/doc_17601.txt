to put appropriations on this line. Research on Transport Although not directly within the remit of the Transport and Tourism Committee your draftsman notes with concern the substantial reduction proposed in financial support for research on transport. The reduction is of the order of 7.5% Draftsman's proposals and amendments The Preliminary Draft Budget as it effects transport and tourism has welcome and less welcome aspects. Reinforced funding for passengers' rights, maritime environmental protection and transport safety are particularly welcome. However funding levels proposed for some other areas appear to be inadequate. In view of the foregoing your draftsman would propose reinforcing TEN-T expenditure, both commitments and payments, by an additional 120 € million above the amount proposed in the PDB. He would also propose restoring commitment appropriations for sustainable surface transport to a figure approaching its 1995 level. Your draftsman in of opinion of necessity of increase by 19 € million amounts devoted to transport research in 2006. Finally he believes a modest sum of 0.1 € million in both commitment and payment appropriations should be included to support studies which will help formulate a coherent, pro-active EU policy on tourism. Naturally your draftsman reserves the right to propose further amendments in the light of the Draft Budget for 2006 when this is adopted by Council and specifically to seek to restore amounts to transport lines in that budget if they are subject to unreasoned reductions. There is a major difference between the European Aviation Safety Agency and the European Railway Agency for Safety and Interoperability in the proportions between subsidies under Titles 1 and 2 and subsidies under Title 3. The Aviation Agency plans to spend 12,28 € million and 9,72 € million, while the Railway Agency plans to spend 11,055 € million and 3,4 € million respectively. The ratios are approximately 4:3 for the Aviation Agency and 3:1 for the Railway Agency. The Commission should explain this.
