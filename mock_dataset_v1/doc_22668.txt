WRITTEN QUESTION E-3891/08 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (11 July 2008) Subject: Postnatal depression It seems that specialist opinion differs as to the definition of ‘postnatal depression’. Some experts define it as a type of non-psychotic depression that occurs during the twelve months following delivery, most often during the first four to six weeks. But it is not clear what the distinction is between depression that begins during the post-partum period and depression that was already present during pregnancy (perinatal depression) or whether postnatal depression can be regarded as a separate diagnosis at all. Others prefer to speak in terms of bipolar or schizophrenic disorders rather than using the expressions ‘puerperal psychosis’ or ‘post-partum depression’, given the lack of evidence for classifying these as separate diagnostic entities. And yet such depression is a very real condition, for which the women affected do not always receive appropriate treatment, because the condition is often not recognised as a disease. — Can the Commission provide information on the incidence of the condition in the EU Member States? — Is the Commission in a position to indicate the risk factors for postnatal depression? — Does it have sufficiently convincing evidence to be able to regard the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale as a valid screening instrument for identifying women at risk for postnatal depression? — Are there prevention protocols for the condition? — What initiatives does the Commission intend to take to help combat this particular form of depression and define it precisely?
