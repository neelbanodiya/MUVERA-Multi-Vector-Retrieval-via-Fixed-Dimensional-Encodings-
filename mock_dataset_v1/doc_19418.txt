Question for written answer E-4989/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Konrad Szymański (ECR) (2 July 2010) Subject: The consequences of Cultural Cooperation Protocols concluded with third countries as part of trade liberalisation agreements As the Unesco Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions of 2005 stipulates, audiovisual productions should not be a subject of negotiations on trade liberalisation and trade agreements. Cultural Cooperation Protocols concluded between the European Union and third countries are attached to bilateral agreements on trade liberalisation. They grant the status of European works to third‑country co‑productions on the basis of criteria that are less rigorous than those in force within the EU (as set out in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive 2007/65/EC OJ L 332, 18.12.2007, p. 27. ). With a view to ensuring compliance with the aforementioned Unesco convention, how does the Commission intend to make sure that audiovisual products are not treated solely as commodities and are not a direct subject of trade agreements and trade liberalisation? How will the Commission guarantee that the rules set out in Cultural Cooperation Protocols do not have an adverse impact on the European audiovisual market by lowering demand for films produced in the EU?
