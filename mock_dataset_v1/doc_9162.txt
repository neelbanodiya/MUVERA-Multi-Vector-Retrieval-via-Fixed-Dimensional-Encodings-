WRITTEN QUESTION E-2317/06 by David Hammerstein Mintz (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (29 May 2006) Subject: Cable and tyre dump in Léon Recuperación de Materiales Diversos (RMD S.A.) is a company which owns plants in Ardoncino, carretera de León-La Bañeza, Km. 7.5, which, inter alia , processes electrical cables. The sheathing (PVC, polyeurothane, etc.) left as waste once the metal has been removed is ground up in the work shop; it contains remains of metals like copper. This waste is dumped in ‘La Laguna’, in the Santovenia de la Valdoncina district. On 26 March 2004, the Leonese Administrative Disputes Courts No 1, in Case (Procedimiento Ordinario) 390/01, ruled that the authorisation of Santovenia de la Valdoncina town council concerning temporary stockage of this waste was null and void; the fourth legal justification of the ruling classed it as dangerous waste. Santovenia de la Valdoncina town council, in order to meet the ruling, issued a decree on 19 May 2005 totally suspending the processes concerned, with immediate effect. RMD S.A. has not removed the waste dump, and is opening up a six-metre by six-metres pit into which this dangerous waste is being thrown and covered with earth, instead of removing them so they can be treated by an authorised waste-management specialist. The result will be the irreversible contamination of the soil and sub-soil, with tons of this dangerous waste remaining permanently buried. Various fires have occurred in the area where the company is dumping the waste (in April 2005, the civil protection authorities had to declare a first-level emergency in the surrounding villages). The company has also seen various serious fires on its own premises, involving PVC cables stored in the open air, and in the processing sheds themselves. Is the Commission aware of this environmentally hostile dumping of dangerous waste? Does the Commission believe that Directives 96/61/EC OJ L 257, 10.10.1996, p. 26 . (IPPC), concerning integrated pollution prevention and control, 75/442/ECE OJ L 194, 25.7.1975, p. 39 . , on waste and 2000/76/EC OJ L 332, 28.12.2000, p. 91 . , on the incineration of waste are being infringed? Given the repeated fires that have broken out in the dump and those on the premises, what measures does the Commission intend to take with regards to guaranteeing safety? Is Directive 96/82/EC OJ L 10, 14.1.1997, p. 13 . on the control of major-accident hazards involving dangerous substances being complied with?
