WRITTEN QUESTION E-3568/08 by Katerina Batzeli (PSE) to the Council (24 June 2008) Subject: Climate change and consumer protection If the measures to address to climate change finally to be taken at Community and international level, including of course the greenhouse gas Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), are to be successful, steps must be taken as a matter of principle to safeguard the public interest, the role of the public utilities and information and protection for consumers/members of the general public. These three basic principles, in addition to economic stability, will rally active public support for environmental and climate protection measures. To this end, it is also necessary to avoid policies which impose an economic burden on consumers, particularly at a time when their incomes are being hit by high living costs caused principally by the increased price of oil, a pollutant. In order to avoid a conflict of interest between consumers and companies purchasing pollutant emission rights either directly or under transitional arrangements: — Are plans afoot to draw up a charter of the legal rights of consumers, to provide them with information and protection regarding climate policies, including emission rights trading by electricity generating companies? — Are measures being taken to ensure that the cost of emissions trading by companies, and in particular public utilities, will not be passed on to consumers but will be met under the operational and investment plans of the companies concerned and that these arrangements will be constantly monitored and scrutinised by the national regulatory authorities? — Is the progressive application of the emissions trading scheme across the board preferable as a means of bringing company operations into line, while at the same time developing renewable energy sources? — Should the redistribution of revenue from auctions at national and Community level not be used to encourage ‘green’ employment and protect the interests of vulnerable sections of society and of consumers in general?
