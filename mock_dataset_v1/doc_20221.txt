WRITTEN QUESTION E-1326/10 by Søren Bo Søndergaard (GUE/NGL) and Ole Christensen (S&D) to the Commission (8 March 2010) Subject: Work-related cancer In April 2008, for the first time, the Danish health authorities recognised a case of work-related cancer caused by working in the vicinity of emissions from running aircraft engines (loading work at Copenhagen airport). In that connection, will the Commission say what material/information it has available concerning the extent to which there is a link between working in the vicinity of burning aviation fuel and the incidence of cell mutations or excessive frequency of DNA-damaging particles in the body? If the Commission does not have such information immediately to hand, will it take initiatives to obtain such information in order to answer this question at a subsequent point?
