ORAL QUESTION H-0699/03 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Paulo Casaca to the Council Subject: Waiver of fines for exceeding the reference quantities for milk production The October 2003 Brussels European Council, according to paragraph 38 of its conclusions, approved the prolongation of the specific additional milk quota for the Azores, corresponding to the region's internal consumption of milk and dairy products as approved by the Nice European Council in 2000. This decision annulled those of the Agriculture Council which would have reduced the quota by 23 000 tonnes. There is, however, no mention in the same paragraph of those conclusions of a single extra litre of milk quota being allocated to the Azores (the region's share of the general and specific milk quotas remains unchanged in all respects). Still less is there any mention of any waiver - not so much as a euro's worth - of any fines. Nonetheless, the Portuguese government and press continue to repeat the opposite, claiming that there has been an increase in the permitted production level, as well as a fine waiver. The milk producers in the Azores have thus been astonished to discover that there will in fact be no waiver of fines already paid, and that they are not authorised to produce so much as one litre more than in the past. Will the Council approve a fine waiver for milk producers in the Azores, thus returning them the amounts they had to pay over the last production year? Will the Council increase the overall quantity available for milk production in the Azores, updating the estimates for internal consumption of milk and dairy products?
