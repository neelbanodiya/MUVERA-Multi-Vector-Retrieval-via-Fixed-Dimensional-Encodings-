Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (4 September 2006) The Commission has not yet received separate data from the Greek statistical authorities for VAT receipts in Greece for 2005, and therefore cannot confirm the veracity of the claim made by the Greek Centre for Economic Planning and Research. The data transmission of the breakdown of the Greek tax revenues would usually be expected later in the year. However, as a general remark, on the basis of the Commission's 2006 spring forecast and the excessive deficit procedure (EDP) notification of April 2006, total tax revenue from 2005 was relatively low. In addition, VAT revenues might have been lower than expected on the basis of past trends. However, as mentioned, official figures on VAT receipts for 2005 have not yet been communicated. Additionally, the update of the stability programme of Greece submitted in December 2005 emphasises the efforts of Greece to reverse the recent downward trend in revenue collection, and gradually returning to the much higher tax elasticity with respect to the gross domestic product (GDP) that prevailed in the past. To this end, the update and the 2006 budget law refers to a series of measures aiming at fighting against tax evasion and tax fraud, especially, but not only, in VAT and other indirect taxes. In this context, it is also worth noting that the Commission has adopted a communication the aim of which is to launch a debate with all parties concerned on a European strategy to combat tax fraud COM(2006)254 final. , in particular in the field of VAT. It notes that tax fraud is a growing problem and that the Member States cannot act effectively in isolation. It thus proposes among others strengthening the provisions in force for indirect taxation (VAT and excise duties) and reforming Community legislation on direct taxation and assistance in the recovery of taxes.
