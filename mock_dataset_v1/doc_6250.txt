Question for written answer E-4108/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (11 June 2010) Subject: Future prospects for the EU-Balkans relationship Organised crime wields power and is a fact of life today in Kosovo and Montenegro, its influence is felt in Serbia and Macedonia, and it is pushing its way into Croatia and threatening Bosnia. Croatia’s accession in a few years time, most probably in 2012 when it will become the 28th EU Member State, cannot and must not leave Serbia out in the cold. Moreover, Kosovo’s future needs to be settled and the situation in Macedonia stabilised before the pro-independence jostling in restless Montenegro can be resolved. The Balkan States, other than Croatia and maybe Serbia, will not be in a position to join the EU for some considerable time yet, as the slowing down in the reform process required by Brussels is linked to the current global crisis which has hit the region’s weak economies. Widespread corruption and the collusion between criminals and politicians has further weakened economies in the region, with the systematic corruption in south-east Europe now the major factor hindering development efforts in the region and distorting efforts to rebuild the economies of these countries. As regards opening up to the Balkans, what is the current situation with reference to corruption and what strategies does the Council plans to adopt?
