Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2012) The first full year of operation for the European Progress Microfinance Facility Decision 283/2010/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 March 2010 establishing a European Progress Microfinance Facility for employment and social inclusion, OJ L 87, 7.4.2010, p. 1. was 2011. Although it is therefore too early to draw conclusions regarding its performance, demand from the sector and the number of contracts signed with microcredit providers are encouraging. To date, 15 contracts have been signed with microcredit providers in 10 Member States Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Spain. Further information at www.ec.europa.eu/epmf , which is a satisfactory geographical distribution. Further contracts are expected to be signed in France, Italy and Slovenia in the coming months. On their own, the current 15 intermediaries have committed themselves by contract to generate nearly EUR 137 million in over 10 500 microloans to self-employed persons or micro-enterprises microloans in the coming years. As far as Greece is concerned, a guarantee agreement for EUR 803 250 and an agreement on a senior loan of EUR 8 750 000 were signed with the Pancretan Cooperative Bank in December 2011. These are expected to result in EUR 19 million in microloans for micro-enterprises, including start-ups. The Commission’s second annual report, due for presentation in June 2012, will cover the Facility’s implementation in greater depth.
