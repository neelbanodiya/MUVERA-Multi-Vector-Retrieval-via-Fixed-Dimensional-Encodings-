WRITTEN QUESTION P-0310/05 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Council (2 February 2005) Subject: Reception facilities for refugees on the EU's eastern border On 5 January 2005 Chechen refugees from the Vinin refugee camp near the Polish town of Kalvar reported their inhuman living conditions to the international community. The camp houses approximately 150 people, including a number of cancer patients. Three or even four families have to share one room. Meals are appalling by any standard, consisting of rotten food. Doctors come only occasionally and illnesses are treated with painkillers and no other medication. Healthcare is totally inadequate and the refugees have no money to pay for medical treatment themselves. There are no facilities for children and they do not go to school. 1. Is the Council aware of the situation described above and does it know of other similar conditions in refugee camps in Member States on the EU's eastern border? 2. Is the Council prepared to raise the matter with the Polish authorities responsible in order to put a stop to the inhuman conditions in which these refugees are living? 3. What measures does the Council intend to take to ensure decent conditions in reception facilities for refugees?
