Question for written answer E-005091/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (24 May 2011) Subject: Sustainable grassland management to protect our climate Cows are often seen as damaging to the climate because of their emission of methane. This has now been contradicted by noteworthy veterinary practitioners (such as the German vet Anita Idel in a new book), who maintain that it is not the cattle that cause environmental damage, but agricultural systems which aim to maximise production by feeding too much concentrated feed. Experts now point out that optimal cattle farming in the context of ecological and holistic agriculture can help to protect the climate. This would preserve more permanent pasture, so that large amounts of the harmful greenhouse gas carbon dioxide could be stored in the ground with no ill effects. Accordingly, in the run-up to the reform of the EU agriculture policy (CAP) for the new financial period from 2014, agricultural experts are calling for a change from maximising production to optimal production. 1. What is the Commission’s view of this holistic approach to a solution for sustainable animal welfare and soil protection for the CAP period after 2013? 2. Will these findings influence the run-up to the CAP reform, to enable climate protection objectives to be met? 3. Are there plans for EU directives after 2013 on limiting the amount of concentrates that can be fed to cattle? (Cf. the recommended guideline from the Austrian organic farmers’ federation Bio Austria, an organisation of Austrian organic farmers, which recommends limiting the amount of concentrated feed to a maximum of 15 % http://www.bio-austria.at/biobauern ).
