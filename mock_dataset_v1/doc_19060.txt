Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (12 November 2007) Racism and xenophobia are incompatible with the values that the European Union is founded upon. The Union, within the powers that the Treaties confer it to prevent and combat racism and xenophobia, has put in place numerous measures (legislation, awareness raising activities, financial programmes). The European Union has signed an agreement with Switzerland on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis. While this agreement, which has not yet been ratified, foresees Swiss association to the area of freedom, security and justice as regards the external border controls, police cooperation and cooperation in criminal matters, it does not include the actions for combating racism and xenophobia. The Commission regrets deeply whenever political parties launch campaigns that are likely to contribute to increasing racism or xenophobia, whether this occurs in a Member State or in a third country.
