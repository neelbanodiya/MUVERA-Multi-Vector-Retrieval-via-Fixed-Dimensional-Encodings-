WRITTEN QUESTION E-1739/05 by Kartika Liotard (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (18 May 2005) Subject: Reclassification of eggs and complaints by the Netherlands to the Commission about it 1. Is the Commission aware of the discovery by the Dutch foundation ‘Wakker Dier’ that traces on deep-litter eggs and semi-intensive eggs in various Dutch supermarkets indicate that they come from battery hens? 2. Is the Commission aware that the Netherlands Minister of Agriculture, Mr Veerman, when faced with questions about this issue from Ms Van Velzen, a Socialist Party Member of the Netherlands Parliament, replied that ‘it is easy to reclassify eggs’ because the European regulation on marketing standards does not require all eggs to be stamped on-farm, and that the Netherlands has already ‘drawn this problem to the attention of the Commission on several occasions’? 3. Can the Commission confirm that the Netherlands has repeatedly raised this issue? If so, why has the Commission not taken any measures against this form of deception of consumers? How soon will the Commission submit a proposal to guarantee accurate labelling? How will the Commission do this?
