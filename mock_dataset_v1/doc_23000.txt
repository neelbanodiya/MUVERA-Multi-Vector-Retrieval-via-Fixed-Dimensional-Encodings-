OPINION of the Committee on Culture and Education for the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on European broadband: investing in digitally driven growth ( 2010/2304(INI) ) Rapporteur: Malika Benarab-Attou SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Culture and Education calls on the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Notes that the Commission is aiming to combat the digital divide and provide broadband for all, since this is a service of vital importance for the development of geographically remote areas, including sparsely populated, island and mountain areas, and for the improvement of digital literacy and skills; 2. Calls on the Commission to urge the Member States, in pursuance of the objectives of the Digital Agenda and once widespread broadband coverage has been achieved in Europe, to provide rural areas too with adequate fast and ultra-fast networks; with this in mind, considers that the roll-out of FTTB and FTTH should be intensified so as to avoid the creation of uneconomic transitional solutions; 3. Recalls that the new technologies and access to high-speed connections impact positively on citizens’ education, information, communications and recreation; 4. Considers that it is essential to address the barriers that are keeping part of the population offline and to engage as many stakeholders as possible to provide: (1) training and public access to broadband services, (2) economic assistance for the acquisition of broadband services and equipment, and (3) incentives for the development of technology and content aimed at specific users’ needs; 5. Takes the view that, while the roll-out of digital infrastructure should initially be market-driven and technology-neutral, there may be a need to employ European, national and regional means of obtaining public financial support in order to guarantee standards in respect of quality, diversity of content and the democratisation of access to broadband, with special emphasis on areas in which commercial investment is unlikely to occur; 6. Notes, however, that the cost in administrative and planning terms of implementing EU subsidy programmes, particularly for SMEs and for local and regional authorities, is considerable, and that a legal uncertainty exists in practice which often inhibits planned investments; calls therefore on the Commission to examine to what extent the subsidy rules can be simplified and rendered more attractive to investors, and how better coordination can be achieved between European and national programmes; 7.
