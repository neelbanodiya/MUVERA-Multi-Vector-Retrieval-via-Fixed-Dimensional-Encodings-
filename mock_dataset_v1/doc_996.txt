WRITTEN QUESTION E-4005/05 by Michael Cashman (PSE) to the Commission (3 November 2005) Subject: Persons employed by the Commission in the field of non-discrimination How many people are employed by the Commission, either directly or indirectly, in the field of non-discrimination? How many units are there? Are all areas of non-discrimination as enumerated in Article 13 (TEC) covered? Where units cover more than one form of discrimination, please specify those employed by breaking down the units into subsections. Does the Commission agree that for reasons of transparency such information should be freely accessible to the public? Can the Commission explain and justify its reason for not providing such information to an NGO recently? If such data is not available will the Commission ensure that it is produced for the European Parliament?
