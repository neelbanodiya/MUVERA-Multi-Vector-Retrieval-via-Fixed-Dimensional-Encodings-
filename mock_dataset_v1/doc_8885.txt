for the implementation of LIFE+ shall be set at EUR 1 911 000 000 (in 2004 prices) for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. Justification The extra € 100 million agreed in the context of FINP for heading 2 should be assigned in full to LIFE+ to fund N2000 related demonstration and biodiversity management activities. The Commission only added 50 million to the amount that would have resulted from the European Council decision.

Justification LIFE+ is an extremely important financial instrument for the protection of the environment, and in particular for nature and biodiversity. The additional €100 million negotiated during the Financial Perspective was intended for Natura 2000. The importance of LIFE+ for nature and biodiversity has since increased due to the lack of adequate provision across much of Europe under the Structural, Fisheries and Rural Development funds, for example in draft programming documents.
