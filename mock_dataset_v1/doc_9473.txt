Question for written answer E-001730/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (13 February 2012) Subject: Balancing the market in Greece At the request of the Troika, the incomes of workers in Greece are being squeezed, with an average wage reduction of more than 35 %. This is contrary to the EU Treaties that safeguard the dignity of European citizens and their right to work, as it leads to the abrogation of collective labour agreements. As a result, the purchasing power of workers is being demolished and nearly half of the Greek people face problems in buying the essential goods for a decent life. In making these demands, the Troika invokes the particular circumstances in Greece owing to the economic crisis. The situation is exacerbated by the inability to control the market and the increase in prices of goods/basic commodities. It is therefore necessary to balance the market by reducing the prices of products made available to consumers in view of this trend, as the invocation of an ‘emergency’ by the Troika cannot be permitted to take effect unilaterally. In view of the above, will the Commission say: Is it prepared to grant Greece the right to intervene in the pricing of products on the market and restrict free pricing, since the market itself is uncontrolled, and to allow the Greek Government or other governments (Italy, Portugal, Spain), facing similar problems, to impose set prices on basic goods for as long as this ‘emergency’ lasts?
