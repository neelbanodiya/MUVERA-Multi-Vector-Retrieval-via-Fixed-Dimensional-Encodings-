Question for written answer E-6007/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Judith A. Merkies (S&D) and Vittorio Prodi (S&D) (26 July 2010) Subject: Impact assessments in relation to scarce materials Resource efficiency is rightly one of the flagships of the EU in the work programme 2010‑14 and beyond. An efficient and prudent use of resources should be at the root of all policies and all future projects. Therefore this policy evidently needs to be reflected at the basic level, i.e. in impact assessments. In the impact assessments, the impact of the policy on scarcity, resource use and renewability should be measured. In addition, the most efficient goal should be taken into account. Is the use of this specific resource for this policy the most appropriate, and are other industries' goals disadvantaged by increased use for what might prove to be less essential goals? 1. Can the Commission take resource efficiency into account in the impact assessments of policies? 2. Can the Commission take resource efficiency into account in the publishing of tenders? 3. Can the impact of the use of a particular resource on total global availability/scarcity of the material be measured? 4. Could the impact assessment take the use of alternatives into account? Perhaps certain scarce resources can be put to better use than by pursuing the policy or use assessed.
