Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) Following the news of the attack by NATO forces leading to the deaths of Pakistani soldiers, the High Representative/Vice-President (HR/VP) issued a public statement offering condolences to the government and people of Pakistan for the loss of life and injuries resulting from the incident on the Afghan-Pakistani border. The position of the EU has been to support efforts by both the Pakistani and NATO authorities to investigate the incident promptly. Information on the events which might have led to the attack by NATO forces was not available in the immediate aftermath of the incident. In the meantime, the findings of the US military investigation team were communicated to the press on 22 December 2011. The findings state that mistakes were made on both sides. The Pakistani authorities did not publicly launch an investigation, neither did they participate in the US investigation.
