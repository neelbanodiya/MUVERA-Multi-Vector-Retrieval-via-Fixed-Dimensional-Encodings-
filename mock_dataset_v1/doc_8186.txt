Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2007) The Commission, through its Delegation in Islamabad, has looked into the case of alleged abduction and subsequent sale of Christian children by Jumait-Ul-Daawa, which was raised in an article published in the Sunday Times on 21 May 2006. According to its information it has not been possible to ascertain the facts of this report. This is based on contacts which it has had with diplomatic missions as well as local partners connected with an EC‑funded project on child trafficking. The Commission further understands that the Ministry of Interior upon the request of one donor has conducted an inquiry into the matter. The Ministry reportedly stated there was no truth in this report as nothing has come to light that would substantiate it. Nevertheless, trafficking in human beings remains a problem in Pakistan which is a source, destination and transit country for women and children trafficked for sexual exploitation and bonded labour. Precise figures on the extent of the problem are not available. The Ministry of Interior launched a national action plan to combat human trafficking in December 2005. In 2002 the federal government introduced a human trafficking law proposing imprisonment for human traffickers and compensation to victims. However, child right activists have pointed out that the law addresses only cross border trafficking and neglects domestic trafficking. The United States (US) State Department’s last annual report in trafficking in persons (published in June 2006 for the year 2005) ranks Pakistan in tier 2 as a country making ‘significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance’ with relevant standards. The Commission is actively participating in the human rights dialogue which the European Union conducts with the Government of Pakistan. In this connection EU concerns over trafficking of human beings in Pakistan have repeatedly been raised.
