Question for written answer E-000014/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Monika Flašíková Beňová (S&D) (11 January 2012) Subject: European environmental policy At the UN climate conference in Durban, the European Union reached an agreement with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs) under which a common position of these three blocks of countries was declared. From this position stems the need for the earliest possible adoption of a legally binding agreement. It is therefore necessary to establish precise commitments and deadlines, and it is necessary to align the dates and the exact legal form of the agreement. US negotiators however still opposed specific targets because they had no mandate to sign up to a legally binding deal. How does the Commission intend to ensure that the international climate negotiations at the UN conference in Durban determine accurate and legally binding commitments and deadlines?
