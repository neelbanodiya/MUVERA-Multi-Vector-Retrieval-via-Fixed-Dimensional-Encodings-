collaboration in the context of European cooperation and development; 3. Highlights the need to make best use of complementary technologies like broadband by satellite or Wi-Fi support networks in order to achieve economically sustainable broadband coverage in more isolated rural areas without undue burdens on consumers or the industry; 4. Digital technologies are essential to territorial cohesion, giving the outermost regions of the EU a more important role; steps must therefore be taken to overcome the difficulties encountered by regions in the field of technology and services, in terms of availability, quality and pricing, and thus to bring them closer to the EU average; 5. Points out that, in addition to measures aimed at supporting the provision of broadband networks and other network technologies, it is especially important to ensure that investments are also directed towards the development of applications and programmes for the use of the IT infrastructure, which will improve the life of citizens, support the provision of online public services and enhance the quality of public administration; 6. Notes that State aid for broadband, that is to say, the use of EU funding expressly for that purpose, is an appropriate option when broadband development cannot be shown to be economically worthwhile; given that the cost in administrative and planning terms of implementing national and European broadband support programmes is considerable; calls, therefore, on the Commission, the Member States, and regional authorities , in accordance with the ‘information society’ initiatives, to ensure that conditions for support and procedures are simplified as far as possible, in order to step up the use of European funding for the diversification of ICT services; and hence help accelerate broadband roll-out by providing all market players with sufficient incentives to invest and ensure that regions, cities and municipalities can draw on maximum financial support as rapidly as possible to foster the economic development of the areas concerned; 7. Calls on the Commission to apply more investment incentivised elements within the regulatory framework and provide stimulus to use synergies from infrastructure projects; 8. Notes that European law on aid, as it currently stands is in some respects rigid and frequently leads in practice to legal uncertainty, hampering planned investment; calls, therefore, on the Commission to examine to what extent the rules could be simplified in order to establish a more investment-friendly framework so as to promote investment and innovation and remove obstacles to broadband
