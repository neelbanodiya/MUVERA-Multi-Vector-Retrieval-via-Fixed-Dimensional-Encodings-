Question for written answer P-004566/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Lorenzo Fontana (EFD) (6 May 2011) Subject: Preventive measures to counter a possible terrorist reaction from organisations linked to Osama Bin Laden or religious fanatics Following the news of the death of Osama Bin Laden, CIA Director Leon E. Panetta said that the Al Qaeda organisation still posed a threat to global security. Simultaneously, the head of the EU's counter-terrorism service, Gilles de Kerchove, stated that the US and the EU would have to continue making coordinated efforts to prevent any reaction that might occur in the wake of Bin Laden's death. Europe has already been hit by violent attacks perpetrated by organisations directly or indirectly linked to Al Qaeda or Islamic radicalism. Al Qaeda, meanwhile, has branches in both sub-Saharan Africa and the Horn of Africa — Sudan and Somalia. Given the current crisis in Libya and the period of transition that some Maghreb and Mashreq countries are experiencing, not to mention the penetrability of the borders of Libya — a strategic partner of key importance for the EU with a view to curbing migration pressure — can the Commission say whether, after these latest events, any measures are being considered to guarantee the EU's security and prevent likely terrorist retaliation from Al Qaeda or organisations linked to it?
