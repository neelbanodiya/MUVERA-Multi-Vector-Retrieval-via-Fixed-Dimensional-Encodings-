and diplomatic fields; 3. Insists that close cooperation between the United States and the European Union is not only essential both to US and European interests, but also to global interests in tackling issues such as the fight against poverty, safeguarding the environment, global trade, cultural and information diversity, the digital divide and organised crime; 4. Shares the Communication's insistence on the importance of stronger parliamentary links and more effective EU lobbying of Congress and calls for greater resources to be devoted by the European Parliament and Commission to these activities; 5. Will give a further detailed response to the Communication's proposals on the basis of a report from the responsible committee; 6. Calls on the USA and the European Union, at the forthcoming Gothenburg Summit, to demonstrate clear progress towards agreement on building a strategic EU-US partnership; on resolving bilateral trade disputes, on a common approach to European regional security, including the Balkans, on a commitment to tackling the problem of climate change, and on the launching of a new WTO Round in Qatar in November, which must address in particular the issues of third world development, environmental and social standards, and transparency and democracy in the world trade system; 7. Emphasises that global security and stability are best promoted by a strong commitment of leading nations to multilateralism in international relations and within international organisations (UN, IMF, World Bank); regrets that some early actions of the new US Administration have raised doubts about the strength of its commitment to multilateralism; invites the USA to confirm that commitment, including by settling its debts and making its financial contribution to UN bodies; 8. Is concerned that the USA’s MDS proposals could lead to a new arms race which would reduce rather than enhance global security; considers that US security depends at least as much on the strength of US political and diplomatic relations worldwide as on enhancing an already massive technological and military ascendancy; believes that these relations could be jeopardised if the USA proceeds with the MDS without convincing its allies, its principal rivals, and neutral countries that MDS does not threaten their security; 9. Points out that the European Union has in recent years, demonstrated its will and its capacity to assume a share of the burden of defending itself, initially through the Petersberg tasks and the development of the European security and defence policy; 10.
