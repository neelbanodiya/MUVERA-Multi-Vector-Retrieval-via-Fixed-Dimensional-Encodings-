Question for written answer E-9458/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Olle Schmidt (ALDE) (11 November 2010) Subject: Harmonisation of penalties within the road transport sector There are enormous differences in the amounts of fines imposed by the Member States in the road transport sector. For example, an infringement of driving and rest periods in one country incurs a fine of EUR 140, whereas the fine for the same offence in another country is EUR 4600 . Transport is by nature international and it is not reasonable for different Member States to regard the same offence in such different ways. The Commission drew up a report — COM(2009)0225 — which analysed the problem. How does the Commission intend to proceed in order to resolve the problem?
