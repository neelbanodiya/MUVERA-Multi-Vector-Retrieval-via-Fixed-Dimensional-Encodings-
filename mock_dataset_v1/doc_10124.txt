Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (22 February 2007) The majority of Community assistance to Sudan is not channelled through the Government of Sudan. This includes food aid and other humanitarian assistance granted through non-governmental organisations (NGOs) on the ground — some EUR 360 million for Darfur alone since the start of the crisis — as well as the substantial support provided to the African Union Mission in Darfur (EUR 242 million to date). Suspension of this assistance, for whatever reason, would be highly detrimental to the safety, indeed survival, of the innocent civilians caught up in this violent conflict. For the rest, Community aid to Sudan is regulated by the Cotonou Agreement and by the provisions of specific financing agreements concluded between the Commission and the Government of Sudan. None of these instruments foresee a reduction of aid to Sudan on the basis specifically of donations granted by its Government to third parties. Any decision to reduce aid for political reasons would be taken following consultation among the Member States. It is not thought that the EU is presently considering such a step in the case of Sudan.
