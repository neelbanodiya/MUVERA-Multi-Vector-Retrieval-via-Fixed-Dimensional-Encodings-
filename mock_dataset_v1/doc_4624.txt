WRITTEN QUESTION E-4548/09 by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Commission (28 September 2009) Subject: Crime Stoppers Further to the Commission's reply to my Question E‑1343/09 of 2 March 2009, for which I of course wish to thank the Commission: The Commission states that it is prepared ‘to examine the value added of this type of project for fighting crime across Europe …once a need for a coordinated European approach is clearly demonstrated’ . It also states that ‘once the need for a coordinated European approach to announcements about wanted criminals, and anonymous tip-offs, is demonstrated, Europol should be involved within the remits of its mandate’. Given that the recent developments in Spain are to be regarded as successful, I should like to hear from the Commission what criteria it uses in this connection. When, in the Commission's view, is the need for a coordinated European approach regarded as being ‘demonstrated’? Or on the basis of what, in the Commission's view, can the need for a coordinated European approach be ‘clearly’ demonstrated?
