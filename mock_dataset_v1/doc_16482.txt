ORAL QUESTION H-0373/08 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Mairead McGuinness to the Council Subject: Current situation in Burma Can the Council comment on the current situation in Burma? Since the anti-government protests were forcefully quashed, last September, the country is even more remote. While ministers have asked for help to deal with the crisis caused by the recent cyclone, the ruling military junta has yet to allow aid in. International aid agencies have called on the Burmese Military Government to relax restrictions on their operations to deal with the disaster. Does the Council agree that this disaster could have some positive outcome for the Burmese people if the Burmese Government accepted help and opened up the country to outside assistance?
