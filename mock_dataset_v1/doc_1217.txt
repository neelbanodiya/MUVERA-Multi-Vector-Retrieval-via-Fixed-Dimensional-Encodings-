treatment under the EU-Israel Association Agreement to products exported to the EU which originate from Israeli - occupied territories and for which the Israeli authorities fail to provide sufficient information to enable their real origin to be determined; 12. Takes the view that the implementation of the Convention should not perpetuate or create a situation which facilitates or encourages this abuse of the rules; stresses that the Convention should, as it states in its preamble, not lead overall to a less favourable situation than under the previous relationship between free trade partners which apply diagonal cumulation; asks the Commission to work together with the European Parliament so that the two institutions can put their political will and weight behind the efforts to find a solution to this abuse of the internal market rules; invites the Commission to put forward new proposals for a more watertight solution to this problem; 13.

Calls on the Commission to review and, if necessary, renegotiate the Technical Arrangement with the intention of making it more effective and simple; asks the Commission to seek a solution that would also be applicable to goods imported from third parties that have cumulated working or processing in their own territory with materials imported under their agreements with Israel; asks the Commission to promote the incorporation of provisions conducive to the uniform application of the principle of territoriality by all contracting parties as part of any future revision of the regional Convention; 15.
