disproportionate non-contractual barriers imposed by a trader when the consumer wishes to exercise his rights under the contract, including the right to terminate the contract. As regards concrete cases, it is, in principle, the responsibility of national authorities and courts to ensure the application of the national laws implementing EC law, including the Unfair Contract Terms Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. The Commission cannot intervene in private legal disputes or investigate the commercial practices of a particular company in the light of EU consumer legislation. This is the responsibility of the relevant authorities in the Member States. As regards the card aspect, the use of a card as a payment guarantee tool is not regulated at EU level but nothing prevents service providers or retailers from asking consumers to use their cards for this reason. The Commission Recommendation 97/489/EC 97/489/EC: Commission Recommendation of 30 July 1997 concerning transactions by electronic payment instruments and in particular the relationship between issuer and holder, OJ L 208, 2.8.1997. of 30 July 1997 on electronic payment instruments, including cards, only deals with the relationship between the cardholder and the issuing institution; therefore, it does not apply to the relationship between the cardholder and his service provider. The Commission and the Member States have set up the European Consumer Centre Network http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/redress/ecc_network/index_en.htm to help European citizens facing cross-border consumer problems. National contact points should be in a position to help consumers find a way forward to resolve the type of matters the Honourable Member has referred to.
