Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (6 December 2005) The Commission would like to refer to the recent (summer 2005) implementation reports of the national action plans on social inclusion which are a key element of the open method of coordination to combat poverty and social exclusion at EU level. These reports confirm the view of the March 2005 European Council that while the overall economic, employment and social goals set at the European Council of Lisbon in 2000 remain valid, there has been an implementation gap between the social inclusion objectives set by the Member States and their policy effort to achieve them. The Commission strongly believes that, if the social inclusion goal of making a decisive impact on the eradication of poverty by 2010 is to be achieved, there is a need for a more focussed approach with greater emphasis on results. On the measures and policies planned for the future, the Commission wishes to highlight that the conclusions of the March 2005 Council relaunched the overall Lisbon Strategy of 2000 with a refocus of priorities on growth and jobs and reaffirmed that strengthening social cohesion would remain a core objective of the European Union. The Commission would therefore like to confirm that the European Union's social inclusion process will continue as a key policy tool at EU level, on the basis of, from 2006 onwards, a streamlined open method of coordination (OMC) on social protection and social inclusion, encompassing pensions and healthcare as well as social inclusion. This OMC will run in parallel to the revised Lisbon Agenda on economic growth and employment and will feed into the economic and employment dimensions of the revised Lisbon Strategy. With regard to financial resources, the Commission wishes to recall that cohesion policy, of which the European Social Fund (ESF) with the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) are the main financial instruments, is the main EU policy that explicitly addresses economic and social cohesion within the Member States. The Structural Funds have been providing substantial support to social inclusion policies, in particular through the active inclusion into the labour market of those people who are furthest away from it.
