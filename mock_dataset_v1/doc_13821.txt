its non-compliant conduct. Another shocking case was that of the French State's refusal to admit importation of beef from the United Kingdom after that had been declared free of BSE by the European authorities ( Commission v France , Case C-1-00,). On the pretext of giving its national authorities a competence overriding the rule of law at European level, France illegally barred imports until the very eve of the conclusion of a process by the Commission, which was thereupon terminated. Similar pertinacity by a member State Government has lately been evinced by the UK in face of the Petition's Committee's inquires on behalf of aggrieved 'names' at Lloyds of London. Whether in this case the Commission has acted as a wholehearted guardian of the Treaties and of secondary law is a question with which Parliament will in the coming months concern itself, as well as with the question whether the Commission has reported adequately to Parliament. Not covered in this Report is the recent scandalous refusal of the French and German Governments to accept their obligations under the Growth and Stability Pact. Law reform achieved by a display of contempt for law by powerful states is profoundly dangerous. Governments should obey the law until it is changed by due processes. Monitoring the application of law in routine cases can be overshadowed by such grand violations.
