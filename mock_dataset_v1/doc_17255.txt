The committee notes that 17,000 Lebanese citizens are still recorded as missing and their families often receive no response from the authorities on the fate of their relations. MEPs in the committee also stress the need to observe freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and express concern at the closure of the TV station MTV last September. The committee also looks at the geo-political situation of the Lebanon, in particular the presence of Syrian troops in the country and the precarious situation of more than 300,000 Palestinian refugees living in the Lebanon. MEPs urge their Lebanese counterparts to try to reach agreement with a view to the withdrawal of all non-Lebanese troops from the country while ensuring Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The committee also wants Palestinian refugees to benefit from the Association Agreement and calls on the Lebanese authorities to ratify the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees so that the rights of the Palestinians can be better protected.
