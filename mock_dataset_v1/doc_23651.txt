the works of the IWG also makes it possible to integrate its first conclusions on governance issues already in the present opinion. These conclusions have already been endorsed by the three institutions on their last meeting of 23 March 2011. They have resulted in the amendments below dealing with: - enhancing Parliament's scrutiny powers on the agency's multi-annual strategy (opinion) and annual work programme, - monitoring tasks of the management Board, and the corresponding required skills of its members, - the setting-up of an executive Board, - preventing any conflict of interest within the Management Board, - the establishment of tailored indicators to assess the agency's performance, - the regular evaluation of the agency. Budgetary issues On strictly budget related issues, your Rapporteur identified a need for further clarification in the financial statement and the proposal's budgetary implications: - The financial statement seems erroneous since one additional post within DG MOVE is mentioned that is though already assigned to the management of the activity.
