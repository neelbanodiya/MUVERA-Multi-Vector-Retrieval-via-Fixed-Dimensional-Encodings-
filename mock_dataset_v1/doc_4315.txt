Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (17 November 2010) The EU has unilaterally committed to reduce its overall greenhouse gas emissions to 20 % below 1990 levels by 2020, and to 30 % below 1990 levels if conditions are right. The European Parliament and Council have adopted legislation that implements this commitment, namely through the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) for sectors covered by that scheme and, for non-ETS sectors, the so-called ‘effort sharing decision’ laying down targets for Member States. Directive 2009/29/EC and Decision No 406/2009/EC. Emissions and removals in the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector do not fall under any of these instruments and do not count towards the current EU target. However, the Commission is required to assess modalities for the inclusion of emissions and removals related to the sector in the EU's greenhouse gas reduction commitment and, as appropriate, make a legislative proposal See Articles 8 and 9 of Decision 406/2009/EC. . Permanence and the environmental integrity of the contribution of LULUCF must be ensured as well as accurate monitoring and accounting. To this end, the Commission is currently assessing different options and intends to submit a report by 30 June 2011. Consultative work has so far been carried out in the context of an expert group on climate policy for LULUCF under the European Climate Change Programme A summary report as well as reports and presentations on specific topics are available on http://circa.europa.eu/Public/irc/env/clim_lulucf/library and a public consultation process, entitled ‘The role of EU agriculture and forestry in achieving the EU's climate change commitments’, will run until 14 November The public consultation is available on http://ec.europa.eu/clima/consultations/index_en.htm . As regards the EU ETS, the ETS Directive states that auction revenues can be used inter alia for measures to avoid deforestation and increase afforestation and reforestation in developing countries and for forestry sequestration in the Union. Forestry credits have been excluded from the EU ETS for reasons set out in the impact assessment of the proposal to improve and extend the EU greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system.
