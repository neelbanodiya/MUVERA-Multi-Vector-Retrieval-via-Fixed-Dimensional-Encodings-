WRITTEN QUESTION E-1542/05 by Michl Ebner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (26 April 2005) Subject: Transport of animals within agricultural holdings With reference to the Commission’s answer to my Question E‑0137/05, I would like to ask again whether the Commission is finally taking account of the fact that for some agricultural holdings, particularly in mountain areas, it is extremely important that the maximum distance for transport within agricultural holdings should be raised from 50 to 100 km. These holdings have to transport their animals to and from alpine pastures and to shows and sales every year. This transportation is internal in nature, but the distances involved are often more than 65 km.
