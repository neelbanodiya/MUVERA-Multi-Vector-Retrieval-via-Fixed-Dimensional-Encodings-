Reply (22 February 2010) The Council conclusions and the action plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adopted on 27 October 2009, provide the context for EU activities in the region and include an overall assessment of the situation. The European Council, in a declaration adopted at its meeting on 10‑11 December 2009, reiterated the EU's strong commitment to promoting stability and development in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It also welcomed the announcement by President Obama of a reinforced engagement and commitment by the United States to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The EU stands ready to work closely with Afghanistan, the United States and regional and other partners in the international community in addressing the challenges in Afghanistan. The European Council underlined the need to maintain a comprehensive approach to the challenges in Afghanistan, building on a combination of political, civilian/development and military instruments. On 28 January 2010, the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the international community met in London to renew their mutual commitment to helping Afghanistan emerge as a secure, prosperous, and democratic nation. The participants emphasised that the Afghan Government and the international community were entering a new phase on the way to full Afghan ownership. The conference participants reaffirmed the goals of greater Afghan leadership, increased regional cooperation and more effective international partnership. The London conference will be followed by a conference in Kabul, at the invitation of the Afghan Government, where it intends to take forward its programme with concrete plans to deliver tangible results to the Afghan people.
