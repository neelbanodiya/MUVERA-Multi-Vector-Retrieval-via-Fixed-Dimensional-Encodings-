Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (29 July 2011) As the Honorouble Member indicates, several refineries in Europe are suffering from a shortfall in supply. High world market prices which made the Union less attractive for imports and increased refining capacity within the Union are at the origin of this supply deficit. Until 30 September 2009, the Commission had a legal basis to take specific measures for the refining industry Article 153 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. . The Council legal framework which applies since the 2009/10 Marketing year, obliges the Commission to focus on a balanced Union market as a whole. The market measures taken during the 2010/11 Marketing year have to been seen within that objective. Contrary to what the Honorouble Member indicates, the Commission did not increase beet sugar production quotas but allowed for the release of already produced out-of-quota sugar on the Unions market at zero surplus levy. Several other market measures aiming at facilitating imports have also been implemented: the EUR 98/t import duty on the CXL import quotas has been suspended until 31 August 2011 Commission Regulation (EU) No 1100/2010; OJ L 312, 27.11.2010, p. 14–15. ; exceptional duty-free tariff quotas for 300 000 tonnes of sugar Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 302/2011; OJ L 81, 29.3.2011, p. 8-9. ; followed by an additional duty-free tariff quota for 200 000 tonnes of sugar Voted during the management committee of 26 May 2011. have been opened; a standing invitation to tender for imports at a reduced import duty has also been opened 4 . These measures should allow the refining industry to reduce their supply deficit.
