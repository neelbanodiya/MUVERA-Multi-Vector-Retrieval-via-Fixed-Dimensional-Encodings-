by the ECRI and the NGOs working in this area confirm that racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination within the EU have not gone away, and in certain cases are on the increase. The terrorist attacks of 11 September and the worsening of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have, over recent months, further exacerbated both anti-Islamic and anti-Semitic tensions and violence. Faced with this situation, it is therefore essential to pursue action to combat racism and xenophobia in all their forms by supplementing and strengthening the instruments available to the EU and its Member States. I. Stepping up European cooperation in criminal matters 1. Legal background Racism and xenophobia are a direct violation of the principles of freedom and democracy and the fundamental values shared by the EU Member States, as set out in Article 6 of the TEU and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. The European institutions - particularly the EP - have on numerous occasions reaffirmed their determination to uphold fundamental freedoms and condemned racism and xenophobia. Their action over recent years has included the declaration of a European Year against Racism in 1997, the setting up in 1998 of the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, active participation by the EU in the United Nations Conference against Racism in Durban and, more recently, the conclusions of the extraordinary European Council meeting of 21 September 2001, which focused on action to combat both terrorism and any racist and xenophobic repercussions.

The two directive adopted in 2000 - one on racism in general and the other on access to employment - are founded on this provision Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000, OJ L 180, 19.7.2000, p. 22. Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16. . 2. Inadequacies of European criminal policy However, up to now, the EU's only means of taking criminal action against racist and xenophobic violence has been a joint action adopted in 1996. Although this joint action has enabled progress to be made in European judicial cooperation, it has proved inadequate - as the Council recognises in its first report on the matter Council report on implementation of the joint action of 15 July 1996, 7808/1/98. .
