WRITTEN QUESTION E-1618/04 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE-DE) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Legal basis for the proposal for a regulation establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community On 7 July the Commission proposed ‘a comprehensive package of aid and trade measures which aim to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus’. In the proposal for a regulation establishing an instrument of financial support (amounting to EUR 259 million) for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, the legal basis used is Article 308 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC). This article provides powers for measures necessary to attain one of the objectives of the Community ‘in the course of the operation of the common market’. — It is acknowledged that nobody doubts that the advantages of the Republic of Cyprus's accession to the EU ought to be obvious both for Greek Cypriots and for Turkish Cypriots. — Development assistance measures are not sufficient of themselves to prove that the pre-conditions for applying Article 308 TEC exist. — The wording of Article 308 TEC is brought into play only in the absence of any other authorising basis in the TEC, either general or specific. — Recourse to Article 308 TEC has been rather restricted because of the extensive development in the substance of the spheres of integration which make up the common internal market. In view of the above, can the Commission provide me with information as to the advisability and institutional security of the choice of Article 308 TEC as legal basis for the proposed regulation?
