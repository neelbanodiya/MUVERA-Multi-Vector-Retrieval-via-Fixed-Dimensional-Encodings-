WRITTEN QUESTION E-2289/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (28 June 2005) Subject: Danger of further cuts in funding for Greece under the third CSF According to Greek press reports, there is a danger of further cuts in funding under the third CSF, the Commission Director-General for Regional Policy, Mr Meadows, having indicated that doubts still exist regarding the adequacy of the Greek system for the management and control of funding of the third CSF and that the Commission does not exclude the possibility of proposing further cuts within a period of about six months. These reports also indicate that no EU funding applications have been submitted this year by the Greek Government! Is there a possibility that the Commission will call for further cuts in addition to the EUR 738 million (518 million + 220 million) to which the Greek Government has recently — and inexplicably — agreed? What could be the reason for such a development? Is it true that, almost half way through the year not a single funding application has been made to the EU by the deputy minister responsible? What is the reason for Commission dissatisfaction with the changes to the management and control system announced by the Government?
