Question for written answer E-8856/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Antigoni Papadopoulou (S&D) (28 October 2010) Subject: Opening of the Limnitis border crossing The opening of the Limnitis border crossing after 46 years has put an end to the suffering of the people of Tylliria, who were caught in the stifling grip of the Turkish occupation and isolated. Nevertheless, the opening of the crossing does not mean an end to the wall of occupation. Indeed, during Commissioner Füle's visit to Cyprus, the Turkish Cypriot leader, Mr Eroglou, reiterated his position regarding ‘two peoples in Cyprus’ and the need for a new partnership. In the light of the above: 1. What measures will the Commission take to compel the Turkish occupying power to withdraw its troops, which are hampering the free movement of citizens, and to apply Protocol 10 of the Accession Treaty without further delay? 2. What will it do to resolve the outstanding question of the free movement of agricultural goods from the Tylliria area throughout Cyprus? 3. Does it think that Mr Eroglou's statements will help the efforts to achieve unification of the island? 4. Does the Commission believe that there are really ‘two peoples’ in Cyprus?
