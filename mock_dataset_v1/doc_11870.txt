tropical wood products to the EU market for eradicating illegal logging, and for related trade and strengthening efforts for the conservation and sustainable use of forest resources globally; 3. Welcomes in this regard the commitments of the parties involved to improve forest governance and reform existing legislation where necessary so as to ensure that activities in the forestry sector are transparent, respectful of indigenous peoples' rights, and do not contribute to adverse environmental impacts; also welcomes the commitment of the EU to provide support for capacity building, including in particular the setting-up in timber producing countries of traceability and legality verification systems for timber and timber products; Forest biodiversity, climate and sustainable human development 4. Recalls that VPAs are motivated by the idea of jointly stopping the trade in illegally harvested timber and products made from such timber and contributing to efforts to stop deforestation and forest degradation, related carbon emissions and biodiversity loss globally while promoting sustainable economic growth, sustainable human development, sustainable food sources and respect for indigenous and local peoples; 5. Recalls that the expansion of large-scale exploitation of tropical forests and other forests with high biodiversity and carbon stock values is unsustainable and may result in further deforestation and forest degradation, contributing to the destruction of the global environment; notes the inherent tension within VPAs, in that, while encouraging the trade in timber products from countries with large areas of natural forests, the EU could undermine its objectives of combating climate change, support for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, reduction of poverty and stopping deforestation worldwide; therefore calls on the Commission to ensure that the EU policy is coherent and that actions supported by the VPAs will make an effective contribution to the international commitments of all parties to a VPA; urges the Commission and the Council to detail which additional initiatives to the VPAs are foreseen in order to combat deforestation and degradation of natural forests and to promote their protection; 6. Recalls that whilst the forests are the sovereign possessions of the state where they are located, the forest environment is a common heritage of humankind and must be protected, preserved and, where practicable, restored with the ultimate aim of maintaining global biodiversity and ecosystem functions, protecting the climate system, and safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples and forest-dependent communities; therefore invites partner governments in Africa and third countries to develop land-use
