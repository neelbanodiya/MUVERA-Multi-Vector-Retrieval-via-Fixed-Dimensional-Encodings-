(1) The European Council, meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999, endorsed (in particular in conclusion 33) the principle of mutual recognition, which should become the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the Union. Justification Following on from what was laid down at the 3 December 1998 Council meeting of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers (paragraph 45(f) of the Vienna Action Plan), Tampere European Council conclusion 33 contains a political mandate for the introduction of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and judgments, of which the initiative under consideration is an expression. It is very important, therefore, that the initiative should mention it. Amendment 3 Recital 1a (new) (1a) Pursuant to Tampere European Council conclusion 36, the existing relations for cooperation amongst the Member States must be replaced by a system under which judicial decisions on criminal matters taken both prior to and on conclusion of a trial are mutually recognised throughout the area of freedom, security and justice.

Furthermore, the establishment of such an area should constitute fulfilment of the desires expressed in Tampere European Council conclusion 36.
