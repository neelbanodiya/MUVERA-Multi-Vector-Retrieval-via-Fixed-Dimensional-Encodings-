WRITTEN QUESTION E-4532/09 by Marietta Giannakou (PPE) to the Commission (25 September 2009) Subject: Attacks on the Greek Orthodox cemetery at Baloukli During the night of 2 and 3 September 2009, extensive damage was inflicted on a large number of tombs in the historic Greek Orthodox cemetery at Baloukli in Istanbul. The Baloukli cemetery is not only a monument of inestimable cultural value, it is also a point of reference for Christianity since it is the final resting-place of the Ecumenical Patriarchs of recent centuries. Such attacks represent highly serious acts of violence against human rights and dignity and against religious freedom. These acts of vandalism occurred shortly before the anniversary of the 1955 pogrom against the Greeks and coincided with the recent statement by a Turkish MP concerning the registering of homes belonging to minorities in Istanbul. In the light of the enormous cultural value of this religious and historical site and given that the protection of fundamental rights is a basic principle of the Union, forming part of the political (Copenhagen) criteria for accession, which any applicant country must fulfil, will the Commission say: 1. whether it has been informed of this particular incident and what its position is on these acts of racial and religious hatred, 2. what steps it has taken and will take in the future to protect such monuments to the cultural heritage in Turkey, and 3. what action it will take in future to make it clear to the Turkish State that the European Union does not accept the violation of fundamental human rights or the oppression of ethnic minorities?
