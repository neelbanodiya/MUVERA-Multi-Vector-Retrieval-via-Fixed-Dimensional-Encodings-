purpose of which is to communicate the true significance of the event to the public, is clearly defined and internationally recognised as a communication tool to characterise the severity of incidents/accidents that occur. This scale is not foreseen to evaluate potential risks in case of an incident. All incidents mentioned by the Honourable Member were placed in a fairly low category on the internationally accepted INES scale, because no significant release of radioactivity to the environment occurred in any of these cases. As such, the Community instruments in place under the Euratom Treaty to protect and inform the population of the Member States would not be activated. The Commission is of the opinion that categorisation tools have to be widely accepted on an international level if they are to be useful. If changes to the current categorisation systems are discussed, this should involve all relevant stakeholders at international level. While the Commission, in the context of the study referred to by the Honourable Member, is also looking into the issue of the categorisation of incidents, a very important subject is the timely exchange of information between the responsible experts both on the operators' and regulators' side to identify precursors and to avoid the recurrence of incidents. This is a weakness that the study shows in not differentiating properly between the existing systems for incident reporting. Finally, it should be noted that the implemented safety arrangements for the nuclear installations concerned have proven to be efficient, and no radiologically significant release of radioactivity has occurred.
