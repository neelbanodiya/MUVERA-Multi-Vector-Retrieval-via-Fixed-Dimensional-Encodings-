ORAL QUESTION H-0157/04 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by James Fitzsimons to the Commission Subject: Sellafield and missing plutonium According to a news report , 'Enough plutonium to make five nuclear bombs has gone missing from Sellafield in Cumbria in the past 12 months', and 'Sellafield was found to have 5.6 kg of plutonium unaccounted for in 2001 and as much as 24.9kg in 1999'. A spokesman for Sellafield played down the figures, while nuclear experts considered the figures 'significant' and 'a serious shortfall'. The UK's Environment Agency reporting on Sellafield highlighted a number of areas where improvements were required. BNFL needed to use best practice when sampling ground water and to develop an integrated monitoring programme. The current Sellafield contaminated land study was indicating that there was potentially significant contamination of ground water. Certain discharges were above proposed limits, and there were problems with the storage and handling of 'corroded and leaking magnox fuel'. The HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate raised many concerns and called on BNFL to adopt a management strategy 'for legacy wastes and residues, which are currently stored in ageing facilites on the Sellafield site'. Will the Commission make a statement on these issues of major concern?
