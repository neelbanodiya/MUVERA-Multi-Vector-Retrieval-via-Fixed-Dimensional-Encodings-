annual accounts of the Foundation for the financial year 2008 to be legal and regular; Performance 2. Notes that in 2007 the Foundation carried out an ex-post assessment of its 2001-2004 work programme in order to determine its impact, added value and effectiveness; congratulates the Foundation on having demonstrated, by means of that assessment, that the planned operations were duly completed; notes, further, that recent information included in the assessment of the Agencies ordered by the Commission in 2009 showed that in 2008 as well the Foundation duly completed its planned operations; 3. Congratulates the Foundation on launching another ex-post assessment exercise, in this case of its 2005-2008 work programme ; calls on the Foundation, therefore, to keep it informed of the results of that assessment so that it can determine more effectively the Foundation's impact, added value and effectiveness during that specific period; 4. Calls on the Foundation to set out, in its table to be annexed to the Court of Auditors' next report, a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the discharge authority to assess more effectively its performance from one year to the next; Operating appropriations carried over 5. Notes that, according to the Court of Auditors, the amount carried over represented more than 55% of appropriations (EUR 4 900 000) for the financial year 2008; acknowledges, however, the Foundation's reply to the effect that shortcomings exist, but that the level of appropriations carried over is lower than indicated by the Court of Auditors (10%) by virtue of the fact that its annual programming in any case made provision for 45% of the appropriations under Title 3 to be carried over, in view of the duration of the study contracts and the Foundation's payment schedule; stresses, nevertheless, that this state of affairs indicates shortcomings in the planning and programming of the Foundation's operational activities and is at odds with the principle of annuality; calls on the Foundation, therefore, to take action to prevent this situation recurring in future and then inform the discharge authority of what it has done; Budget transfers without supporting documents 6. Notes the Court of Auditors' statement that budget transfers were not properly justified, since no estimate of needs had been provided and the Administrative Board had not been informed; congratulates the Foundation, however,
