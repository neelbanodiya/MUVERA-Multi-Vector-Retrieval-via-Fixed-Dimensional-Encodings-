aviation fuel. The Commission and all but two Member States agreed during the discussions which preceded the adoption of the Directive on taxation of energy products that, as a matter of principle, commercial aircraft fuel should be taxed on the same basis as any other fuel. They also agreed that the question of competition with third countries needs to be taken into account and any distortion of competition with socio-economic implications has to be avoided. Although the Community can decide unilaterally to at least tax aviation fuels used on intra-Community flights, it opted to look for agreed international solutions rather than for unilateral action. 4. The Commission is aware that distortions of competition will arise if taxation of aviation fuel is not applied in a non-discriminatory manner to all carriers, including those from third countries, operating between destinations located in the territory of the Community. Otherwise, European carriers will be disadvantaged competitively compared to carriers from third Countries. Fuel tankering in third Countries will remain a serious problem in all cases if taxation of aviation fuel has not been agreed at international level and is not applied by other important economic partners. The Commission is of the opinion that the appropriate strategy would be to pursue the discussion on this matter at international level and particularly in the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). When taxation of aviation fuel is allowed at international level, the Council would need to decide, on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, whether to abolish the exemption
