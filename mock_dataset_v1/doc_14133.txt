the interest of beneficiaries and members of any scheme’; calls on the Commission to carry out an impact assessment before revising the IORP Directive and to take account of the trend towards more defined-contribution schemes and fewer defined-benefit schemes; 33. Recalls the statements in the IORP Directive that ‘a genuine internal market for financial services is crucial for economic growth and job creation in the Community’ and that ‘this Directive thus represents a first step on the way to an internal market for occupational retirement provision organised on a European scale’; 34. Emphasises that the newly established European supervisory authority (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority) must make full use of its competences and play an important role in the preparatory process for a review of the IORP Directive, and in developing legal provisions, such as draft technical standards, guidelines and recommendations for a solvency regime; recalls that the IORP Directive should not apply to any public pension liabilities or work-related pension systems in the first pillar; 35.
