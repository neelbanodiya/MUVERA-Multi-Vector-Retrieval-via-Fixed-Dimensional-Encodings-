Union, adding that distortions and disparities in living conditions between countries were not acceptable. His address was at one point interrupted by a group of Northern League MEPs waving their flag before they were escorted out of the Chamber on the demand of President Borrell. He went on to say there was a lack of political will among national governments which hindered major Community projects, before urging Europe to re-launch its commitment to major programmes, like Galileo and Erasmus, push for a single seat at the UN and a security and peace policy, and formulate " avant-garde " initiatives for an enlarged Europe. He concluded by renewing his commitment to Europe and called on all not to let the period of reflection turn into a period where Europe is forgotten. "Long live Europe. Long live the European Union".
