yet come forward with proposals for an EU system of differentiated charges for all transport modes that takes into account marginal social costs including the external costs of air pollution and climate change, despite it being announced in the strategy that such a proposal is due in " early 2003 ". Fisheries Conversion of Fishing Vessels dependent on fishing agreements with Morocco Rosa MIGUÈLEZ RAMOS (PES, E) Report on the proposal for a Council regulation amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2561/2001 aiming to promote the conversion of fishing vessels and of fishermen that were, up to 1999, dependent on the fishing agreement with Morocco ( COM(2003) 437 – C5-0357/2003 – 2003/0157(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0407/2003 Procedure : Consultation Debate : 03.12.2003 Rosa MIGUÈLEZ RAMOS (PES, E), for the Fisheries Committee, will be tabling a non-binding draft resolution on EU-Morocco fisheries agreement. The last EU-Morocco fisheries agreement expired on 30 November 1999, forcing more than 400 vessels and about 4300 fishermen to stop their activities. The vast majority were from southern Spain (Andalucia) and the remainder from southern Portugal. In April 2001 negotiations on a new agreement broke down. Consequently Council Regulation 2561/2001 was approved, providing a financial package of €197 million for the reconversion of the fleet that had operated in Moroccan waters (of which 94.6% was earmarked for Spain and the remaining 5.4% for Portugal). At a meeting of the Fisheries Committee (20/02/03), representatives of the industry and of the Andalucian regional government explained that the rigidities of Regulation 2561/2001 have left many of those affected without access to Community aid. In particular, crew members who have lost their jobs cannot apply for the individual lump sum of €12,000 unless the owner decides to scrap or transfer abroad the vessel where they worked. In many cases, individual crew members lost their jobs or wanted to leave the sector but the vessel on which they worked is still active (it could be fishing far less than before, for example). The Fisheries Committee has consistently argued that Regulation 2561/2001 needs to be amended. amending Council Regulation 2561/2001 The Commission recognised the problem and is therefore now proposing an amending regulation. The new text [Article 1 (a)(II)] means that fishermen can now receive an individual lump sum even if the fishing vessel on which they worked has not permanently ceased its activity. The rapporteur is in favour of the amended regulation. The two amendments
