Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (22 August 2011) The Commission is aware of the action in the United States of America (USA) against advertising of products by Danone's US operation. In the EU health claims are controlled by Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods, OJ L 404, 30.12.2006. , which takes precedence over Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (‘Unfair Commercial Practices Directive’), OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. . This regulation seeks to protect the consumer from being mislead about health benefits associated with food, and prohibits any health claim which is not authorised for use. Authorised health claims must be substantiated by generally accepted scientific evidence, as assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The regulation is in the process of being implemented and the Commission is currently considering the authorisation of a generic list of permitted health claims which have recently been assessed by EFSA. The regulation also allows individual applications for claims based on emerging scientific evidence or proprietary data, and for reduction of disease risk claims and claims referring to children's development and health. One such application, for Danone's Actimel® fermented milk containing a probiotic bacterial strain and the claim to reduce Clostridium difficile toxins in the gut (of susceptible ageing people), which is associated with the incidence of acute diarrhoea, has undergone an assessment by EFSA. As a result, it was presented to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 11 July 2011 where a qualified majority opinion rejected the claim. With regard to Directive 2005/29/EC the Commission monitors its implementation across the Union and cooperates with the Member States authorities to achieve an adequate and uniform enforcement of this legislation. The Commission is now preparing a Report on the application of this directive which will be published in May 2012.
