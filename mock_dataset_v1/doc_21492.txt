Question for written answer E-005130/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Lambert van Nistelrooij (PPE) (27 May 2011) Subject: Financing of the GMES space component under the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework On 13 May 2011 the Netherlands PPE delegation in the European Parliament paid a working visit to ESA ESTEC in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. We went there to discuss the space component of the GMES project and its financing in the period 2013-20. According to ESA ESTEC, EUR 600 million per annum is needed for this, and the arrangements for financing this important programme are far from settled, inter alia because, so far as is known, the European Investment Bank (EIB)’s Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF) cannot enter into multi-year commitments. 1. Is it true that the EIB’s RSFF cannot enter into multi-year commitments between 2014 and 2020? 2. If so, will the Commission take steps to ensure that this becomes possible, so that important European projects such as GMES can continue? 3. Is the Commission aware of any other potential sources of financing for the space component of the GMES programme?
