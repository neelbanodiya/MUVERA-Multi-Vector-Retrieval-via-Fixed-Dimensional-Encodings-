Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (1 December 2011) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its reply to Written Question E‑010329/2010 . The Commission has explained in that reply that it had repeatedly condemned all manifestations of antisemitism, as these are not compatible with the values that the EU is founded upon. The Commission has also reaffirmed its commitment to fight against antisemitic hate speech in line with its powers, by making use of the instruments at its disposal. The Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia Council Framework Decision 2008/913/JHA of 28 November 2008 on combating certain forms andexpressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, OJ L 328. specifically bans incitement to violence or hatred targeted against a group of people or a member of a group defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent or national or ethnic origin. This Framework Decision also bans public Holocaust denial and gross trivialisation when they are carried out in a manner likely to incite to violence or hatred against the mentioned group or a member of such a group. All EU Member States were obliged to transpose the Framework Decision into their national legislation by 28 November 2010. The Commission is committed to following the correct transposition of this instrument as closely as possible and has set up a group of Member States' experts to this end. The Commission recalls, in this respect, that it is for the national police and prosecution services to take the necessary actions, and for the courts to sanction, according to the surrounding circumstances and context, a concrete action which represents an incitement to racist and antisemitic violence or hatred.
