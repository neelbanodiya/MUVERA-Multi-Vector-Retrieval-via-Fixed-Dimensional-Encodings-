WRITTEN QUESTION E-4937/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (11 October 2007) Subject: CAP ‘health-check’ Does the Commission agree that the forthcoming CAP ‘health-check’ and subsequent CAP reforms must seek to eliminate all forms of EU agricultural export dumping, enabling the EU to propose significant reductions in trade-distorting subsidies in negotiations on agriculture at the WTO, and most importantly limit the negative consequences?
