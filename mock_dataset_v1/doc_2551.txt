Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (29 October 2009) As regards the first question raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission wishes to point out that it does not dispose of systematic detailed statistics on the consumer price of milk at retail level for all countries. The Commission uses the consumer price data currently available at the Statistical Office of the Commission, namely the aggregate price index information at EU and Member State level referring to the product basket ‘milk, cheese, eggs’. However, additional product specific information and absolute consumer price data for some Member States are available from national sources. Concerning the Honourable Member's second question, it should be mentioned that — contrary to the situation with regard to the margins of agricultural milk producers — no systematic detailed statistics on the evolution of margins within the dairy processing, marketing and distribution sectors are currently available to the Commission for all Member States. As in the case of consumer prices, information is available for some Member States from national sources. As a result, in order to have such information at hand in the future in a systematic way, the Commission proposed the creation of a price monitoring tool for the food supply chain. Responding to the third question raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission would like to point out that it has already launched a series of initiatives to enhance the functioning of the food supply chain. The communication on ‘Tackling the challenge of rising food prices; Directions for EU action’ of May 2008 COM(2008)321 final: The communication analyses structural and cyclical factors and proposes a three-pronged policy response, including short-term measures in the context of the Health Check of the common agricultural policy and in the monitoring of the retail sector; initiatives to enhance agricultural supply and ensure food security including the promotion of sustainable future generations of biofuels; and initiatives to contribute to the global effort to tackle the effects of price rises on poor populations. set up a Task Force to examine the functioning of the food supply chain, including concentration and market segmentation of the food retail and distribution sectors in the EU. The Food Task Force produced a first report of its findings in the communication ‘Food Prices in Europe — including a roadmap to improve the functioning of the food supply chain’ adopted in December 2008 COM(2008)821
