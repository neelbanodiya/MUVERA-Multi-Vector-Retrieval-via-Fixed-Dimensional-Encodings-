The UN Convention against the Recruitment, Use, Financing and Training of Mercenaries, which entered into force in 2001, has many weaknesses and was not adopted by those countries from which most mercenaries come. Could the Council promote the adoption of a more comprehensive and effective international legal instrument, namely a new UN Convention against the use of mercenaries, aimed at forbidding any kind of mercenary activity at global level, and also the use of so-called ‘private military and security companies’ in areas of conflict abroad?
