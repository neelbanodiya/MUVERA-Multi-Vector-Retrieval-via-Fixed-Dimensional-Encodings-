WRITTEN QUESTION E-2981/10 by Graham Watson (ALDE) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Homosexuality and Burundi In April President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi signed into law a bill criminalising homosexual acts, under which homosexuality carries a penalty of from three months’ to two years’ imprisonment and a fine of between BIF 50 000 and BIF 100 000. The European Union rightly outlaws discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Nonetheless, Member States including the UK routinely deport foreign nationals back to countries where individuals can be imprisoned on the basis of their sexuality. Is the Commission aware of the case of Alvin Gahimbaze, a 25 year old who has lived in the UK for 10 years but has been ordered back to Burundi (and whose sister has successfully been granted asylum)? Will the Commission assure me that it is doing everything possible to ensure that equal rights, regardless of sexual orientation, will be observed in Burundi?
