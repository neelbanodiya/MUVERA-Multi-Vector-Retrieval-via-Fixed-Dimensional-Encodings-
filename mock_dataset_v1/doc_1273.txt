the possible opening of negotiations with Turkey on the basis of the progress report to be established by the Commission. On foreign and defence policy, the House welcomes the comprehensive agreement reached with NATO on all outstanding permanent arrangements between the EU and NATO. Parliament also welcomes the decision by the Danish Government not to extradite the leading Chechen politician Achmed Sakajes, as there were no substantial charges retained against him and reiterates its demand that the Russian Federation put all its efforts into finding a political solution to the Chechen crisis.
