from the provisions of Article 37(2) of the Vienna Convention of 18 April 1961 (including diplomatic registration plates for their vehicles), - granting ECHO experts diplomatic status in particularly difficult circumstances, - stepping up coordination with other actors (in particular OCHA and ICRC) and examining the conditions for use of the EU Rapid Reaction Force, once it becomes operational, to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid and, where necessary, provide military support for humanitarian action in the framework of existing international rules and at the express request of humanitarian actors (United Nations agencies, NGOs and others) operating on the ground; 27. Supports the grant facility for training, studies and networks in the humanitarian field and the network on humanitarian assistance (NOHA), and calls for these initiatives to be extended to a larger audience in future years; 28. Calls on all donor states to adhere to the practices, acquired over many years of experience, of a gradual approach on the ground, based on a process of building up trust with local populations, also taking into account their eating habits, and, in this respect, deplores the disastrous effect of the US air force's 'bombardment' of Afghanistan with food aid parcels in the winter of 2001-2002; 29. Recalls that humanitarian aid is politically neutral and calls therefore on all governments to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid in all circumstances; in this connection, deplores, in particular, the difficulties and obstacles encountered in war-torn and politically unstable countries and, in this respect, calls on the Commission and Members States to ensure the safe delivery of humanitarian aid; 30. Recalls its attachment to parliamentary scrutiny over EU humanitarian aid and insists, in the context of the revised Rules of Procedure adopted on 12 June 2002, that use be made of all provisions of these Rules enabling it to be exercised effectively (extraordinary debate and oral or written questions, in particular); 31. Expresses the wish that Parliament should, in future, deliver its opinion before September on the basis of an annual report published by ECHO around 31 March; 32. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the United Nations Secretary-General, the United Nations specialised agencies, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross and a broad spectrum of NGOs.
