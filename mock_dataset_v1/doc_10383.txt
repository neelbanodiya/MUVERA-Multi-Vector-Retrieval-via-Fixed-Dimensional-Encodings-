Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (6 June 2007) Each Member State has to take appropriate legal and practical measures to ensure the correct implementation of the digital tachograph. In practice, the main obligations consist of the issuing of cards to drivers, companies, workshops and control officers, ensuring the uniqueness of the driver card, approval of workshops responsible for the calibration and repair of digital tachographs, and providing proper training and equipment to control officers. The Commission is continuously monitoring the process of implementation, including the level of equipment of control officers and has already reminded the Member States, including Belgium, to take sufficient measures to provide their control officers with proper equipment. More specifically, Annex II of Directive 2006/22/EC Directive 2006/22/EC of the Parliament and of the Council on minimum conditions for the implementation of Council Regulations (EEC) No 3820/85 and (EEC) No 3821/85 concerning legislation relating to road transport and repealing Council Directive 88/599/EC, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006. provides that Member States shall ensure that standard equipment capable of downloading and analysing data from the vehicle unit and the driver card of the digital tachograph is available to all enforcement units carrying out checks of driving time. Member States have to bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive and shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions by 1 April 2007.The Commission is now carefully examining the reports from the Member States and shall if needs be undertake corrective action on the basis of Article 226 of the Treaty.
