Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (30 August 2006) The Commission understands that planning authorities referred to in the written question are public authorities in Ireland, dealing among other issues with complaints and applications. Furthermore, citizens who file applications/complaints and reveal their data (in this case contact details) afterwards receive unwanted marketing materials such as brochures or advertising packages as there is no box on applications/complaints within which to tick to accept or reject direct marketing material. In general terms, Article 7 of the Directive 95/46/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (‘Data Protection Directive’) OJ L 281, 23.11.1995. contains a number of criteria for making data processing legitimate, including that personal data may be processed only if the data subject has unambiguously given his consent. Direct marketing activities may be based on data subject's consent. In some countries, though, they may also be based on other grounds provided for in Article 7 f) by which data may be processed when ‘necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, except where such interests are overridden by the interests of fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject’. The broad wording of the directive in this case makes the legal means for direct marketing depending largely on the choice taken by national legislation, which according to Article 5 of the Data Protection Directive may determine more precisely the conditions for the processing. In any case, according to Article 14 b) of the Data Protection Directive, the data subject shall be granted a right ‘to object, on request and free of charge, to the processing of personal data relating to him which the controller anticipates being processed for the purposes of direct marketing, or to be informed before personal data are disclosed for the first time to third parties or used on their behalf for the purposes of direct marketing, and to be expressly offered the right to object free of charge to such disclosures or uses’. In the special case of the direct marketing pursued by electronic communications, the directive on privacy and electronic communications Directive 2002/58/EC of the Parliament and of the Council
