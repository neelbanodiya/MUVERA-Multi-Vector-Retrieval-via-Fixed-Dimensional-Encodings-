WRITTEN QUESTION E-0515/10 by Debora Serracchiani (S&D) , Antonio Cancian (PPE) and Jörg Leichtfried (S&D) to the Commission (16 February 2010) Subject: Cabotage for East European carriers Since 1 May 2004 and the opening of the eastern borders, road freight transport has seen a gradual loss of its routes, firstly internationally and then nationally, due to competition from East European carriers, for the most part based on cost differentials. This is having a serious impact on road haulage companies, which have been forced to reduce their transport capacity or even close down their businesses. Since 2004, carriers in Slovenia have been allowed to practise cabotage. Since 1 May 2009 this system has been extended also to Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, to the point that many companies will shortly be forced to close unless carriers' operating costs are realigned and placed on an equal footing throughout the European Union. Does the Commission not consider that the safeguard measures concerning cabotage under Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 OJ L 279, 12.11.1993, p. 1. of 25 October 1993 should be enforced? Does it intend to adopt any measures to protect national carriers from the competition practised by East European carriers?
