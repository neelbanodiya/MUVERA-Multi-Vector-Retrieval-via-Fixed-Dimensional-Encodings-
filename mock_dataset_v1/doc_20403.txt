ORAL QUESTION H-0662/03 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Carlos Lage to the Commission Subject: High-speed transport: Spain/Portugal In a sluggish economic context, the Commission, basing itself on the 1993 White Paper on Growth Competitiveness and Employment, submitted an initiative to promote an upturn in growth. According to the information received, it selected 29 investment projects focusing on the trans-European networks and scientific research. Of these 29 projects, 13 are apparently considered as priority schemes, virtually all of which concern railway infrastructure. All the projects provide for a restructuring of the trans-European networks in East-Central Europe, which will mean marginalising the Iberian peninsula. Strangely, the major high-speed rail project (TGV) for Spain/Portugal has not been included in the Commission's list of priorities. Why is this? It should be borne in mind that there is no railway alternative to the TGV project for the purposes of linking up Portugal, especially the two major cities of Porto and Lisbon, with the trans-European networks. What is the Commission's strategy and on what criteria are its decisions based?
