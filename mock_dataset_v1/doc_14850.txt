Answer given by Mr Šefčovič on behalf of the Commission (10 November 2010) The Commission's proposal COM(2010)119 final. foresaw the possibility for signatories to provide various documents (passport, ID card number, social security number) in order to cover the different national specificities. The purpose of this provision was to ensure that no citizen of the Union would be excluded and that even Union citizens residing outside the European Union would be allowed to sign up for a citizens' initiative, while ensuring the possibility of an adequate control by the Member States. In the Council, 21 Member States insisted on the need to use an identification number and the three possible documents initially proposed by the Commission were replaced by a list of the documents allowed by each Member State. Six Member States, including the United Kingdom, proposed to carry out the checks on the basis of the residence of the signatories without the requirement to provide an identification number. The discussions on this issue will continue in the framework of the ordinary legislative procedure.
