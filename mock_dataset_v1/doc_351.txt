Question for written answer E-9300/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Kathleen Van Brempt (S&D) (11 November 2010) Subject: Standardising of printer cartridges The more printer makes there are, the more cartridge formats vary. We have eventually seen standardisation taking place, for instance, for data retrieval systems (CDs, DVDs etc.) and connections (USB, UTP etc.), and the European Union has recently also decided to standardise chargers for mobile phones. At the same time there is a wide variety of formats for ink cartridges, which are also often very expensive. But it is clearly desirable for Europe to put its house in order in this area and require manufacturers to use universal ink cartridges that are compatible with all printers. Has the standardisation of ink cartridges for the consumer market ever been the subject of research of which the Commission is aware? If so, what were its findings? If not, are there any plans in this area? What does the Commission see as opportunities for and obstacles to the possible standardisation of the formats of printer cartridges for the consumer market?
