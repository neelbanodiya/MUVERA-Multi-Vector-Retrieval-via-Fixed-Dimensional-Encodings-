WRITTEN QUESTION E-4750/07 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (2 October 2007) Subject: Pollution of Lake Koronia Lake Koronia, one of the most important wetlands in Greece, is protected under the Ramsar Convention and figures among the protected areas in the Natura 2000 network Special Protection Area ‘Lakes Volvi and Lagada and Rentina Gorge’ (code GR1220009). . In 2004 the Commission opened infringement proceedings against Greece owing to the lack of a suitable protection scheme for the lake. These proceedings were closed in 2006 PV(2006)1751. , when it was considered that the necessary measures had been taken.

Given that there is a programme for the rehabilitation of Lake Koronia co-financed by the Cohesion Fund, whose objective is to revitalise the natural features of the lake Commission Decision 2005/579/EC of 20 July 2005 excluding from Community financing certain expenditure incurred by the Member States under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), OJ L 199, 29.7.2005. and that includes a monitoring programme to assess the impact of the measures on water quality in the lake, can the Commission provide the following information: Has it been informed of the current condition of Lake Koronia? What progress has been made in the programme co-financed by the Cohesion Fund? What amount of funding has been provided to date, and to what body? What specific rehabilitation measures have been taken?
