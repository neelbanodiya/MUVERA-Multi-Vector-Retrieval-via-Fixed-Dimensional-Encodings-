case, failure to provide the consumer with appropriate (i.e. complete and truthful) information relating — for instance — to the purpose of an insurance policy or to all charges and fees associated with the provision of a service may constitute an unfair practice under the directive. The Commission is currently reviewing the EU consumer contract law in order to assess whether it meets today's consumer protection and market integration objectives. As mentioned above, the Commission launched a consultation (Green Paper) to seek the views of all interested parties on how to improve the current regulatory framework. Evidence shows that consumers are not confident enough to shop cross-border and that the cost of compliance with differing consumer protection regulations deters businesses from cross-border trade. The goal of this process is therefore to create a common set of consumer protection rules throughout the EU, for the benefit of consumers and businesses alike. The consultation presented the possibility of further extending consumer protection for car hire contracts. However, only a minority of the respondents supported this option Commission's staff working document, which summaries the responses to the consultation is available at http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/cons_int/safe_shop/acquis/acquis_working_doc.pdf . On the basis of the outcome of the consultation the Commission will decide whether specific consumer rights in relation to rental agreements should be introduced. The Commission would encourage the Honourable Member to follow closely further developments in this area.
