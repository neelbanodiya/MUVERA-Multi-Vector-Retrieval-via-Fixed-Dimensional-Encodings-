Question for written answer E-005199/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (27 May 2011) Subject: Use of information by email providers Now that online technology has permeated every walk of life in the industrialised countries, an email account has become a necessity and is more or less equivalent to a signature. However, vast amounts of information are being circulated in this way and it is no secret that knowledge can mean real power. According to a report appearing on the ‘Eleftherotypia’ website of 16 May, Google is now planning to authorise targeted advertising based on message content. It is clear that Google’s much-vaunted email confidentiality is only relative. It is only to be expected that, in the course of time, similar practices will be adopted by Yahoo and Hotmail. The latter has already adopted a number of questionable practices for the purpose of obtaining and disseminating users' personal data, so as to compete with social networking sites. Clearly there is a need for action at political level to impose restrictions on this new social phenomenon. In view of this: 1. Does the Commission consider it necessary to improve user awareness of the dubious practices being adopted by email companies? 2. Does it consider that the amount of information currently concentrated in the hands of email companies could have extremely dangerous consequences for society as a whole? 3. Is it envisaging suitable and sustainable policies in response to these new social challenges, so as to ensure that consumers' rights are respected?
