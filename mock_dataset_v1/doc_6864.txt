WRITTEN QUESTION E-1473/05 by Michl Ebner (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (20 April 2005) Subject: Uranium limit values in drinking water Council Directive 98/83/EC OJ L 330, 5.12.1998, p. 32 . on the quality of water intended for human consumption sets limit values for various chemical elements and their compounds. Regarding limit values for uranium, appropriate study groups are currently analysing its detrimental effect on health. In many areas of Europe, particularly in mountainous areas, uranium is present in drinking water because it is found naturally in the rock formations and, therefore, also in water. If limit values were to be set for uranium, in the event that this element proved to be genuinely harmful to health, it would be enormously important to provide for lengthy transitional periods. In areas where uranium is present, it will be necessary in particular to find new sources of water. As construction times are somewhat lengthier in mountainous areas, an extended transitional period would be essential, at least for these areas. What is the Commission’s position on this issue?
