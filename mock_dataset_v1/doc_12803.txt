Question for written answer E-7572/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Konstantinos Poupakis (PPE) (23 September 2010) Subject: Pollution of groundwater by chromium The question of the threat to human health posed by chromium is a constant concern to scientists. Chromium is widespread in nature and abundantly present in the earth's crust. Almost all natural chromium is in the form of trivalent chromium (Cr(III)). However, the hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) present in the environment is almost exclusively anthropogenic (deriving from human activities). Various industries emit large quantities of Cr(VI) compounds into the air, water and soil. In quite a few cases, both in Greece and other European countries, residues from chromium-plating operations are frequently disposed of in unsuitable and illegal ways, polluting the aquifer. Following in-depth studies, new information has been published which supports the hypothesis that hexavalent chromium is carcinogenic both when it is inhaled and when it is swallowed. It should be noted that the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies hexavalent chromium as carcinogenic to humans, while the United States Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has also classified certain Cr(VI) compounds as carcinogenic. For drinking water, Directive 98/83/EC OJ L 330, 5.12.1998, p. 32 . has fixed the maximum permissible level of chromium at 50 mg/L. However, there is no maximum limit specifically for hexavalent chromium, something which is a source of major concern to those living close to large industries. In the light of the above, will the Commission answer the following: 1. Will the Commission take steps to review the limit for chromium concentration in drinking water? 2. Will it consider whether a new specific concentration value should be introduced for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) in drinking water?
