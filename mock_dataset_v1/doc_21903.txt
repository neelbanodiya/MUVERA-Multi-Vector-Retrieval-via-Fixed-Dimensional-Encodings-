Question for written answer E-007325/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (26 July 2011) Subject: Failure of EULEX investigations The EULEX investigations into organ trafficking by Kosovar-Albanian separatists during the Kosovo War were launched following the publication of a report by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and of a Council of Europe inquiry concluding that Kosovar Prime Minister Hashim Thaci had been involved in such trafficking. However, the former chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia recently stated that the EULEX investigations were being paralysed by internal flaws in EULEX’s investigative apparatus. In particular: 1. EULEX is unable to set up an adequate witness protection programme; 2. EULEX is not authorised to operate outside the borders of Kosovo, and has to abandon any line of enquiry that leads beyond those borders. This makes it virtually impossible for EULEX to conduct any investigation whatsoever. Bearing in mind the seriousness of the matters under investigation, the fact that even Kosovo’s political leadership appears to be involved in the aforementioned criminal activities and the fact that Kosovo and Albania are potential candidates for EU accession, does the Council think it should intervene to ensure that effective investigations are carried out in order to establish the culprits’ responsibility?
