2004/C 58 E/058 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1045/03 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (28 March 2003) Subject: Use of funds from the Leader+ programme by the municipality of Siena In September 2002, the monitoring committee of the Italian Ministry for Economic Affairs issued a report on the spending of EU funds. The report reveals the alarming slowness and inefficiency with which EU funds are allocated to projects by some regional authorities. The grave concerns about the inadequate use of European funds by local authorities have frequently been echoed by the Commission. Bearing in mind that some local authorities, such as the municipality of Siena, urgently need to use European funds to support innovative rural development measures aimed at enhancing the cultural and natural heritage, creating new jobs by strengthening the local economy and improving the organisational capacity of rural communities, can the Commission state: 1. whether the municipality of Siena has submitted projects for the Leader+ programme? 2. whether the municipality of Siena has secured funding for these projects? 3. whether this funding has been used?
