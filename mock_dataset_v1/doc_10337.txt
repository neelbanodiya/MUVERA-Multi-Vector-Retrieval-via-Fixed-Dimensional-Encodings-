ORAL QUESTION H-0313/03 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Lennart Sacrédeus to the Council Subject: Violation of human rights in Cuba In March this year, 78 opposition figures were imprisoned in Cuba. Summary trials with no chance of a proper defence or the presence of independent individuals were held in April, followed by sentences of 15 and 28 years. The prisoners are now serving their sentences under inhuman conditions, in solitary confinement or together with hardened criminals, most often so far from home as to make visits by relatives impossible. These conditions are clearly a violation of human rights. What does the Council intend to do to secure the release of political prisoners in Cuba? What is the Council doing to ensure that the treatment of the Cuban prisoners improves and that they are moved nearer to home? What steps will the Council take to support the prisoners and their relatives? What consequences will these jail sentences have in terms of further negotiations concerning Cuba's possible membership of the ACP?
