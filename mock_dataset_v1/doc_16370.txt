Question for written answer E-011338/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Konrad Szymański (ECR) (2 December 2011) Subject: Compliance of Polish law in force between 2004 and 2009 with Council Directives 2003/96/EC and 92/12/EEC In view of the contradictory interpretations handed down by administrative courts on the matter of the taxation of energy products (lubricating oils), would the Commission answer the following questions: 1. Was Poland entitled, under Article 3(3) of Council Directive 92/12/EEC, to levy excise duty under national law during the period 2004-2009 on energy products (lubricating oils) within the meaning of Article 2(4)(b), indent 1 of Council Directive 2003/96/EC without providing for a separate tax for such products and while classifying them as products covered by the harmonised excise duty arrangements (harmonised excise goods) but at the same time providing for the exemption of some of them from excise duty under certain conditions? 2.

Does the Commission intend to take steps to ensure that the law is not infringed in any way and that provisions on energy products used for non-energy purposes do not
