WRITTEN QUESTION E-6916/08 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (22 December 2008) Subject: Chinese ban on Belgian chocolate imports According to recent Italian and foreign media reports, China has placed a ban on imports of Belgian chocolate. According to the reports, the Chinese food safety inspectorate found an excessively high level of lemon yellow colouring in the chocolate. The chocolate has accordingly been declared a consumer health risk, as a result of which a number of containers are currently blocked in Chinese ports and some of the chocolate has already been destroyed. Imports of some Spanish dairy products, Italian spirits and soya bean powder from the Netherlands also appear to have been banned. This ban comes hard on the heels of the European Union's introduction of restrictions on imports of Chinese products containing excessively high levels of melanin. In view of the high volume of trade between the EU and China, restrictions on imports of specific products should be based on clear consumer health and food safety criteria. In this case, however, they would appear to be being used as a weapon in a battle that cannot but be damaging to companies throughout Europe, particularly companies that produce goods with worldwide reputation for excellence. Given the above, would the Commission not agree that it should take action to protect European products by ensuring that China only introduces import restrictions when there are sound reasons for doing so? Is so, what action does it intend to take vis-à-vis China?
