Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2006) On the basis of information currently available to the Commission, the United Kingdom, in line with its policy adopted before accession to the European Union, has adopted and is implementing the metric system, with the exception of the units referred to in Chapter II of the annex to Council Directive 80/181/EEC Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC, OJ L 39, 15.2.1980. on units of measurement. The directive requires the UK to fix a date by which they will be abolished. This directive has a number of provisions, applicable to all Member States, containing derogations and allowing for dual labelling, in particular to avoid barriers to trade with the United States. The Commission is not aware of any legal provision under Community law relating to units of measurement that confers an advantage to the UK in transatlantic trade. In this context, the Honourable Member may wish to know that it has become declared US policy to progressively adopt the metric system. Concerns of the type raised by the Honourable Member's question should therefore disappear over time.
