3 in the Budget 2005 highlights the problem for the next financial perspective. 3. This joint debate with the committee on Budgetary Control provides a good opportunity for Members of both committees to consider developments from a budgetary point of view and to get "feed back" on the situation of the Agencies in advance of the work that will be carried out in the forthcoming budgetary and discharge procedures. The meeting is also held in the presence of budget draftsmen and - women of EP's specialised committees, thus offering input that can be complementary to the budget perspective. 4. Participants will find in the meeting dossier four reference documents prepared by the Budgetary Support Service giving a detailed overview on the global PDB 2006 figures (Annex I), complementary information, provided by the European Commission in the PDB 2006 and the agencies themselves (Annex II), Resolutions on Agencies and requests made to them in the framework of the discharge procedure 2003 (Annex III), as well as specific figures concerning the agencies establishment plans and their individual budgets (Annex IV). 5. Over the past years, this meeting has provided for an exchange of views on horizontal matters concerning the agencies and specific issues agencies want to raise, e.g. to discuss issues related to the follow-up of the 2005 budget, the agencies' work programmes and staffing needs and to have an exchange of views on the preliminary draft budget (PDB) for 2006. 6. According to their founding regulations, the agencies have adopted their provisional budgets and work programmes which were communicated to the Commission before 31 March in view of the adoption of the preliminary draft budget. Therefore, the timing allows for a consideration of the agencies' requests against the decision taken by the Commission in the PDB. The context of the Budget 2006 7. It should be remembered that the Budget 2005 already provided for five new agencies; three of them had a "pour mémoire", because the legal bases were not adopted before the end of the year. 8.
