WRITTEN QUESTION E-1478/10 by Alfredo Antoniozzi (PPE) to the Commission (11 March 2010) Subject: European Progress Microfinance Facility In December, Parliament approved the creation of a ‘European Progress Microfinance Facility’ to make it easier for people who have lost or risk losing their jobs to get credit to start up their own businesses. MEPs agreed to make EUR 100 million available for the facility over four years. However, the Commission had proposed that the facility be funded from the Progress programme, a programme for employment and social solidarity, which is also targeted at the most vulnerable groups, while MEPs in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee wanted fresh money. Under the compromise, EUR 60 million will come from the Progress programme and EUR 40 million from unallocated margins in the EU budget. For 2010, Parliament and Council have already agreed to release EUR 25 million from the 2010 EU budget. 1. Will these funds be directly distributed by the Commission or by intermediaries such as banks and other organisations in Member States? 2. How exactly will the European Progress Microfinance Facility, the instrument created by the European Parliament on 11 February 2010, work on the ground? 3. Does the Commission think that it would be useful to give the competence to intermediaries with experience of granting credits of this type, such as banks, corporate banks and chambers of commerce?
