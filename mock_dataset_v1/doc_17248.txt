by the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Decision concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, in particular in the fight against terrorism (9408/2002 – C5-0317/2002 – 2002/0813(CNS)) 2. the initiative by the Kingdom of Spain with a view to adopting a Council Regulation concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System, in particular in the fight against terrorism (9407/2002 – C5-0316/2002 – 2002/0812(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0436/2002 Procedure : Consultation procedure Debate : 16.12.2002 Carlos COELHO (EPP/ED, P), on behalf of the Committee on Ctizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs will be tabling a draft resolution on a Spanish initiative for a decision and a regulation on the introduction of new functions for the Schengen Information System (SIS), in particular in the fight against terrorism. The reporter is of the opinion that improving the SIS is justified, since SIS II will not be developed until 2006. With regard to Europol, the reporter wants to make the right of Europol to search the SIS conditional upon Europol's compliance with certain data protection requirements. Europol may not transfer any data to which it has access to any third country or body outside the EU. The Joint Supervisory Body, established by the Europol Convention, is to produce and submit to Parliament a yearly report on Europol's respect of these conditions. Furthermore, the reporter wants Europol to record for every search the person or object on whom the search is run, the terminal or user carrying out the search, the place, date and time of the search, the grounds for consultation and the result of the search. Since in the SIS there are no safeguards for citizens whose identity is used by another person, the committee wants to delete the provision that information on identity documents may be searched directly by authorities responsible for issuing visas, residence permits and for the administration of legislation on aliens. Access to data by these authorities shall be governed by the national law of each Member State.
