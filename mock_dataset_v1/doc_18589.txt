WRITTEN QUESTION E-1733/05 by Mario Borghezio (IND/DEM) to the Commission (18 May 2005) Subject: EU monitoring of nuclear supplies to Iran The Belgian customs authorities' discovery of nuclear isostatic presses, or parts thereof, being supplied to Iran by a Belgian agency, EPS, has shown how permeable the security cordon set up by international authorities to prevent Iran from building nuclear devices really is. What measures does the Commission intend to take as a matter of urgency to step up anti‑nuclear monitoring arrangements so as to prevent nuclear proliferation, with special reference to Iran's atomic arms programme, which may pose a direct threat to many countries, including the EU Member States?
