ORAL QUESTION H-0233/05 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra to the Commission Subject: Reform of the sugar sector It appears that the idea of quota transfers between Member States is increasingly out-of-step with the wishes of producer countries. Parliament has begun to float an alternative idea, consisting of the introduction of a quota purchase system. In my opinion, the introduction of such a system should be conditional on a report on the impact of the reform in each of the various Member States, and producers must, in one form or another, be adequately compensated for the losses they will suffer following the disappearance of less competitive industries. Has the Commission examined alternative systems to the one proposed in the Communication of summer 2004? Does it believe that the European Union has a sufficient budgetary margin to cope with the reform of the sugar sector, in the context of the current negotiations on the forthcoming financial programming period?
