Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (30 August 2006) The visa facilitation agreement between the EC and the Russian Federation eases the procedures for issuing short-stay visas — i.e. for intended stays of no more than 90 days — to Russian and EU citizens travelling to the Schengen Member States (all Member States except the United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland) and the Russian Federation respectively. Article 5(1)(a) of the agreement provides for the issuing of multiple-entry visas with a term of validity of up to five years to members of national and regional governments and parliaments, constitutional and supreme courts of the Member States and the Russian Federation. Members of Parliament or members of the Commission are not to be covered by this provision. However, the agreement foresees some facilitations that would apply to members of Parliament or members of the Commission: certain provisions deal with members of official delegations who, following an official invitation addressed to the Member States, the European Union and the Russian Federation, shall participate in meetings in the other party. These facilitations relate in particular to the simplification of documentation regarding the purpose of the journey, the possibility of issuing multiple-entry visas (valid up to one year in a first stage and up to five years if some conditions are fulfilled for further visas) and the waiving of the fee for processing the visa application. Other horizontal provisions contained in the agreement, such as the length of procedures for processing visa applications — 10 calendar days is fixed as the standard time period for taking a decision on the issuance of a visa apply to all visa applicants and thus also to Members of Parliament.
