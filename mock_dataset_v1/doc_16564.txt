2004/C 78 E/028 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1033/03 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (28 March 2003) Subject: Famine in Africa The Commission is undoubtedly aware of the recent report from Nairobi in which the FAO points out that 14 million people in Ethiopia — out of a total population of 63 million — urgently need food aid. So far, the international organisations fighting famine have only managed to secure 40 % of the minimum requirement. Even if the ration of cereals per person is cut to 12,5 kilos — compared to the 15 kilos considered necessary for survival — stocks will run out by June. In statistical terms, the situation is even worse in Eritrea, where, out of a total population of 3,5 million, 2 million persons are in need of food, while current stocks will last until the end of April at best. Meanwhile, more than 28 % of children under five are suffering from severe malnutrition. Eritrea is also suffering from widespread livestock losses caused by the devastating drought that has ravaged the country for four years. In the light of the above, will the Commission say: 1. what aid has been given to Ethiopia and Eritrea? 2. in the light of the fall in cereal crops (four fifths lower than the average for the last decade), what measures it has taken or plans to take in cooperation with the FAO to help production to recover? 3. whether it intends to promote the training of farmers in particularly suitable cultivation techniques in order to help achieve this objective? 4. whether it believes priority should be given to promoting projects to identify and exploit aquifers, in cooperation with the governments of the drought-affected countries and other international humanitarian agencies? 5. whether the Commission is cooperating with charity organisations operating in the African regions concerned to achieve these goals, in addition to humanitarian aid activities?
