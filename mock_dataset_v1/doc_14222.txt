Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (1 March 2010) The Lisbon Treaty provides that co-decision shall in principle be the ‘ordinary legislative procedure’ in the field of fisheries. However in order to prevent the ordinary legislative processes from being clogged up with matters of detail, the Lisbon Treaty foresees the possibility to delegate certain ‘quasi-legislative’ powers to the Commission (see Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). The Treaty also allows to confer implementing powers to the Commission in cases where uniform conditions for implementation are needed (see Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). Finally, under the Lisbon Treaty Member States can be empowered to act in an area of exclusive Union competence (see Article 2(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). In this decision-making set-up, legislative action through ‘co-decision’ can be confined to essential and basic tenets of EU‑wide fisheries policy and, for the sake of quicker action decisions of a more technical nature, such as on the question of which mesh size to use to catch cod in the North Sea, can be taken by delegated acts and/or implementing acts. The adoption of delegated acts and/or implementing acts by the Commission and the exercise of any special authorisations by the Member States will have to remain fully consistent with the relevant provisions of the Treaties. The Commission would like to assure the Honourable Member that the decision-making set-up under the Lisbon Treaty is sufficiently flexible to ensure that legislative discretion is exercised in an appropriate fashion. This means that measures are taken with due regard to all relevant factors, including the particularities that exist within the different Member States and/or within different regional basins.
