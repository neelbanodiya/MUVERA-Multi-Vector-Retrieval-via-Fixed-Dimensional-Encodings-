WRITTEN QUESTION P-3209/05 by Frederika Brepoels (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 September 2005) Subject: Poultry meat The Netherlands recently gave notification of a draft law on Salmonella and Campylobacter regulations in the Netherlands (2005/0314/NL). In it the Member State lays down additional microbiological rules governing poultry meat. On 1 January 2006 the regulation (the ‘hygiene package’) implementing Article 4 of European Community Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 1 . will come into force. It envisages a harmonised, uniform approach to pathogen issues, similar to that adopted in other regulations (2160/2003 OJ L 325, 12.12.2003, p. 1 . — 853/2004 OJ L 139, 30.4.2004, p. 55 . ). Is the Netherlands initiative not at odds with the European plan? Does it not affect the smooth running of the internal market and create distortions? What attitude will the Commission adopt, given that there have already been negative reactions in a number of Member States?
