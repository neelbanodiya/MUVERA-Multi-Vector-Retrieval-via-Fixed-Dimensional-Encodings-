Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (6 February 2012) In 2009 the Commission initiated infringement proceedings against Greece regarding the level of protection for asylum applicants and the principle of non-refoulement . Greece committed to reforms on the basis of a national Action Plan. The Commission is closely monitoring its implementation and providing Greece with targeted assistance. In October 2011, the Commission reported positive developments, such as new asylum laws, the establishment of an Asylum Service independent from the police and increased recognition rates, but also drew attention to outstanding concerns, including that a significant number of asylum‑seekers are held in inappropriate conditions, in particular in the Evros region, and called on the authorities to address them swiftly and ensure that the fundamental rights of the persons concerned are respected. The Commission also provides substantial financial assistance to Greece under the European Refugee Fund, the External Borders Fund and the Return Fund. It recently adopted a decision granting Greece EUR 3.75m under the ERF to address emergency needs. Furthermore, asylum policies are part of the mandate of the Task Force for Greece established by the Commission in July 2011. It can help ensure increased absorption of EU funds aimed at improving the Greek system by, inter alia , exploring ways to increase Greece's administrative capacity. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation and support ongoing reforms, including financially, and will not hesitate, if needed, to take further procedural steps under the Treaties.
