WRITTEN QUESTION E-1623/09 by Chris Davies (ALDE) to the Commission (13 March 2009) Subject: Tracing leakage from CO 2 storage sites Is it the Commission's intention to advise the competent authorities in Member States that an appropriate substance should be added to CO 2 streams intended for permanent underground storage to facilitate identification of any leakage, and to distinguish such leakage from the natural release of CO 2 from other sources?
