to the statistics provided by the Commission, the list of countries subject to graduation next time (1 January 2006, or 1 January 2005 if it is decided to bring forward application of this new clause) is: China, Russia, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Vietnam. . 5. The main beneficiaries of the "1 % clause" will be all countries covered by the special arrangements to combat drug production and trafficking, except Pakistan ( Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Honduras; Guatemala, Nicaragua, Salvador, Panama). Argentina (which from 2005 will no longer benefit from the "crisis" clause introduced in 2003), Sri Lanka, Iran and Kuwait will also benefit from this clause. This concentration of graduation on the principal GSP beneficiaries, which maximises the benefits for LDCs and smaller economies, is fully in line with the objectives of the GSP initiative and therefore is supported by the rapporteur. 6. The second change proposed by the Commission concerns the conditions for granting the special incentive arrangements for the protection of the labour rights (the "social clause"). In its proposal the Commission suggests to apply special incentive arrangements for the protection of labour rights in a much more flexible way, in order to improve the functioning of an instrument which so far has not been very effective because the criteria were too strict Only one country has benefited so far from this clause (Moldova). Other five countries have applied but have not qualified yet (Georgia, Sri Lanka, Russia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan ). . 7. The effective functioning of the "social clause" is an objective shared by the rapporteur. The flexibility proposed by the Commission should not, however, undermine the authority of International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and the effectiveness of its supervisory bodies, and an amendment in this respect has been proposed.
