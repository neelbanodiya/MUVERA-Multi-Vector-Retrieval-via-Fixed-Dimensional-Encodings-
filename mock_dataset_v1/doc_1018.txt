Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (12 March 2008) Upon becoming aware of numerous credible reports of violence against Christians, their property and churches in the Indian state of Orissa in December 2007, the Commission conveyed its concern to the Indian diplomatic mission to the European Union. Since that time, the Commission has remained seized of this issue with EU representatives in Delhi recently expressing concern to Indian interlocutors about the protection of Scheduled Castes/Dalits, the protection of the vulnerable in Orissa and the need to ensure that such violence is not repeated.
