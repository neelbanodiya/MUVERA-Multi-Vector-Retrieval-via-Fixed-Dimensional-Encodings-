WRITTEN QUESTION E-3618/05 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (12 October 2005) Subject: Ban on the slaughter of horses In February this year, the BBC placed Italy on the blacklist of countries where the slaughtering of horse is the most widespread, with around 160000 animals killed each year. However, Italy is only the last link in a chain that also involves other countries, and in particular those of eastern Europe, from where thousands of live horses are transported without any customs checks, reaching their destination sick and debilitated. In the United States, federal funding has recently been withdrawn for anyone slaughtering or exporting horses for food. Horses are animals able to show affection which, once their working lives are over, can play an important role in areas including therapy and as company. Could the Commission therefore indicate: 1. whether it has any statistics on the slaughter of horses for food in the European Union; 2. whether it does not consider that, given the progress made in the protection of animals during transport, it is important for it to take action to prevent the indiscriminate slaughter of horses, not least with a view to a more effective safeguarding of public health; 3. whether it would not be beneficial for the European Union to consider funding projects which, through the construction of horse shelters and the introduction of a horse register, instil order into an area in which the rules are few and often ignored?
