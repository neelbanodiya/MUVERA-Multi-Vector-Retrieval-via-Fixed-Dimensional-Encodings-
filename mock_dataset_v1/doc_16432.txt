1 250 ml ethanol, heat the mixture to boiling point and reflux for one hour with stirring. Pass the hot alcoholic solution through a coarse-pored suction filter heated to 50 °C and filter rapidly. Wash the flask and suction filter with approximately 200 ml hot ethanol. Collect the filtrate and filter washings in a filter flask. In the case of pastes or liquid products to be analysed, make sure that not more than 55 g anionic surfactants and 35 g soap are contained in the sample. Evaporate this weighed sample to dryness. Dissolve the residue in 2000 ml ethanol and proceed as described above. In the case of powders of low apparent density (< 300 g/l) it is recommended to increase the ethanol ratio in the relation 20:1. Evaporate the ethanolic filtrate to dryness, preferably by means of a rotary evaporator. Repeat the operation if a greater quantity of extract is required. Dissolve the residue in 5 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture. 4.4.3. Preparation of ion-exchange columns CATION-EXCHANGE COLUMN Place 600 ml cation-exchange resin (4.3.6) in a 3 000 ml beaker and cover by adding 2 000 ml hydrochloric acid (4.3.8). Allow to stand for at least two hours, with occasional stirring. Decant the acid and transfer the resin into the column (4.3.12) by means of deionised water. The column should contain a glass-wool plug. Wash the column with deionised water at a rate of 10-30 ml/min until the eluate is free of chloride. Displace the water with 2 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture (4.3.3) at a rate of 10-30 ml/min. The exchange column is now ready for operation. ANION-EXCHANGE COLUMN Place 600 ml anion-exchange resin (4.3.7) in a 3 000 ml beaker and cover by adding 2 000 ml deionised water. Allow the resin to swell for at least two hours. Transfer the resin into the column by means of deionised water. The column should contain a glass-wool plug. Wash the column with 0,3 M ammonium bicarbonate solution (4.3.5) until free of chloride. This requires about 5 000 ml solution. Wash again with 2 000 ml deionised water. Displace the water with 2 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture (4.3.3) at a rate of 10-30 ml/min. The exchange column is now in the OH-form and ready for operation. 4.4.4. Ion-exchange procedure Connect the exchange columns so that the cation-exchange column is placed on top of the anion-exchange column. Heat the exchange columns to
