chosen the enlargement of the tariff rate quota for New Zealand for products involved as the instrument of compensation, since it is the most targeted way of compensating which country deserves compensation. Although the Commission has not done an official impact assessment, research and dialogue with stakeholders have confirmed that this agreement does not harm the EU agricultural interests, because it only restores previously existing rights of New Zealand. The EU and New Zealand will notify each other the completion of their internal procedures for the entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement will enter into force 14 days after the date of the latest notification and the rapporteur hopes that also our partner country will complete its internal procedures without delay so that producers will soon benefit from the market access.
