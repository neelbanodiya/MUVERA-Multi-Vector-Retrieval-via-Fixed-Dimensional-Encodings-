Question for written answer E-006765/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Piotr Borys (PPE) (14 July 2011) Subject: EFSA reassessment and special treatment of claims relating to microorganisms The procedure for a reassessment of general function health claims (Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006) will concern those claims which have already been assessed by the EFSA in the batches of opinions published by the Agency. In those previous scientific assessments the EFSA found a lack of sufficient scientific data to be able to confirm the existence of a cause-and-effect relationship between the food or food constituent and the declared effect, or a lack of sufficient characteristics of food constituent microorganisms causing the declared effect (claims concerning probiotics). The Commission has drawn up a list of claims requiring a reassessment and has broken them down into two main groups: — insufficient characteristics of microorganisms; — insufficient scientific evidence. In view of the above, the question arises as to why the reassessment has only been extended to insufficiently characterised microorganisms and not also to other substances which are insufficiently characterised (e.g. those referred to in the following EFSA opinion: http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/2082.htm). Why are claims concerning microorganisms given special treatment by the Commission and the EFSA? Does the Commission have any plans to reassess insufficiently characterised substances other than microorganisms, given that the guidelines for assessing claims were issued after the publication of the first batch of EFSA opinions and three years after the expiry of the deadline for enterprises to submit claims?
