Answer given by Mr Prodi on behalf of the Commission (6 February 2004) The Commission did not consider it worthwhile to refute the claims of the newspaper mentioned since its position on this question has long been clear. For example, it would refer to its answer to Written Question E-3115/03 by Mr Turco See page 50. and to its press release of 20 October 2003 entitled HIV/AIDS: European research provides clear proof that HIV virus cannot pass through condoms http://europa.eu.int/rapid/cgi/rapcgi.ksh?p_action.gettxt=gt&doc=IP/03/1410|0|AGED&lg=EN&display= . This document, which is being sent direct to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat, covers the results of research projects financed by the Directorate-General for Research (RTD) over the last fifteen years. All the available data confirm that condoms are extremely effective in preventing HIV transmission.
