by the measures are men and 26,55 % are women; whereas 79,39 % of the workers are between 25 and 54 years old and more than 10% are under the age of 24; H) Whereas the EU-budget 2011 includes for the first time appropriations in payments on the EGF budget line 04 05 01 superseding the transfer of payments from other unused budget lines; Therefore, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to integrate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution concerning the LM Glasfiber application: 1. Agrees with the Commission that the conditions set out in Article 2 a) of the EGF regulation (1927/2006) are met and that, therefore, Denmark is entitled to a financial contribution under this regulation; 2. Notes that the Danish authorities submitted the application for EGF financial contribution on 7 July 2010 and that its assessment was made available by the European Commission on 6 May 2011; 3. Is of the opinion that the statistics in the application do not give a full picture of the EU wind energy market and points to the European Statistics "Wind in Power" demonstrating that in 2009 - the period when Glasfiber decided to close down the factories - wind power capacity installed in the EU grew by 23% compared to 2008 and that wind power installations accounted for 39% of new installations, the second consecutive year that more wind power was installed than any other generating technology; notes, however, that, according to the Danish Wind Industry Association, in 2009 in total 4 000 jobs were lost in Danish wind turbines industry; 4. Notes that the EU wind power capacity installed in 2010 decreased by 10% compared to 2009; refers in this respect to the fact that the current macro-economic fragility and fiscal consolidation could lead to disturbances in financing of investments in renewable energy, inlcuding wind energy, infrastructure, of which the development heavily depends on subsidies; 5. Is further of the opinion that the EU wind energy market is set to grow further generating demand for Europe's wind turbine manufacturers and associated industries through the on-going promotion of energy from renewable sources at EU level; points in this respect to the mandatory national targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, the European Industrial Initiative on Wind Energy prioritising the development the offshore wind technology
