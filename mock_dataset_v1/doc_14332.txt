Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (5 August 2010) 1. The Commission has taken note of the statements made by Mr Amano in relation to the ‘new States’ starting their first nuclear programmes. Nuclear safety and security are and will remain an absolute policy priority for the EU. It is for Member States and third countries to decide on the role of nuclear energy in their energy mix. The role of the EU is to develop the most advanced legal framework for nuclear energy as regards safety, security and non-proliferation in the EU. The EU also urges and encourages third countries to meet the highest standards of safety, security and non‑proliferation, through bilateral agreements, increased cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and its external cooperation instruments (Instrument for Stability http://ec.europa.eu/external_relations/ifs/index_en.htm and the Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/how/finance/nsci_en.htm ). 2. For all nuclear activities, starting from the uranium mining, physical protection, material accountancy and a security culture are absolute priorities. Uranium mining in the EU is subject to the EU legislation on environmental protection Directive 2006/21/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the management of waste from extractive industries and amending Directive 2004/35/EC, OJ L 102, 11.4.2006 , covers the management of waste from extractive industries which may be radioactive, excluding such aspects as are specific to radioactivity, which are a matter dealt with under Euratom Treaty. . In addition, the EU endeavours, through bilateral and multilateral cooperation, to promote the highest standards of safety and security for uranium mining in third countries.
