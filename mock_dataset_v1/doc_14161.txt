EU Member States to carry out comprehensive impact assessments on all social security reforms, especially pension systems which may have a negative impact on women's employment and pensions rights, such as cuts in daycare and eldercare facilities, pension policies, etc.; 17. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that occupational and private pension schemes are not discriminatory against women and that they do not reinforce existing patterns that already put women at a disadvantage in terms of benefits and contributions; calls on the Commission to investigate possible discriminatory effects for women of Article 5 of Directive 2004/113/EC; 18. Welcomes the Commission Green Paper 'Towards adequate, sustainable and safe pension systems', on condition that the subsidiarity principle remains respected, and on condition that the Member States retain their responsibility and competence in regard to their respective pension policies and systems; 19. Welcomes the Commission's Green Paper 'Towards adequate, sustainable, and safe pension systems', on condition that EU-policies and possible new EU-regulations and directives guarantee that solidarity between the generations, solidarity within a particular generation, and solidarity between men and women is maintained; 20. Welcomes the Commission's Green Paper 'Towards adequate, sustainable, and safe pension systems', particularly the Commission's intention to improve the acquirement of pension rights for EU-citizens (temporarily) working in another Member State; 21. Calls on the Commission to take into consideration that the already existing possibilities for acquiring (complementary) pensions, are often too complex and high-risk; therefore encourages the Commission to enable Member States to offer more transparency and security when choosing and/or committing to a certain option, in particular for women who would benefit from complementary pension saving; 22. Calls on the Commission not to proceed with new EU-demands on defining "adequate pensions" since such a definition will not take into account the fact that, as far as the availability and affordability of other services and benefits for older persons (such as housing, care, and public transport) are concerned, there are major differences between Member States RESULT OF FINAL VOTE IN COMMITTEE Date adopted 13.12.2010 Result of final vote +: –: 0: 20 2 Members present for the final vote Regina Bastos, Edit Bauer, Andrea Češková, Marije Cornelissen, Silvia Costa, Tadeusz Cymański, Ilda Figueiredo, Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, Philippe Juvin, Barbara Matera, Elisabeth Morin-Chartier, Siiri Oviir, Raül Romeva i Rueda, Marc Tarabella, Britta Thomsen, Anna Záborská Substitute(s) present for the final vote Izaskun Bilbao Barandica, Anne
