Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (10 July 2003) As indicated in the answer to Written Question E-1801/02 by the Honourable Member, the road building projects are not, in principle, covered by Annexes I and II to Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985, as amended by Council Directive 97/11/EC of 3 March 1997, on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. In any event, it appears that the project has undergone environmental impact assessment. It should be noted, however, that Directive 85/337/EEC does not specify the criteria by which a project is to be selected from among the alternative solutions which have been examined, provided the chosen project has been properly assessed. In the absence of more specific indications of an infringement of Community law, the Commission did not feel it was expedient to contact the Spanish authorities in this instance. Nonetheless, if the Commission receives additional evidence that Directive 85/337/EEC has not been properly enforced, it will ensure that Community law is complied with.
