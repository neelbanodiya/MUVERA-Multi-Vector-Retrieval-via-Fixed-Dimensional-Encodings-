that for the purposes of assessing compliance with the directive's requirements, the Commission may also use any other available information it may receive from citizens and/or non-governmental organisations. In relation to the framework legislation, the Commission is currently assessing the framework legislation for spring hunting in Malta to consider whether the detailed proposals — including periods for hunting, the numbers of birds to be hunted and the conditions under which hunting may be carried out — comply with the judgment of the Court and the requirements of the Birds Directive. Pending the outcome of the Commission's analysis, the possibility of launching legal action under Article 260 TFEU cannot be excluded. In relation to the second question, the Commission can confirm that the hunting of birds during the spring migration in Malta it is not the subject of EU funding.
