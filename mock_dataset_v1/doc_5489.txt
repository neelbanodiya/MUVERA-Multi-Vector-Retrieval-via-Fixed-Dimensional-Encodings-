WRITTEN QUESTION P-1180/05 by Willy Meyer Pleite (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (22 March 2005) Subject: Gibraltar's tax system Last week, in the largest operation against money laundering in Europe so far, Spanish police dismantled a network whose nerve centre was a law firm in Marbella, Spain. This huge network was laundering money for organised crime on an international scale and had links in the main European countries, as well as Russia, Canada and the United States. The money was being channelled through a labyrinth of more than a thousand companies based, inter alia, in the Costa del Sol and Gibraltar. Once again, Gibraltar has hit the headlines for scandals relating to money laundering and unfair tax competition. The UK Government has reached an agreement with the Commission to abolish tax benefits for tax-exempt companies in Gibraltar by 2010. Does the Commission not consider that urgent measures should be taken to abolish tax privileges in Gibraltar for good? Does the Commission not consider, in view of the above, that the scheduled date for the application of the agreement should be reconsidered and brought forward from 2010 to the end of 2005 or beginning of 2006?
