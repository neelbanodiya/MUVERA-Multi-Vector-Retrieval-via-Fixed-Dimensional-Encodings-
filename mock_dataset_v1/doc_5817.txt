Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (18 July 2011) The High Representative/Vice-President referred to the recent events mentioned by the Honourable Member in her statement of 6 June 2011. She regretted the loss of life and injuries of civilians from IDF action, and stressed that demonstrations should be peaceful and the response measured and proportionate. She called on all parties to exercise restraint. The EU‑Israel Association Agreement is of crucial importance to the EU, as it is the legal basis of our ongoing dialogue with the Israeli authorities, including on political and international issues, as well as on respect of human rights. Engagement with Israel is the most effective way to convey to our counterpart the European Union’s concerns on matters such as the ones mentioned by the Honourable Member. Against this background, the EU does not intend to suspend the Association Agreement with Israel, but rather use all opportunities afforded by the dialogue that takes place at different levels within the framework of the Association Agreement to raise the issues referred to by the Honourable Member.
