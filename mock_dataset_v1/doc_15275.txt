Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (23 January 2012) The Commission lays great importance on the effectiveness of European Social Fund (ESF) spending. The rules on implementing the Structural Funds (SF) lay down a number of requirements for achieving effectiveness and transparency. In particular, a monitoring committee responsible for setting project selection criteria and for monitoring progress must be established for each operational programme. Such monitoring committees usually comprise representatives of civil society, including NGOs which act directly or indirectly in the interest of homeless people. The details of the membership of such committees are decided by the Member State. Partnership, a key principle to be applied in all phases of SF implementation, ensures overall transparency. The committees also play a crucial role in ensuring that spending is effective through the selection criteria set for projects to be financed by the Funds, they review progress towards meeting the objectives of the operational programme and they may propose the latter’s revision. This constant monitoring work is backed up by evaluations, including the ex-post evaluations of the 2000‑06 and ongoing evaluations of the 2007‑13 period. In addition to the instruments already in place, the Commission's regulatory proposal for the new programming period COM(2011)615 final, 6.10.2011, Article 20. provides for strengthening effectiveness e.g. through the performance framework. The framework shall allow for a performance reserve of 5 % which shall be allocated to programmes only in case their mid‑term targets are achieved. The Commission has proposed that at least 20 % of ESF resources in each Member State should be allocated in the future to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, which may cover actions benefiting the homeless.
