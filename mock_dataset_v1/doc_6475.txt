Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (11 August 2010) The two Court rulings to which the Honourable Member refers confirm that restrictions to the provision of betting services are possible under the Treaty but must be non-discriminatory, justified by a valid public interest, necessary and proportionate. It is now for the referring national Courts to carry out such assessment. The infringement proceedings opened by the Commission against several Member States have led regulatory reform, for example in Italy, France or Denmark. Further, as announced in the European Parliament on 11 February 2010 in response to oral question O-0141/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , the Commission intends to launch a broad consultation on the complex issues arising from the development of online gambling. The consultation, which will be launched this autumn, will look at pertinent issues such as prevention of fraud, consumer information, prevention of problem gambling and protection of minors. The consultation will help determine the potential responses that may be considered at European level.
