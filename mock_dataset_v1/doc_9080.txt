WRITTEN QUESTION E-0997/06 by Henrik Lax (ALDE) to the Commission (10 March 2006) Subject: Avian influenza Avian influenza has now begun to spread within Europe and may hit poultry breeders and the regions hard. Many poultry breeders may be compelled to vaccinate or isolate their fowl as part of the measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus. The EU does, however, possess one structural protective measure — decentralised food production. Centralised production would be far more risky for security of supply. The northernmost parts of the EU, for example, have avoided most of the epidemics which have affected Europe in recent years. The financial perspective for 2007‑13 will reduce the scope for developing a diverse rural economy, which also reduces the scope for maintaining food production throughout the EU. What measures does the Commission intend to take in order to strengthen further decentralised food production?
