Question for Question Time H-000104/2011 to the Council Part-session: March 2011 Rule 116 Georgios Toussas (GUE/NGL) Subject: Political opponents and trade unionists arrested and murdered in Colombia The Confederation of Workers of Colombia and the World Federation of Trade Unions have condemned the latest arrests and murders of political opponents and trade unionists by the Colombian authorities and by the regime's para-governmental groups. On 5 February 2011, Carlos Alberto Ayala, a teacher and member of the Colombian Union of Teachers, was murdered. Twenty-five teachers were murdered in 2010 alone. Does the Council condemn the murder of trade unionists in Colombia? Will it insist that those responsible are punished?
