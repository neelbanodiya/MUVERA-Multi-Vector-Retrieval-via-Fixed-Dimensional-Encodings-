The PDB had increased commitments by 4.0 % over Budget 2005 and payments by 5.9 Including Amending Budget No. 1/2005 and 2/2005 . The DB has limited the increase of commitments to 3.7 % over Budget 2005 and the increase of payments to 4.88 %. In terms of GNI, the PDB has been cut from 1.02% to 1.01%. 3. The Council, to do so, has made across-the-board reductions in some headings in the same way as in previous years. The rapporteur notes that the Council's first reading, again, aims exclusively at reducing the PDB. He firmly rejects the Council's view that this draft budget reflects real needs. 4. On the reduction of payment appropriations , not only the EP but also the Commission were very critical to the Council's indiscriminate attitude. This was especially serious for heading 3 (-516 million) but also as regards the other headings. The EP delegation took note of the Council's approach and emphasised the need for further analysis before the first reading and in view of the November Conciliation. It considered the Council's approach as unacceptable. 5. The resulting margins under the present financial perspective, in commitments, are as follows: margins (€ million)
