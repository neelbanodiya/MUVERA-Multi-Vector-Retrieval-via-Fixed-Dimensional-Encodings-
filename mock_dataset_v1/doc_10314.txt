WRITTEN QUESTION E-1914/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (25 March 2009) Subject: Information on use of funds under the continuing education action programme by the University of Urbino For the Community programming period 2007‑13 numerous financing programmes have been developed; with these programmes the EU intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. One of these is the continuing education action programme, whose general objective is to contribute to the development of the Community as an advanced knowledge-based society, promoting exchanges, cooperation and mobility between education and training systems within the Community. In this connection, the University of Urbino (Marche, Italy) requires EU financing in order to promote and facilitate mobility, exchange and cooperation projects in the area of continuing education. Can the Commission clarify whether the University of Urbino has submitted any projects under the continuing education programme? If so, could the Commission state whether the University of Urbino has obtained any financing and if this has been used within the proper time-frame and in the proper fashion, or whether the sums granted have had to be reimbursed?
