Question for written answer E-4775/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Ulrike Lunacek (Verts/ALE) and Franziska Keller (Verts/ALE) (28 June 2010) Subject: Frontex expatriation flights Since 2004, through its Frontex agency, the EU has been participating, both financially and in an organisational capacity, in joint operations by Member States to deport third‑country nationals by aeroplane (Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 OJ. L 349, 25.11.2004, p. 1. ). Human rights organisations regularly highlight the lack of independent oversight to ensure observance of fundamental rights on these return flights. Austria has entrusted the task of such oversight to a body which works solely for the Interior Ministry. Both human rights organisations and the Interior Ministry’s Advisory Council on Human Rights believe that this body’s independence cannot be guaranteed. The Commission proposal for an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 puts forward several improvements with regard to the oversight of return flights and the observance of fundamental rights (Proposal for a Regulation No 2010/0039 (COM(2010)61), Article 9(2‑3). 1 How can the Commission guarantee oversight of and respect for fundamental rights on joint return flights? 2. Have the Commission’s calls, in its Proposal for a regulation No 2010/0039, for a mandatory code of conduct for Frontex come in response to the current difficulties? 3. Is the Commission in favour of having independent observers on board joint return flights? 4. How could a system to monitor observance of fundamental rights on joint return flights be organised in practice? 5. What means does the Commission have at its disposal to address abuses of fundamental rights by Member States on joint return flights? 6. What guarantees are there that inadequacies in national asylum systems will not lead to illegal expulsions on joint return flights? 7. On what basis are the various national provisions applied on joint return flights (in the case of Austria, for example)? 8. Why is Austria a hub for joint return flights? 9. What services does the EU pay for on joint return flights from Austria?
