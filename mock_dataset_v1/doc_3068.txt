regular monitoring. Agri-environmental indicators are key tools in this respect and should be further developed. 3. Rural Development Policy offers Member States the means to pursue coherent and effective environmental strategies in the field of agriculture. The design of Rural Development Programmes (RDPs) has to be coherent with the respective national strategies in view of meeting the needs of the rural areas, which include the targeting of measures towards environmental objectives (Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), OJ L 277, 21.10.2005. ). In agreeing on the Community Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development (Council Decision 2006/144/EC 2006/144/EC: Council Decision of 20 February 2006 on Community strategic guidelines for rural development (programming period 2007‑13), OJ L 55, 25.2.2006. ), the Member States have made clear commitments also with respect to the environment. In this respect, the Strategic Guidelines refer to the priority areas of biodiversity, high nature value farming and forestry systems, traditional agricultural landscapes, water and climate change. In view of providing for a comprehensive assessment of RDPs, a Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework (CMEF) has been established. The Member States are currently carrying out the mid‑term evaluations of their RDPs. The result of this exercise is due by the end of 2010, which will also allow drawing conclusions on the coherency and effectiveness of environment-related measures. 4. Regarding olives, like any other agricultural product, the organic claim can only correspond to certified production in accordance with the European standard for organic farming which is fixed in the European legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91, OJ L 189, 20.7.2007. and related implementing rules). The organic claim usually brings value added to the product. Organic farming policy follows the orientation set in the action plan COM(2004)(415) final. , which emphasises the adjustment of production to demand.
