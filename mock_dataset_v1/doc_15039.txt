system. Your rapporteur acknowledges that the harmonisation process is difficult, as there are intrinsic limits to it. However, he wishes to encourage this process and would stress that the fragmented implementation of our trade policy and common customs rules, split as they are between all national administrations, is a serious handicap which constantly obliges the Commission to make great efforts of coordination. The establishment of a customs administration Your rapporteur understands that the reform of the Customs Code is a priority for the Commission and that it is already a sufficiently complex task without being combined with institutional reform. However, he wishes to open up a debate on the establishment of a European customs civil service by proposing that consideration be given to the possible creation of integrated and coordinated national customs administrations, with a view to moving towards a Community administration in charge of the customs union. Indeed, the increasingly pro-harmonisation nature of the customs rules means that the role of customs is in practice becoming identical throughout the Union. In view of the long periods of time required for developments to take place in the Community, especially those which affect the prerogatives of the Member States, your rapporteur believes the time has come to put this issue on the table. It is an issue which is both symbolic, in that it is the crowning achievement of 40 years of increasingly advanced customs integration, and pragmatic, in that it reflects the need for a more efficient customs organisation in an increasingly complex, fast-moving world which will not wait for us.
