ORAL QUESTION H-0585/07 for Question Time at the part-session in September I 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Karin Scheele to the Commission Subject: Spring hunting of migratory birds in Malta In contravention of EU nature conservation law Malta allowed spring hunting of certain migratory birds in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. In March this year the European Parliament adopted a resolution ( P6_TA(2007)0074 ) on hunting and trapping of migratory birds in Malta, urging the Commission to redouble its efforts to persuade the Maltese authorities to comply fully with Community law. Why did the Commission fail to heed this parliamentary recommendation and to take the next official step in its infringement proceedings against Malta to halt spring hunting? Furthermore, can the Commission explain how it will ensure that spring hunting does not occur in 2008?
