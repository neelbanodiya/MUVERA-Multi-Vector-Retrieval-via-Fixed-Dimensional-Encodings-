Reply (18 October 2010) Based on the 1998 mandate of the Working Party on Schengen Evaluation OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, p. 138 . and continually updated Schengen Evaluation Programmes, experts are carrying out periodic evaluations in the Schengen States as regards the SIS. The Council would like to refer to the annex to the report on the implementation of Article 102A during the year 2006 15629/07. , submitted to the European Parliament, in which the Member States consider it appropriate to clarify inter alia that: — ‘The data entered into the SIS in accordance with Article 102A cannot be considered personal data if they are limited to numerical data identifying vehicles by reference to the chassis number. In fact, although subparagraph (c) of paragraph 1 of the article 102A does not specify what type of information should be entered, since the sole purpose of the search is to check whether vehicles … have been stolen, misappropriated or lost , the link between the registration number and the VIN (vehicle identification number) can be sufficient for achieving this objective; — With regard to the implementation of Article 103, this does in fact refer only to the recording of personal data. Its inclusion in the report is intended to draw Member States' attention to the limits to which they are subject in entering data, as referred to in the previous paragraph.’ There are no European Arrest Warrants, as such, in the current SIS. Nevertheless, they can be attached to alerts under Article 95 of the Schengen Convention OJ L 239, 22.9.2000, p. 19 . and they are automatically deleted on the date of their expiry. Otherwise, they are deleted as soon as the persons concerned are surrendered to the requesting Member State. The SIRENE manual amended in 2006 OJ L 317, 16.11.2006, p. 1 . now contains procedures on the handling of a misused identity. For example, it states that ‘Subject to the condition mentioned below, the photographs and fingerprints of the person whose identity is misused should also be on file at the SIRENE Bureau of the issuing Member State.’ Furthermore, the manual states that ‘This information can only be processed with the free and explicit permission of the person whose identity is misused.’
