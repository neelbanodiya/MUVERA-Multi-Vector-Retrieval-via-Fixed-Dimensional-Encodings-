WRITTEN QUESTION E-2424/06 by Marc Tarabella (PSE) to the Commission (7 June 2006) Subject: Mismanagement by the Commission of the funding allocated to specific projects in support of consumer policy Since the Commission still refuses to reply to the various points which I raise in my Question P‑1562/06, I have no option but to repeat my requests in the hope that this time I will receive the information requested, rather than purely rhetorical and evasive statements: — On what study, theory, work programme or report does the Commission base its peremptory assertion that the ‘performance of tests and the publication of magazines’ is the priority means of furthering not so much publishing companies as the protection and defence of all consumers, including the tens of millions who are unable to afford the magazines in which such tests appear? Is the Commission not aware that such methods have never worked in some of the older Member States? — How is the Commission intending to support associations which carry out no tests and sell no magazines but merely provide answers to consumers' everyday problems? — Has the Commission acquainted itself with Decree No 611/2006 issued by the Italian Council of State on 15 February 2006, pursuant to which the largest Italian testing organisation is to be permanently removed from the list of consumer organisations and in particular excluded from the projects financed by the Italian authorities on account of its commercial and financial activities? — Will the Commission nonetheless continue to allocate over 76 % of its funding to organisations of that kind, on the grounds that they allegedly ‘fully meet the objectives of increasing the safety and improving the quality of products on the market, of informing consumers and of building up the capacity of consumer organisations in the new Member States’? — Has the Commission made clear to all the organisations and partners which submitted a project in 2005 the precise reasons why their projects were rejected, with a view to ensuring that, in 2006, the projects submitted by major organisations are not the only ones accepted?
