among Member States; 37. Considers that biomass and bioenergy production will play a strategic role in the future of the agricultural sector in the EU; calls in this respect for appropriate EU funding to promote the production of biomass on land no longer required for growing food and feed; recalls in this respect the high capacities of the new Member States, and the increased overall production potential of the enlarged EU; 38. Underlines that fulfilment of the specific needs of the Member States and regions, including problems and difficulties in the new Member States, should be maintained on the basis of subsidiarity with the following, tailor-made instruments: a) introduction of a revised system of direct payments, including the introduction of new measures such as voluntary recoupling options, to be used only by those Member States which consider this necessary to meet social, employment and sustainability objectives; extension of the payments to new sectors and new beneficiaries (for example soft fruits destined for processing), within the revised system of national financial envelopes and full Community financing, b) introduction of additional, optional, regional or temporary market measures with Community financing, c) application of the national envelope system from the EU budget in the sectors to be reformed (wine, fruit and vegetables), d) improved support to producer organisations, strong encouragement for them and repeal of national legislation which hampers them, e) promoting cross-border cooperation between producer organisations, f) introduction of an efficient agricultural crisis and risk management system with Community financial assistance, paid from the national envelopes, g) strengthening the internal market with common quality standards, marketing, competition, food safety, environmental and animal welfare rules, h) reinforcement of the rural development system and its funding, i) increase of the flexibility of the state aid rules (e.g. widening the scope of block exemptions and increase of the "de minimis" level); 39.
