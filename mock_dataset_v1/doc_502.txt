Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (10 July 2007) No illegal immigrants have been imprisoned or detained by the Frontex Agency Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union, OJ L 349, 25.11.2004. . The Commission would point out that Frontex's mandate does not empower it to imprison or detain immigrants.
