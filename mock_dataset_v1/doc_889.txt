WRITTEN QUESTION P-2407/10 by David Martin (S&D) to the Commission (12 April 2010) Subject: Animal welfare in Bulgaria Is the Commission aware of street traders in Bulgaria (some with very young children) trying to encourage tourists to have photographs taken with capuchin monkeys and reptiles? Given that Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007 and completed a Cooperation and Verification Mechanism this month, does the Commissioner find this practice within the EU acceptable, and if not, can the Commission outline what it intends to do to end this practice?
