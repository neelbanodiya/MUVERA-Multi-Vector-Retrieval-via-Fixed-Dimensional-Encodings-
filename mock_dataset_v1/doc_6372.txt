there is no feature of design or construction, either in the main bonnet mechanism or in the safety catch, which is liable to cause risk of personal injury or death. Rather, VOSA takes the view that the evidence suggests that the problems reported by vehicle owners are most likely to be the result of a combination of inadequate maintenance and incorrect closure of the bonnet. Finally, it is worth noting that VOSA has examined the test data available (British periodical inspections for vehicles over three years of age) on the reasons for failure and advisory notices. VOSA has found no significant difference between the percentage of Renault Clio Mark II vehicles (1998‑2002) that failed the inspection or were given advisory notices relating to bonnet retaining devices and those in relation to any other Class 4 vehicle. In view of the above information, the Commission has closed the investigation of the matter.
