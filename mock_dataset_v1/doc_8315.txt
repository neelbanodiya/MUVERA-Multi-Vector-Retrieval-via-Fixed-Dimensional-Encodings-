WRITTEN QUESTION E-0921/08 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (25 February 2008) Subject: Surgical reconstruction of the hymen According to press reports in January, there has been a marked increase in ‘hymenoplasty’ operations in Belgium, i.e. surgical reconstructions of the hymen. The debate as to whether such operations should be covered by the social security system, which is possible under Belgian legislation, is going hand-in-hand with the ethical debate within the medical profession as to the need and appropriateness of performing hymenoplasty, since it places women at physical risk without any medical justification whatever. But given that, for the most part, these operations are being carried out on young Muslim women who lost their virginity before marriage, the issue goes beyond the medical profession, and forms part of the general controversy over the moral contradictions which arise from a demographic situation in which, as far as certain social sectors are concerned, EU Member States' law co-exists alongside Islamic traditions. In reality, from the point of view of a constitutional state, these activities are the result of traditions which constitute an attack on the sexual freedom of women, and represent a threat to their physical integrity. But at the same time, there is also the issue of the threat of social exclusion, above all within the Muslim community in which these women's families live; but also, to some extent, in the western society in which they have grown up, where they find themselves falling between two schools in a permanently contradictory situation, and are the victims of serious misunderstanding on both sides. For these reasons, the issue can be read in two ways with regard to the dignity and rights of women. Furthermore, from a universal point of view, the situation is the result of an infringement of women's human rights and personal freedoms, but this does not get round the fact that in their more day-to-day environment, hymenoplasty offers the form of support which solves these women's problems insofar as it allows them to exercise their own individual freedom, without suffering social prejudice within their immediate social surroundings. In view of the foregoing and the fact that this situation is not exclusive to one Member State, but occurs in several, what does the Commission think of hymenoplasty, and all the implications involved? What mechanisms exist, or are going to be established, to combat the risk of social
