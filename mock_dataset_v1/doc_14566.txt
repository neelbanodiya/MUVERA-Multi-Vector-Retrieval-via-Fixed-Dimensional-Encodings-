Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2009) Directive 96/53/EC Council Directive 96/53/EC of 25 July 1996 laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic, OJ L 235, 17.9.1996. lays down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic. Article 4 of the directive permits, in national goods transport, vehicles or vehicle combinations with dimensions deviating from those laid down in the directive to circulate in their territory if the transport operations carried out by such vehicles do not significantly affect international competition in the transport sector and this is defined as operations carried out by specialized vehicles and operations carried out according to a modular concept. As far as trials are concerned, the directive also permits Member States to allow vehicles or vehicle combinations incorporating new technologies or new concepts which cannot comply with one or more requirements of this directive to carry out certain local transport operations for a trial period, with the stipulation that the Member States shall inform the Commission. However, the current legislation excludes the possibility of operating in cross-border transport vehicles outside the maximum weights and dimensions limits stipulated in the directive's Annex A.
