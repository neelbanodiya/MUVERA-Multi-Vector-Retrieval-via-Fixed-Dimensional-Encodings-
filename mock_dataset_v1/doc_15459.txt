Reply (14 February 2006) It is not for the Council to make comments on the views of the Chief Prosecutor, who acts within the rules established by UN Security Council Resolution 827/93, independently of any country, international organisation or entity and indeed of the other organs of the ICTY. Negotiations with Croatia were opened on 3 October 2005. The issue of full cooperation with the ICTY will continue to be followed by the Commission, on the basis of regular reports from the Tribunal. In case of lack of full cooperation, the Commission will report to the Council.
