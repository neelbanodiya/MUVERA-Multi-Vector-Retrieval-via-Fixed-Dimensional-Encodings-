The House stresses that trade and investment must be put at the service of development and the wellbeing of communities. The House also calls for the EU to pursue a consistent policy on development aid for developing countries by reforming its agricultural and trade policies, as well as its fisheries policy, with a view to promoting sustainable development and combating poverty in an effective manner. The resolution calls on the Commission to strengthen or, where necessary, re-establish, the systems guaranteeing minimum prices for certain products that are crucial to the survival of millions of people in the developing countries, as in the cases of coffee and cocoa. MEPs call on the EU to defend, above all in the WTO, the position that certain essential goods such as water and land cannot be left to market forces alone. Finally, the Parliament requests that the Commission accept the ACP group’s request concerning the creation of a joint ACP-EU committee to monitor the WTO negotiations.
