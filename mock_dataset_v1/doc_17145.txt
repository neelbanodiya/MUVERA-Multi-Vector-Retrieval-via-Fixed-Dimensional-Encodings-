Question for written answer E-007584/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (1 August 2011) Subject: Protection of the marine environment The three marine mountains located between Majorca and the Pitiusas Islands — Ausiàs March, Ses Olives and Émilie Baudot — constitute a marine oasis which is home to species of major ecological importance. According to scientific studies published in 2010, the area has at least 29 protected and documented species, including colonies of bamboo coral and other life-forms of world significance. These species now risk extinction, thanks inter alia to the lack of proper regulation of dragnet fishing. It is proposed in a report by the NGO ‘Oceana’ that this zone be designated a Protected Marine Area. Article 8.G of Part III of the proposal for reform of the CFP states that ‘other technical measures’ may be adopted and, therefore, regulated. Article 13.1 of Title II of the same document, which concerns measures to be taken by the Commission in case of severe threat to marine biological resources, states that the Commission may adopt measures to conserve the biological environment. What action will the Commission take to regulate dragnet fishing in order to prevent its current disastrous impact on the marine environment? In the context of the abovementioned Article 13.1, will the Commission adopt the proposal made by the specialist NGO ‘Oceana’ that a Protected Marine Area be created for the marine mountains Ausiàs March, Ses Olives and Émilie Baudot? If not, will the Commission urge Spain to adopt measures to protect those marine mountains?
