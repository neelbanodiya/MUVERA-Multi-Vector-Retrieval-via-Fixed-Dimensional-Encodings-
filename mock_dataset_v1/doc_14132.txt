more effectively the directives on health and safety at work; EU 2020 STRATEGY 27. Welcomes the reference in the 2020 Strategy to the inclusion of older workers in the labour market; regrets that the 2020 Strategy devotes no explicit attention to decent, sustainable and adequate pension systems, although the attainment of some of the objectives presented in the 2020 Strategy depends on them; suggests, therefore, incorporating the objectives of the Green Paper in the 2020 Strategy; 28.

Recalls the statements in the IORP Directive that ‘a genuine
