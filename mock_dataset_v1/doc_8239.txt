Question for written answer P-002856/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Riikka Manner (ALDE) (23 March 2011) Subject: Nutrient recycling Nutrient recycling represents sustainable use of natural resources and is environmentally sound. The use of recycled nutrients has also been found to be safe from the point of view of keeping soil and products free of contamination. Nutrient recycling is the basis for a green economy, which is sorely needed, for example, in the Baltic Sea environment. The reinsertion of nutrients into the cycle of use is regulated and directed at many levels. In the European Union, for example, the subject is governed by the Waste Directive and the Water Framework Directive. It would be possible to recycle nutrients, for instance, from livestock manure or municipal refuse. However, in order to optimise nutrient ratios, specialist knowledge and expert handling are required, which should be taken into account both in legislation and in financial support for the required specialist knowledge. Does the Commission consider recycling of nutrients to be environmentally beneficial? Will the Commission review both legislation and financial support so as to take better account than at present of the above concerns?
