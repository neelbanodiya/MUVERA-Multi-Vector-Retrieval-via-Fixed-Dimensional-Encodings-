child poverty will take place in October 2007. The results of these initiatives will feed into the preparation of the 2008 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion. The initial results of the task-force show that children are often at greater risk of poverty than the overall population (19 % versus 16 % in the EU‑25 in 2005). The proportion of children living at risk of poverty ranges from 9-10 % in the Nordic Countries to 25 % or more in Romania, Lithuania and Poland. In all countries, the largest groups of children at risk are children living in lone parent households or large families, children living in jobless households or in households in situations of in-work poverty. Social transfers alleviate to varying degrees poverty of children across the EU. 3. In addition to the initiatives mentioned in paragraph 2, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the following: — the 2008 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion to be adopted by the Council and the Commission in February 2008 will notably draw on Member States' replies to a questionnaire on the existing policies and measures to tackle poverty and social exclusion of children; — the first meeting of the European Forum on the Rights of the Child was held in June 2007, following the publication in 2006 of the Commission's Communication COM(2006)367 final. on this subject; — the Commission has launched studies on lone parent families, on the prevention of child poverty, and on means to break the intergenerational transmission of poverty.
