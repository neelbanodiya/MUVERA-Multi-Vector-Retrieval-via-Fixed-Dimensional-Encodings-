developing the use of solar power, followed by promoting advanced research for new energy technologies (41%) and developing the use of wind power (31%), whilst regulation to reduce dependence on oil (23%) and developing the use of nuclear power (12%) are less appreciated among respondents, S. whereas the EU should take advantage of its massive potential to save energy in all sectors, including transport, as well as to develop new renewable energy sources and technologies, T. whereas energy is a vital resource for economic growth, employment and social development and whereas disturbances in the supply of energy may create instability and can endanger peace, SPEAKING WITH ONE VOICE 1. Welcomes the new Commission Green Paper on a secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy for Europe; notes, however, that the Green Paper does not propose new targets or advance concrete proposals that would respond to recent calls for a common energy policy; urges the Commission and the Council to ensure a rapid political process in order to achieve a more ambitious European energy policy, encompassing a concrete plan of action as soon as possible; demands that the European Parliament be fully consulted in that process; 2. Notes that the Green Paper fails to address vital sectors that rely heavily on imported sources of energy, in particular transport and aviation; considers that the Green Paper is less ambitious with regard to transport than the Commission report on CARS-21; 3. Notes that recent disputes over gas prices between Russia and its neighbours, but also the recent increase in the price of crude oil, have revealed the vulnerability of the supply and distribution of energy; notes that energy policy in the narrow sense has to be connected with foreign and security policies; calls on the Commission to respond to recent calls for a common energy policy; 4. Calls on the EU to take the initiative to establish broad cooperation with all the large oil and gas consuming countries – the US, Japan and large emerging economies such as India and China – to work out a comprehensive and global strategy with a view to organising the demand side and combining their efforts in counterbalancing the oligopoly on the production side; insists that this strategy should also promote best technologies for energy saving and efficiency and the use of alternative energy sources; 5. Recognises the importance of good political relations with the EU's major energy
