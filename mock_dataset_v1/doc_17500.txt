Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and amending and repealing certain Regulations - Council Regulation (EC) No 1264/1999 of 21 June 1999 amending Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 establishing a Cohesion Fund alongside the negotiations on the current financial perspective and led to the opening of the 2000-2006 programming period. Three Structural Fund objectives were set for the current programming period, namely: § Objective 1 : development and structural adjustment of regions lagging behind in development terms (i.e. in which per capita income is less than 75% of the Community average); § Objective 2: economic and social conversion of regions in structural difficulties; § Objective 3 : adjustment and updating of education, training and employment policies and systems. 6. The Community initiatives (Interreg, Urban, Equal and Leader+) and innovative measures and technical assistance account for 5.53% and 0.51 % of the total allocation respectively. Lastly, structural operations in the fisheries sector (outside Objective 1 areas) are allocated 0.5% of the total. 4% of the total allocation is entered in the performance reserve. 2006 budgetary procedure 2004 and 2005 implementation 7. Overall, the payment rate increased from 89% in 2003 to 99% in 200 4. The overall improvement is mainly due to the earlier programmes lines, given that the payment rate for the 2000-2006 programmes was already high (96%) in 2003. Most 'objectives' executed quite well in 2004, though there is clearly room for significant improvement in FIFG outside Objective 1 and Innovative Measures and Technical Assistance.
