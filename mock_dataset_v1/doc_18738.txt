Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (14 April 2009) The Guidance for identification and naming of substances under Regulation on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH, guidance on substance identification Commission Regulation (EC) No 134/2009 of 16 February 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as regards Annex XI, OJ L 46, 17.2.2009. ) to which the Honourable Member refers is in accordance with the respective provisions of the REACH Regulation Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC, OJ L 396, 30.12.2006. . The provisions of REACH, including the obligation to register, are based on the differentiation between ‘substances’ and ‘mixtures’ As a consequence of the recent entry into force of the regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the word ‘preparation’ within the meaning of Article 3(2) REACH was replaced by the word ‘mixture’. . This differentiated approach together with the general definitions of ‘substance’ and ‘mixture’ have been established, used and considered as proportionate for decades before the adoption of REACH and taken on board by this regulation. In the past, similarly, only substances (existing ones) had to be reported under European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (EINECS) reporting rules or notified (new ones) under Directive 67/548/EEC Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances, OJ 196, 16.8.1967. . For mixtures there were no such obligations. Therefore the fact that the registration obligations apply only to substances and not to mixtures should not be seen as disproportionate. Article 3(1) of the REACH Regulation defines a substance as ‘a chemical element and its compounds in the natural state or obtained by any manufacturing process, including any additive necessary to preserve its stability and any
