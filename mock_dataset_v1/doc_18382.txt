9999/C Q999 E/039 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0691/04 by Dominique Souchet (NI) to the Commission (25 February 2004) Subject: Systemic insecticides On 23 February, the French Ministry of Agriculture announced a ban on the sale of any products containing Fipronil, an insecticide molecule, as a preventative measure following the charges brought against Bayer Crop over the possible toxicity to human or animal health of agricultural products containing this molecule. Does the Commission intend to draw any particular conclusions from the decision to introduce a ban in keeping with the precautionary principle? With regard to beekeeping more specifically, does the Commission plan to take measures identical to those taken in France? How does the Commission intend to follow up the resolution on measures to improve the production and marketing of honey ( A5-0381 /2001), adopted by the European Parliament on 13 December 2001, which noted that 'extremely serious damage has been caused to bee populations in several Member States by systemic insecticides with extremely long residual activity periods'?
