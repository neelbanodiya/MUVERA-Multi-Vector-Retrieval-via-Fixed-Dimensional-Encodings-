would allow those countries which do not consider themselves at this stage in a position to ratify the Convention on Cluster Munitions to take a first step in this direction. The adoption of a meaningful protocol on cluster munitions in the CCW framework, complementary to and compatible with the CCM, involving all major military powers, could be an important further contribution and would result in a significant improvement in the situation on the ground with regard to cluster munitions. The EU participates in all CCW meetings taking place in Geneva in order to promote these views.
