Question for written answer E-4369/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (16 June 2010) Subject: Protection and restoration of the site of a monument from classical antiquity in Athens The temple of Artemis Agrotera was built in the 5th century BCE and was preserved almost intact until 1778. Six attempts to expropriate the site since 1964 have come to nothing because of the administration’s failure to carry them through http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_civ_2_15/01/2010_386819 . Citizens’ initiatives http://www.artemisagrotera.org/gr/default.asp and the media claim that the true reason is the political influence of the site’s owners, including political figures and powerful business interests. The procedure to place the site under effective protection was frozen indefinitely at the beginning of 2010 and there is no prospect of it being resumed Minutes of the meeting of the Central Archaeological Council http://www.artemisagrotera.org/gr/documents.asp , The meeting of the Central Archaeological Council (KAS) of the Greek Ministry of Culture on 13 January 2010 discussed the proposal to declare the site as a Protected Area A, which would have definitively prevented it being built on. The decision was postponed indefinitely (cf. link to the KAS) at the request of the proprietors, and to allow them a better hearing. There are no plans to discuss it further in the foreseeable future. . Some parts of the Greek Ministry of Culture consider that, in view of the state of the country’s public finances, the sum of about EUR 3.5 million needed to compensate the owners is prohibitive, with the result that the site is at risk of being built on. 1. When the Memorandum with the Greek Government http://www.parliament.gr/ergasies/nomosxedia/ValidNomosxedio/1436/M-DNTAMEIO-PAP.qxp.pdf was drawn up, was provision made to ensure sufficient public funds for necessary or urgent measures to protect cultural assets with a wider European significance? 2. Is Greece’s probable failure to protect this site compatible with its obligations under the European Conventions on the protection of landscape and archaeological heritage? 3. Does the Commission intend to examine the possibility of European co-funding in specific cases, including expenditure on expropriation?
