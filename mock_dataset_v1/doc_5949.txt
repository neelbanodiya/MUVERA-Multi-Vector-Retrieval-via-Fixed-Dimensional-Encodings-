This was also to apply to seeds imported from third countries. For which Member States does the Commission have test reports for 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003? What are the results of the individual tests (in terms of the detection of GMO impurities, frequency and quantity etc.)? What measures have the Commission and the Member States taken where GMO impurities have been discovered in seedlots?
