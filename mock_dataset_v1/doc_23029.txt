WRITTEN QUESTION E-0070/09 by David Martin (PSE) to the Commission (19 January 2009) Subject: Senegal and EPA — follow-up With reference to my Question E‑4202/08, according to the Commission’s website on the common fisheries policy and Senegal, between 2002 and 2006 the Community’s financial contributions totalled only EUR 64 million, of which just EUR 3 million was spent annually to promote conservation of resources and sustainable development. Can the Commission provide more detail on the extent to which it intends to improve upon its support to the Senegalese Government’s coastal surveillance efforts?
