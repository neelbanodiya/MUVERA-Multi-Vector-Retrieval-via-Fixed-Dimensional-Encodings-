WRITTEN QUESTION E-2060/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (30 March 2009) Subject: Information on the use of the Civil Protection Financial Instrument by the municipality of Turin For the Community programming period 2007‑13 numerous financing programmes have been developed; with these programmes the European Union intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. One of these is the Community civil protection mechanism, in support of which the Civil Protection Financial Instrument was established. The general purpose of this instrument is to support and complement the efforts of the Member States for the protection, primarily of people but also of the environment and property, including the cultural heritage, in the event of natural and man-made disasters, acts of terrorism and technological, radiological or environmental accidents and to facilitate reinforced cooperation between the Member States in the field of civil protection. In this connection, the municipality of Turin (Piedmont, Italy) requires EU funding to support civil protection efforts. Can the Commission clarify whether the municipality of Turin has received financing through the Civil Protection Financial Instrument? If so, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Turin used the funds in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether the subsidies had to be reimbursed?
