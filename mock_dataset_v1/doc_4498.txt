that not only enjoy the support of local, regional and national governments and the European Union but also benefit from equal participation of men and women; 33. Urges the Commission firstly to gather and analyse gender-differentiated data on inshore fishing and secondly to identify and propose solutions to the specific problems facing women in inshore-fishing communities, in cooperation with the future European Institute for Gender Equality; 34. Notes that the health of women directly involved in inshore fishing may be affected by often difficult working conditions, but that in the majority of cases their lack of a legal work status means that they do not enjoy equal conditions of access to the health system; therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide a rapid solution to this problem by adopting the necessary measures to guarantee those women's economic and social rights, and in particular their right of access to social security and health services, together with measures aimed at improving their safety and preserving their health in the working environment; 35. Believes as a matter of principle that inshore fishermen, small-scale processors and other coastal entities directly involved in or affected by inshore fishery activities should be involved in the management of the sector; 36. Calls on the Commission to consult with the inshore fisheries sector and to ensure the active involvement of that sector at the appropriate policy level in the decision-making process, which directly affects them; 37. Believes that the Regional Advisory Councils have an essential role to play in this context; 38. Requests the Commission to report back to Parliament concerning any initiative involving specific treatment for inshore fisheries; 39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments of the Member States.
