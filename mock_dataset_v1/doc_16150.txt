Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (20 October 2004) Under the Research Framework Programme VI, the Council adopted two Decisions on 30 September 2002 Council Decision 2002/834/EC of 30 September 2002 adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: "Integrating and strengthening the European Research Area" (2002-2006), OJ L 294, 29.10.2002 , Council decision 2002/835/EC of 30 September 2002 adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration: "structuring the European Research Area" (2002-2006), OJ L 294 , 29.10.2002 specific to programmes to be carried out by the Joint Research Center (JRC). In its Annex III, it is provided for that the JRC promotes the mobility of young scientists. In this context, the JRC decided to engage young scientists up to the age of 35. In order to guarantee equal treatment for both sexes, an exception to the age limit was inserted for childcare (with a maximum of one year per child). The same Annex III to the two above mentioned Decisions allows the JRC to engage other types of personnel, such as visiting scientists and seconded national experts, who would, in the main, be more experienced scientists. Notwithstanding this, in line with Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of age in employment, occupation and vocational training, it is the Joint Research Centre’s intention to remove the age limit from future ‘Calls for Interest’ for research fellows.
