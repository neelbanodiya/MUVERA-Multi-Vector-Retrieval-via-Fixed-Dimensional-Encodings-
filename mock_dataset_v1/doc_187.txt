WRITTEN QUESTION E-1400/08 by Giulietto Chiesa (PSE) to the Commission (12 March 2008) Subject: Independence of Community judges who have served as officials of Community institutions The first paragraph of Article 223 and second paragraph of Article 224 of the Treaty establishing the European Community stipulate that the judges in the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance respectively should be chosen from persons whose independence is beyond doubt. In the vast majority of cases brought before the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, the European Commission is involved as a party. However, at present, the judges in the Court of Justice and Court of First Instance include prominent figures who have held high-ranking positions in Commission agencies, and in some cases in its actual Legal Service. 1. Does the Commission agree that, as a rule, a Community judge who has served as an official of a Community institution, offers fewer guarantees of independence, at least in cases in which that institution is a party, than a judge who has never held any positions of responsibility in that institution? 2. Will the Commission avoid a recurrence of cases in which former Commission officials have been appointed as judges in the Court of Justice or Court of First instance, for instance: (a) by proposing an amendment of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities aimed at introducing a provision permanently barring anyone who has held a position of responsibility in the Commission from becoming a Community judge? or (b) by immediately inserting a provision into its Code of Good Administrative Behaviour obliging all staff members to abide by this rule?
