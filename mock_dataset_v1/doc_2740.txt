As of now, what agreements has the Union formally reached with immigrants' countries of origin and of transit? To what extent are these agreements being complied with? Are the agreements being complied with in respect of contracting immigrants at source? What forecasts exist with regard to contracting highly qualified individuals and less skilled workers?
