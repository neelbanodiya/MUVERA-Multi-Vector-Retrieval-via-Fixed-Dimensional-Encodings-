Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2007) The Commission has no direct contracts with the organisation Emergency in its country programme in Afghanistan. Moreover, where Commission financed actions are implemented through the United Nations (UN), the UN is required to inform the Commission of any subcontracting and no such subcontracting with Emergency has been notified to the Commission services concerned. No cases of subcontracting with Emergency have been notified by the World Bank either for actions financed by the EC implemented through this organisation.
