Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (24 May 2011) Equipment using ionising radiation, including certain detection equipment used for security screening, need to respect the legal requirements set by Directive 96/29/Euratom Council Directive 96/29/Euratom of 13 may 1996 laying down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionizing radiation, OJ L 159, 29.6.1996. . In particular the following main principles apply: — justification of the equipment's use before being first put in operation regarding its economic, social or other benefits in relation to the health detriment it may cause; — optimisation of protection to ensure that the radiation doses from the practice are kept as low as reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account; — limitation of the exposure to ensure that the sum of the doses from all relevant practices will not exceed the legal dose limits for workers or the general public. Ensuring compliance with the above provisions, including making an evaluation of the potential risk to health associated with the use of a given technology before allowing its deployment, falls under the responsibility of the national authorities. The deliberate exposure of people to ionising radiation for non-medical reasons, including for security purposes, is given specific consideration http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/radiation_protection/doc/art31/2010_02_24_opinion_on_bss.pdf in the ongoing recast of Directive 96/29/Euratom with other Directives, in particular Directive 97/43/Euratom Council Directive 97/43/Euratom of 30 June 1997 on health protection of individuals against the dangers of ionizing radiation in relation to medical exposure, and repealing Directive 84/466/Euratom, OJ L 180, 9.7.1997. on medical exposure.
