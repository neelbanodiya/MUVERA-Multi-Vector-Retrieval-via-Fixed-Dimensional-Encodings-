WRITTEN QUESTION E-6620/07 by Pedro Guerreiro (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (15 January 2008) Subject: Situation of the textile and clothing sector in the European Union — support measures and means of funding The abolition of quotas in the textile and clothing sector has had serious socioeconomic consequences, especially in areas where the industry plays a predominant role. What measures are being taken and what financial means have been set aside for the textile and clothing sector in the 2007‑13 financial framework, with a view to: — promoting measures to tackle the mountain of problems and the scale of the difficulties faced by families affected by unemployment because jobs have been destroyed and firms have closed down or relocated; — assessing the areas and sub-sectors facing an imminent or potential threat of company closures, and hence unemployment, so as to enable preventive measures to be taken according to the circumstances; — increasing and adjusting sources and terms of funding according to the needs of micro, small and medium-sized textile firms, not least those which are starved of capital and structurally unbalanced; — attracting other industries, including those linked to textiles and clothing, offering higher added value and a greater technology and innovation component, thus making for the necessary industrial diversification in regions in which the textiles and clothing sector is highly concentrated?
