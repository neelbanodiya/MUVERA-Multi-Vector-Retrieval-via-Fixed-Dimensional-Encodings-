WRITTEN QUESTION P-3853/06 by Toine Manders (ALDE) to the Commission (7 September 2006) Subject: Abuse of monopoly by FIFA Following the recent corruption scandal in Italian professional football, the sport tribunal in Rome, on appeal, ordered the relegation of Juventus to Serie B. Juventus considers this punishment disproportionate and therefore intends to appeal to the civil courts against the ruling by the sport tribunal. Unless the Italian football federation, FIGC, acts to prevent this, there is a risk that FIFA will suspend the FIGC. FIFA believes that it has the power to do so on the basis of Article 61‑2 of its statutes, which lays down that it is prohibited to bring legal proceedings before the ordinary courts unless FIFA decides otherwise. According to FIFA's Statutes, disputes may be considered only by the judicial bodies of FIFA or the FIGC, the Italian Olympic Committee or the International Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, and not by an ordinary court. 1. Is the Commission aware of the above case? 2. Does the Commission agree that, by adopting this position, FIFA is violating Article 82 of the Treaty in that it is using its monopoly in an unlawful manner? If so, what will the Commission do about this, and how soon? If not, why not? 3. Will the Commission institute an inquiry in order to establish whether the above provision and other articles of the FIFA Statutes comply with European competition law, particularly Article 82 of the Treaty? If so, how soon? If not, why not? 4. Ought professional sports to be regulated by the EU? If so, how? If not, why not?
