Question for written answer P-010381/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Giommaria Uggias (ALDE) (11 November 2011) Subject: Ascertaining the cost of the Flotta sarda (Sardinian fleet) and whether European competition rules have been breached In the course of the current year the maritime transport sector operating between Sardinia and the Italian mainland has been in deep crisis, with a significant decline in passenger — and, consequently, tourist — numbers. In an attempt to tackle this crisis, last May the Autonomous Region of Sardinia set up (initially as a temporary measure, from 15 June to 15 September, and more recently as a permanent measure until the end of the year) the so-called Flotta sarda , with two vessels leased from the Saremar company, to operate on the Olbia-Civitavcchia and Porto Torres-Vado Ligure routes. The Region has played an ambiguous role in this operation, the desirability and transparency of which is somewhat dubious. Instead of playing its allotted role in transport sector planning, ensuring that continuous links between the island (and its inhabitants) and the mainland are maintained and checking that the Tirrenia ferry operator fulfils its obligations in connection with the state-subsidised crossings for which it was awarded the concession, the Region has turned itself into a ferry operator through Saremar (formerly a subsidiary of Tirrenia). The huge sums of public money spent on this operation amount to millions of euro, for which no accounts have yet been presented in respect of the summer season. The announcement that the Region is to resume operating crossings implies that further — and greater — amounts of public funds will be used, despite there being no clear correlation between the Region’s institutional role and its commercial activities. Is the Commission aware of this situation? Does the Commission consider that this use of public resources amounts to state aid? Does the Commission agree that the management of the relevant accounts would appear to be in clear breach of European competition rules?
