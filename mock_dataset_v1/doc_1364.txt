Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (25 May 2011) The Commission is finalising the proposal for the future trans-European Transport Network (TEN‑T). On the basis of the proposals submitted by the Member States, a revised TEN‑T Comprehensive Network is being designed. The ‘Via Carpathia’ Project is an initiative of several European countries to develop a road-transport link from the Baltic to the Black Sea. The common declaration is signed by Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Greece. The goal of the initiative is to develop the transport infrastructure in the eastern parts of the EU and to integrate the route in the trans-European transport network. The national delegations refered to this initiative during their meetings with the Commission in preparing the TEN‑T revision. The Commission will be presenting its proposal for TEN‑T revision later this summer.
