Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (29 March 2010) The common agricultural policy (CAP) so far has been contributing to the Lisbon Strategy and the future ‘Europe 2020 Strategy’ objectives for a socially inclusive and greener economy, and is ready to contribute even more in the future. As a result of fundamental reforms over time, the CAP has moved into a policy that emphasises market orientation and competitiveness, income support, environment and the development of rural areas contributing positively to inclusive societies and social cohesion throughout the EU. In addition to that, through targeted measures the CAP has been able to help the restructuring of agriculture and facilitate the creation of jobs by mobilising and connecting local actors in the rural areas. In this context, the CAP direct payments support will be essential for the continuation of empowering people in inclusive societies by offering a stable income to farming activity. For the future and particularly for the post 2013 period, the Commission will study and evaluate different options for the direct payment system. The CAP will continue pursuing its objectives of improving market orientation, increasing competitiveness, ensuring the provision of public goods and contributing to tackling climate change, while providing job opportunities in rural areas, in line with EU strategic priorities.
