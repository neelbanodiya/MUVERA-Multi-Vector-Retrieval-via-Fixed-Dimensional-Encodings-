WRITTEN QUESTION E-3294/07 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Council (28 June 2007) Subject: The environmental impact of the dual location of the EP A report from the Green Group in the European Parliament on 24 April 2007 found that the monthly trek by the EP from Brussels to Strasbourg not only costs the taxpayer more than EUR 200 million a year but it also generates over 20 000 tons of carbon dioxide every year. Given that a decision on a single seat for the Parliament requires the unanimity of the Council, can the Council state whether it has undertaken its own investigation into the environmental impact of the current dual location of the EP in Brussels and Strasbourg? If so, what were the findings? If not, does the Council intend to sanction such a report?
