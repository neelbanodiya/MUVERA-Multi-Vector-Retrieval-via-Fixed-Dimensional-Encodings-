ORAL QUESTION H-0002/05 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by John Purvis to the Commission Subject: Road transport accidents Is there any evidence that drivers from left-hand-drive countries are more likely than residents to be involved in road accidents in right-hand-driving countries and similarly right-hand-drivers in left-hand-driving countries? Are European road accidents increased in number and severity because some countries drive on the right and others on the left?
