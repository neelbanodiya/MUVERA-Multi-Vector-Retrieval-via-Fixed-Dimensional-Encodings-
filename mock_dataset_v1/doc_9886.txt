and night work; 20. Stresses that the Commission must ensure that separate laws cover overtime night work and that the uncertainty regarding the method of calculating maximum working time is removed, and accordingly that an overall ceiling on permitted work is clearly set out; 21. Stresses that since the right to paid leave is a fundamental right, it must be guaranteed for all categories of workers, in proportion to the period of employment spent with an employer; special care should be taken to ensure that paid holidays are included in short-term employment contracts; 22. Stresses that replacing paid leave with compensation is not wholly compatible with the directive; 23. Calls on the Commission to coordinate the monitoring of the application of the Working Time Directive with the monitoring of compliance with the obligations imposed within the framework of the directive on the health and safety of workers, so that the level of protection of all workers regarding health and safety can be assessed as a whole; 24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission and the parliaments of the Member States.
