Question for written answer P-006087/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Fiona Hall (ALDE) (20 June 2011) Subject: Aster Fissehatsion Further to the Commission response (E‑001903/2011) on 8 April 2011 concerning the case of Aster Fissehatsion, the former director of the Eritrean Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs who has been detained without charge or trial since 2001, there have been recent, unconfirmed reports that Aster has died. Can the Commission urgently ask the Eritrean authorities if Aster has died and, if she has, that her body be returned to her family? If she is still alive, can the Eritrean authorities confirm where she is being held and if she is in good health? Can the Commission also ask the Eritrean authorities to disclose information on the location and health of the other members of the G15 group who are imprisoned in the country?
