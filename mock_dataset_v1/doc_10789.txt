WRITTEN QUESTION P-6287/09 by Gabriel Mato Adrover (PPE) to the Commission (11 December 2009) Subject: Bananas According to recent press reports, Commissioner Fischer Boel has stated that the long-lasting dispute between the EU and banana-exporting countries could soon be ended by the conclusion of an agreement to reduce tariffs on banana imports from Latin America. The European Union has negotiated a compensation package for the ACP countries worth close to EUR 200 million for financial damages they may suffer as a result of this reduction in tariffs. Under the draft agreement currently being negotiated, import tariffs will be gradually reduced in seven stages from EUR 176 to EUR 114 per tonne. This reduction will undoubtedly have serious repercussions for the EU banana market and the income currently received by European producers. Could the Commission provide details of the agreement with the Latin American countries and the compensation planned for the ACP countries? Will the Commission analyse the consequences this agreement could have for European producers? Does the Commission not think that European producers also deserve compensation for damages caused by reduced tariffs and to avoid any discriminatory treatment against them in favour of ACP country producers?
