9999/C Q999 E/084 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2397/03 by Joan Vallvé (ELDR) to the Commission (10 July 2003) Subject: Legislation on fermented milk In the Commission's answer to priority written question P-0027/03 Not yet published in OJ. and to my written question E-0873/03 Not yet published in OJ. on the denomination yoghurt , Commissioner Fischler states that the Commission received several complaints concerning the Spanish legislation, based particularly on Directive 2000/13/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 OJ L 109, 6.5.2000, p. 29 . on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs and that it was currently examining these complaints and the legal situation in the Member States as regards the denomination of yoghurt. In its turn, the Codex Alimentarious Commission, which was created in 1963 by the FAO and the World Health Organisation (WHO) and is an international reference body that reports to the United Nations and the WHO, adopted a standard on fermented milk at its meeting in Rome at the end of June 2003 that makes it impossible for desserts pasteurised after fermentation to be denominated yoghurts , at least in countries without any legislation governing this area. In the light of the above, and to avoid creating any further confusion, how would the Commission view the introduction of common legislation on fermented milk and regulation of the denomination yoghurt ?
