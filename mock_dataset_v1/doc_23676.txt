to establishing strong interparliamentary links with the future Parliament of Kyrgyzstan; 8. Stresses the common interest of Kyrgyzstan, its neighbours, Russia, China, the EU, the US and the rest of the international community in preventing destabilisation and the spread among frustrated and fearful populations of a perception that extreme ideologies offer the only prospect of more order and a better life; 9. Expresses its concern about the difficulties of the democratisation process in Kyrgyzstan which seem to stem from the weak nature of Kyrgyzstan's interim government and the strength of criminal networks in the country, including of drug-smugglers in southern Kyrgyzstan; believes that creation of a political system which permits representation of different interests and arbitration between them is nevertheless necessary for reducing tensions and avoiding new eruptions of violence and that the EU and EU Member States must actively support democratisation and strive to reduce the gaps between the attitudes of international actors, so as to improve the prospects for the reform process in Kyrgyzstan; 10. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the parliaments and governments of the Member States, the interim government of Kyrgyzstan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Secretary-General of the OSCE and the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.
