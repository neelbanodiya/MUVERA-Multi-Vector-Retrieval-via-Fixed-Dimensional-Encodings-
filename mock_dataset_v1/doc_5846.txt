2004/C 70 E/250 WRITTEN QUESTION P-3184/03 by Olivier Dupuis (NI) to the Commission (20 October 2003) Subject: Arrogance of the Lao authorities On 26 October 1999 five young Laos — Thongpaseuth Keuakoun, Sengaloun Phengphanh, Bouavanh Chanmanivong, Khamphouvieng Sisaat and Keochay — were arrested with dozens of other demonstrators for having organised a peaceful march in Vientiane involving students, teachers, civil servants and Lao citizens who were calling for democratic reform, measures against corruption, reforms to achieve more social justice and a multi-party system. Four years later, despite numerous appeals and despite preferential trade agreements and enormous cooperation efforts by the European Union and its Member States, the Lao authorities have not deigned to make the slightest gesture, even a humanitarian one, towards the five prisoners of conscience. Neither the International Red Cross nor Member State Ambassadors nor Commission representatives nor officials of the United Nations and other international organisations have been authorised to visit them in prison. In addition the Vientiane authorities have not even accepted that they should honour the promises made by their representative at a parliamentary meeting in Strasbourg to clarify contradictory reports by various government officials concerning the conditions in which the five desaparecidos of the demonstration of the 26 October have been brought to justice. Moreover, according to well-informed sources, it seems that Mr Khamphouvieng Sisaat has not been seen for over a year, while Mr Thongpaseuth Keuakoun has become very weak and has lost the use of his legs. Has the Commission received precise and reliable information on the judicial and health situation of the five desaparecido leaders of the Movement of 26 October? Does the Commission not think the Lao authorities' attitude to the European Union in this affair borders on contempt and far exceeds the limits of decency? Does the Commission not also think that even more than towards Burma (which is not said lightly) the European Union should take an extremely firm and determined approach towards the Lao authorities so a process of democratisation and national reconciliation can be achieved effectively and as a matter of urgency? To this end, is the Commission willing to inform the Lao authorities, notably at the bilateral EU-Laos meeting to be held in Brussels in November in the cooperation agreement framework, of its intention to freeze EU funding to Laos if the Vientiane authorities do not give precise undertakings in respect of ambitious democratic reform
