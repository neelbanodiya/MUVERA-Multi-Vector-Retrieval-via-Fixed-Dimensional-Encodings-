Question for written answer E-3603/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Salvador Garriga Polledo (PPE) (25 May 2010) Subject: European observatory on employment conditions The different employment conditions in the European Union influence the way in which each eurozone economy deals with a question which is of vital importance in shaping its productivity and coordinating its parameters in relation to other members of the monetary area. With this in mind, and to secure progressive harmonisation in this field and ensure that all members of the eurozone have the same employment conditions, the Union would be advised to set up an observatory so that the different EU Member States can review their labour recruitment systems on a comparative basis and make the necessary changes that will help harmonise them. This would provide a common basis for assessing productivity. Does the Commission therefore believe that an observatory on employment conditions in the various Member States needs to be set up so as to harmonise this highly important parameter of the general economy which needs to support the pillars of the eurozone?
