Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (6 February 2012) The Register of Commission Expert Groups and Other Similar Entities and the Joint Transparency Register are two different instruments and should remain separate. The first Register lists all consultative entities assisting the Commission in relation to the preparation of legislative proposals and policy initiatives, the implementation of existing Union legislation and policies and the preparation of delegated acts. The second Register has been established jointly between the Parliament and the Commission OJ L 191, 22.7.2011 : http://europa.eu/transparency-register/index_en.htm to register organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making and policy implementation as part of an effort to provide transparency on organisations (including lobbyists) having activities carried out with the objective of directly or indirectly influencing the formulation or implementation of policy and the decision-making processes of the EU institutions. The Register of Commission Expert Groups and Other Similar Entities includes, in principle, the names of all members of expert groups. The Commission has outlined on several occasions how this Register ensures transparency, most recently in its reply to parliamentary Question E‑590/11 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB .
