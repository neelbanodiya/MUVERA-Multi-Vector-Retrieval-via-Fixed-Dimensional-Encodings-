MEPs would like the Commission to provide all details on past assistance, current aid and a summary of fraud, mismanagement and corruption related to the funds and resources allocated by the EU. Furthermore, MEPs want to assess how the EU has investigated such cases and the extent to which it has succeeded in recovering losses. Finally, where it has not been possible to recover losses, has the EU suspended aid? If not, why not? Can the Commission assure MEPs that it will give MEPs full access to all documents, including cases under investigation, and that the EU delegation in the country concerned will cooperate fully with MEPs in their mission to report to Parliament?
