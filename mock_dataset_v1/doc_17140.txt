Question for written answer E-007577/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Maria Da Graça Carvalho (PPE) (1 August 2011) Subject: Pilot projects — opportunities for innovative SMEs Pilot projects are a key instrument for formulating political priorities and introducing new initiatives which could become EU activities or programmes, as is stated in Parliament's working document of 3 February 2011 on pilot projects and preparatory actions in the 2012 budget. Account needs to be taken of point D of Annex II to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006. The proposal for a new pilot project 02 02 03 08 entitled ‘Pilot Project e-Tendering in Europe — opportunities to innovative SMEs’ and entered in the 2011 budget procedure under the DG Enterprise budget line was B-rated by the Commission, signalling the possibility of its partial or total execution. For the 2012 procedure, the same proposal for a pilot project has been entered under the DG Internal Market budget line and has been C-rated by the Commission. This means it has not been accepted, on the grounds that a specific programme already exists in the same field. What actions are already planned under the 2011 budget, and what are the Community programmes in existence that cover the same field? To what type of programme does the Commission refer when it says it is preparing to launch studies and set up an expert group for collecting experiences of successful cases of e-tendering and disseminating best practice? Has this programme already been initiated? What is the membership of the expert group? When will its conclusions be ready?
