Question for written answer E-012614/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nessa Childers (S&D) (11 January 2012) Subject: EU assistance in the event of excessive snowfall The levels of snow over the past two winters have been very high by modern standards. As such, many national and local authorities have struggled to meet the demands brought about by this new weather phenomenon, and the public has been disrupted accordingly. As we enter a new snow season, are there any programmes available to help national or local authorities react to excessive snowfall, such as funding for salt or even a coordinated salt-distribution scheme among Member States?
