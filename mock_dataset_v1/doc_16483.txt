WRITTEN QUESTION E-1128/08 by José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (5 March 2008) Subject: Multibanco — Charges for withdrawals It is being reported in Portugal that the Portuguese system for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) payments and transfers may cease to be free of charge from 2008. There is talk of banks charging EUR 1.5 for each withdrawal. This information has led to widespread anger. Withdrawals of this kind are an ingrained habit in Portuguese life, and the Multibanco system has always been free in Portugal. People have even started collecting signatures for a petition against this possible ‘banking innovation’, which would heavily penalise users and depositors. The latest information indicates that over 180000 people have signed, an unheard of figure for a petition in Portugal. 1. Is the Commission aware of the step referred to? 2. Can the Commission confirm the rumours that there are to be bank charges on ATM withdrawals? 3. If these rumours are true, does the Commission intend to take any steps to protect the rights of consumers, i.e. users and depositors who have never had to pay charges for using the Multibanco system in Portugal?
