WRITTEN QUESTION E-2279/05 by Gay Mitchell (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 June 2005) Subject: 0.7 % target for development aid The Commission has recently advocated an ‘interim’ target in 2010 of 0.5 % GNI to development aid for ‘old’ Member States, and 0.17 % for the 10 new Member States. The Irish Government is reported to be now setting a date of 2012 to meet the 0.7 % UN commitment. Does the Commission agree that targets are set to be met? If so, why does it encourage backsliding on a 30-year-old commitment by setting such low interim targets?
