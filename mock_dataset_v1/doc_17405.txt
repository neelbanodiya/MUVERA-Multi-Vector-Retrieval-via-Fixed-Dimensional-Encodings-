Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2008) From a public health point of view, the Commission has an interest in data on the quality, safety and efficacy of vaccines (pharmacovigilance) authorised in the EU as well as the vaccination coverage for a number of vaccines that are usually recommended as part of organised immunisation programmes. The Commission does not hold immunisation records from any of the Member States.
