of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management OJ C 139, 14.6.2006, p. 1. and of the Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 OJ L 406, 30.12.2006, p. 1. , the Fund may not exceed a maximum amount of EUR 500 million, drawn from any the margin under the global expenditure ceiling from the previous year, and / or from the cancelled commitment appropriations from the previous two years, excluding those related to Heading 1b. The appropriate amounts are entered into the budget as a provision as soon as the sufficient margins and/or cancelled commitments have been identified. As concerns the procedure, in order to activate the Fund the Commission, in case of a positive assessment of an application, presents to the budgetary authority a proposal for mobilisation of the Fund and, at the same time, a corresponding request for transfer. In parallel, a trilogue could be organised in order to find an agreement on the use of the Fund and the amounts required. The trilogue can take a simplified form. II.

It concerns 1650 redundancies (of which 825 targeted for assistance) in the enterprise LM Glasfiber operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 28 (Manufacture of machinery and equipment) in the Southern part of Denmark (Syddanmark), during the four-month reference period from 1 January to 30 April 2010. The application, case EGF/2010/022 DK/LM Glasfiber from Denmark, was submitted to the Commission on 7 July 2010 and supplemented by additional information up to 3 February 2011. It was based on the intervention criterion of Art. 2 (a) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 redundancies over a four-month period in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant in its suppliers and downstream producers and was submitted within the deadline of 10 weeks (Art. 5 of the Regulation). Commission's assessment was based on the evaluation of the link between
