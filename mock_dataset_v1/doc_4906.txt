Question for written answer P-010991/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Bogusław Sonik (PPE) (20 December 2010) Subject: Shale gas in Europe In his statements on the diversification of energy supply in the gas sector, Commissioner Oettinger has pointed out the need for the Member States to make use of shale gas reserves. In an interview with the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza on 30 November 2010, the Commissioner stated that he sees ‘shale gas as an enormous opportunity for Poland. It is also in the EU’s interests, because we do not want to depend on imports’. According to German press reports, drilling to locate shale gas reserves began in November 2010. Similar drilling was also carried out in Hungary in 2006, as well as in the Czech Republic. In the light of the above, could the Commission please answer the following questions: 1. Where in the European Union have shale gas deposits been found? Does the Commission have a general map of the location of shale gas deposits in the Member States, and in particular in Poland and Germany? 2. Is there any documented data showing how many cubic metres of shale gas have been extracted in Europe in general, and in particular in Poland and Germany, or in other Member States? 3. Which EU resources does the Commission think could be used to help fund the drilling and extraction of shale gas in the Member States?
