2004/C 33 E/219 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2102/03 by José Ribeiro e Castro (UEN) to the Commission (25 June 2003) Subject: CAP reform — Mediterranean produce Recently, on 3 June, at the close of the European Parliament's debate on the reform of the CAP, Mr Fischler (Commissioner) gave an undertaking that Mediterranean produce would soon be entitled to the same support as that for which other types of agricultural produce are eligible. This is a most interesting and important statement. The Commission: — would the Commission say what measures will flow from this granting of aid for Mediterranean produce? — when, how and in respect of which products does the Commission intend to implement this new policy?
