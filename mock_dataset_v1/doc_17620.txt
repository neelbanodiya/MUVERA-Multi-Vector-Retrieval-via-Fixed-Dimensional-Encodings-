European Schools In policy area 26 (Commission's administration), there is a separate budget line for each school and for the Board of Governors. THE DRAFT BUDGET (DB) 9. The Council completed its first reading and adopted the Draft Budget on 15 July. It has amended the PDB in four important ways: · Payment appropriations for operational expenditure have been cut throughout Heading 3. The Council says that it has followed the principle of limited and controlled growth of payment appropriations in comparison with 2005, taking into account the implementation rate in previous years. · Administrative expenditure has been cut throughout Heading 5. The Council says that it has applied a reduction of 2% on current expenditure, taking into account efficiency gains and the impact of inter-institutional co-operation. · Three information lines (16.02.02, 16.02.03 and 16.03.01) have been cut. As in previous years, the Council points to the fact that expenditure on these lines is not based on a multi-annual programme. · The Council has adopted essentially the same approach to pilot projects and preparatory actions , and cut appropriations for the 'pilot project in favour of citizenship' (15.06.01.09). 10. The appropriations entered in the Draft Budget for the European Schools reflect the budget for the schools agreed by the Board of Governors at its meeting on 25-27 April. These take account of the most up-to-date information available about foreseeable revenue and expenditure, on a school-by-school basis. DRAFTSMAN'S REMARKS 11. The budgetary procedure for 2006 unfolds against a bleak backdrop. The Lisbon process has stalled, the draft constitution has been rejected in France and Holland, and no agreement has been reached on a new Financial Perspective. Together, these developments have precipitated a crisis of belief in the European Union. We should therefore pay particular attention to programmes where 'European added-value' is uncontested (such as Erasmus) and to initiatives (such as town-twinning partnerships) which are concrete examples of European cooperation and which take place at a level which is close to citizens.
