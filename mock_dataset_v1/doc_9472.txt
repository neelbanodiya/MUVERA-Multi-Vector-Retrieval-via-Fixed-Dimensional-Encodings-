Question for written answer E-4163/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (11 June 2010) Subject: Violation of women's human rights in Namibia Three women from Namibia have lodged a complaint against their country’s health ministry, demanding compensation of 130000 dollars. They complain that they have been sterilised without their consent. The women had been diagnosed with the AIDS virus, but they claim that they did not agree to sterilisation. Usually, AIDS sufferers are advised to be sterilised, but in this specific case, the women complain that the doctors went ahead with the procedure without informing them. Women have held protest demonstrations in many African countries in support of the three women, and calling for women’s rights to be protected. Is the Commission aware of this situation? What steps can the Commission take to intervene with African institutions and courts, with a view to helping the victims of such barbaric practices?
