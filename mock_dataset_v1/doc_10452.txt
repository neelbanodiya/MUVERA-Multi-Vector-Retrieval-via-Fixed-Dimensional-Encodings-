Question for written answer E-010009/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (7 November 2011) Subject: Child pornography The loose-knit hacker network ‘Anonymous’ has recently succeeded in mounting a raid on a large child pornography ring in the United States. Data on the servers was deleted and the names of the child molesters were made public. The assumption has to be that there will be a similar attack on child pornography rings, which are increasingly active in the Internet, in the EU. 1. Does the Europe 2020 strategy, which lays great stress on child protection, contain further measures to combat online child pornography? 2. If not, why not? 3. If so, what are they?
