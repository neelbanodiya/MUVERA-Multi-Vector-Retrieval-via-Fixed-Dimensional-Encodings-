ORAL QUESTION H-0360/07 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Marc Tarabella to the Commission Subject: Health services On 20 April 2007, the Commission published the results of the consultation on health services it had launched in September 2006. As the majority of respondents were ‘in favour of Community action in the field of health’, can the Commission give an initial outline of the action it intends to take on the matter, in particular with a view to improving the provision of information to patients – making it possible for them to make informed choices – and ensuring greater clarity as regards the arrangements for and time limits in respect of obtaining healthcare in another Member State? What right of redress does the Commission intend to propose in cases in which national authorities refuse to grant prior authorisation?
