Question for written answer E-000438/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Morten Messerschmidt (EFD) (25 January 2012) Subject: Building regulations and Eurocodes Danish building regulations, which list a series of Eurocodes, can be downloaded from the Danish Business Authority’s website. The codes link to a corresponding number of national Danish application documents. There is, however, a general feeling that these Eurocodes are very complicated, to the extent of requiring a course in order to understand each of them. The available guidelines suggest signing up to expensive courses run by the Danish private company, Byggecentrum . Unlike before, however, it seems that the courses are more on how to obtain an overview of Eurocodes and their content, with the corresponding national application documents, than on learning to use them as tools within the discipline the user is qualified in. This is a problem which does not facilitate cooperation between Member States, where common rules should aim to facilitate trade across European borders. Does the Commission know how other Member States manage this complex issue and whether other Member States have experienced the same difficulties as in Denmark?
