by new structural commitments arising as payments are phased in for the 10 Member States that joined the Union in 2004. For EU 15, payment appropriations correspond to 95% of average year's commitments for objectives 1 and 2 and 90% for Community initiatives. These rates are the same as those of the 2005 PDB. Comparable rates of execution for mainstream projects in 2003 and 2004 were 78% and 88 % respectively whilst for initiatives they were 31% and 79%. Ø The cohesion fund The Cohesion Fund will see a significant increase in commitment funds of approximately 35% for the New Member States when compared with 2005. The increase derives from the Copenhagen Agreement. Other cohesion countries however, see a slight reduction in commitment appropriations. This is partly accounted for by Ireland's loss of eligibility in 2004. Ø Northern Ireland Peace programme Northern Ireland At the time of agreement on the 2005 Budget it was agreed that EUR 16 million would be re-allocated from the technical assistance and innovative actions envelope to the PEACE programme. The 2006 PDB proposes to allocate EUR 28 million to PEACE, the additional EUR 12 million coming from the technical assistance envelope. Source: DG Budget EC. Ø RAL RAL = All outstanding commitments which remain to be paid. once the conditions for payment have been fulfilled. , It should perhaps be emphasised that RAL is a normal consequence of multi-annual programmes. A comparison of the RAL as at 31/12/2003 and 31/12/2004 shows a correlation between the increase in objective 1 and cohesion RAL 6.8% and 42.2% respectively and the increase for new Member States Working Document Part III, PDB 2006, p. 243 . During the same period the RAL of the pre-2000 programmes was reduced from EUR 9.2 billion to EUR 3.3 billion. In 2006, if execution is in line with proposed payments, the outstanding RAL is expected to increase by 10% or approximately EUR 6 billion .This reflects the fact that proposed payments are less than 100% of 2006 commitments for EU 15 and are around 50% of 2006 commitments for the New Members States. The Commission's request for increases in the PDB 2006 is based on estimates of commitments and payments calculated on the one hand by reference to the Copenhagen Council figures and on the other by reference to 95% of average year's commitments. These objective criteria should ensure optimal management of resources.
