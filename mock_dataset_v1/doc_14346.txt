WRITTEN QUESTION E-6228/07 by Frank Vanhecke (NI) to the Council (12 December 2007) Subject: Call to ban pro-Kurdish party in Turkey Turkey's Chief Prosecutor has begun proceedings to ban the pro-Kurdish Democratic Society Party (DTP). Mr Abdurrahman Yalcinkaya said in his indictment, that ‘speeches and actions by party leaders have proved that the party has become a focal point of activities against the sovereignty of the state and indivisible unity of the country and the nation.’ (The Associated Press, ‘Turks move to ban pro-Kurdish party’, 16 November 2007). Talks are reported to have been held in November 2007 between the Turkish Foreign Minister and the EU troika. How does the Council view the abovementioned proceedings in the light of the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to freedom of expression and freedom of association? What consequences will these proceedings entail, in terms of the Council's response?
