and groundnut — fulfil many of the relevant criteria and have witnessed more rapid and widespread development in animal traction. Animal traction in these areas has been developing for over fifty years. The FAO estimates that over 15 % of farmers were already using animal traction in the late 1980s. Optimal use of this technology can increase yields by up to 50 %, thanks to improved soil preparation, water balance and plant nutrition — it should therefore continue to be promoted. The transport possibilities afforded by this technology considerably lighten the burden on women and children, particularly as regards transporting water and wood.
