Question for written answer E-5623/2010 to the Council Rule 117 Emilio Menéndez del Valle (S&D) (19 July 2010) Subject: Arbitrary behaviour by the Moroccan authorities The Moroccan authorities are pursuing an intolerable policy of harassment against Christians. In the past four months, 130 Christians from 12 different countries have been deported, including the Spanish woman Sara Domene. Many had been living in Morocco for decades working for NGOs or as teachers. Up until June 2010, 58 people from the USA had been deported. However, following the intervention of the US ambassador, US nationals were untouched by the most recent wave of expulsions, which targeted a Swiss woman and a Lebanese woman, both with Moroccan husbands. Morocco is accorded special treatment in its relations with the EU. Does the Commission intend to intervene, as the USA has done, to prevent such behaviour, which is clearly discriminatory, unfair and contrary to the European values that Rabat is purportedly keen to espouse?
