According to Article 53 of the Financial Regulation, the international organisation concerned shall apply accounting Audit and Control Procedures which offers guarantees equivalent to internationally accepted standards. When there is a claim towards the international organisation itself (for instance miscalculation of the amounts to be managed by this organisation or early termination of the financed project), it is up to the Commission to issue the Recovery Order against this organisation.
