Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2011) The Commission is not aware of the Italian experiment as such, but is aware of the huge potential of related labelling and contactless technologies. Technologies for electronic labels that can be read using a mobile phone, has been supported by the FP7 Research Framework Programme. There are many European projects in this field. The European project STOP (www.stop-project.eu) aims at developing ambient intelligence-based and network-oriented systems for the efficient and secure authentication of products. It thereby helps to reduce the problems imposed by counterfeiting and product privacy. Another project called ‘Farm to Fork’ (F2F) aims to showcase RFID technology to SMEs in the food & drink industry and to identify and trace food information along the supply chain. The project co-funded through the CIP ICT PSP programme. The contactless technologies could be very useful also in the field of energy savings and tracking real time energy consumption. In that regard labels which are machine-readable and whose content can be processed electronically can enhance their potential in the flow of value-adding information in the economy. All the projects that use RFID (radio frequency Identification technologies) and related technologies to identify objects, or make them Internet connectable, are invited to team up in the European Internet of Things Cluster (IERC, http://www.Internet-of-things-research.eu/). This IERC is open, also for non‑European projects, and has proven to be a good dissemination channel in Europe. However the Commission is not promoting the use of any specific technologies in support of its policies. Adoption of specific solutions is best left to the market.
