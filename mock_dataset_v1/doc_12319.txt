exposure at the workplace The Parliament and Council delegations to the Conciliation Committee have reached agreement on the directive on minimum health and safety requirements for noise exposure at the workplace. The EP delegation welcomes the compromise as it guarantees a significant improvement in protection for workers. It is now up to the two institutions to adopt the joint text formally. Parliament's rapporteur on the directive was Helle THORNING-SCHMIDT (PES, DK). The text of the agreement will appear on the webpage of Parliament's Conciliation Committee secretariat as soon as it is available: http://www.europarl.eu.int/code/backgrou/default_en.htm 23.10.2002 Press enquiries: Constanze Beckerhoff - tel.
