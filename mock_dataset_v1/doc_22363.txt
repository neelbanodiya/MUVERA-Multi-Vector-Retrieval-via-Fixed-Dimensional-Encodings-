Question for Question Time H-0352/2010 to the Commission Part-session: July 2010 Rule 116 David Martin (S&D) Subject: EU - Colombia Free Trade Agreement Following the signing of the EU - Colombia Free Trade Agreement last month in Madrid, can the Commission clarify when the Agreement is likely to come to Parliament under the consent procedure? Can the Commission confirm that a human rights clause has been agreed with Colombia, and also whether the text of this clause has been transmitted to Parliament? This human rights clause should include the provision to suspend the Agreement where human rights violations occur. Therefore, can the Commission detail the procedure for suspending the Agreement – i.e. is the Commission the sole initiator of any proposal to suspend the Agreement, and is a qualified majority or a unanimous decision needed by the Council to support any such proposal? Additionally, can the Commission outline what role Parliament and interested third parties such as trade unions will play in any proposal or decision to suspend the Agreement? Could the Commission also confirm whether national parliament ratification of the Agreement will be necessary and what the timetable and procedure would be in this case?
