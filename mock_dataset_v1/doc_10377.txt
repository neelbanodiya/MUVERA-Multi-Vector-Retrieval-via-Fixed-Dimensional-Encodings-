2004/C 58 E/122 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1892/03 by María Sornosa Martínez (PSE) to the Commission (6 June 2003) Subject: Failure to protect the Albufera de Valencia park The author of this question has repeatedly condemned the failure to protect the Albufera de Valencia park, which is a special protection area for birds (SPAB). Last month saw the expiry of the precautionary measures which the Valencia Regional Government laid down in April 2000 on a temporary basis, pending final approval of the park's management plan. However, approval of that plan is now eight years overdue. The Valencia Regional Government's Environment Ministry began drawing up the management plan in April 2000 and the period during which it was made available for public consultation ended last year. However, the regional government has yet to reply to the objections raised, nor has it published a final version of the management plan. In view of the fact that, in a judgment of 11 November 1999, the Supreme Court declared the Albufera Natural Park Special Protection Plan (the only specific planning and management tool applicable to the park) to be null and void, and given the threat currently posed by the damage being done to the park (which loses a certain number of species each year, whilst even greater numbers become endangered), is the Commission planning to make representations to the Spanish authorities with a view to ensuring that the Albufera SPAB is finally covered by a proper management plan which will protect its biodiversity? Does the Commission not think that the Valencia Regional Government should draw up a management plan before promoting any more urban developments which could seriously affect the park, such as the Pinedo housing estate, the Parador Nacional hotel, industrial growth around the park's protective boundary and the installation of extensive drainage (in the Barranco del Poyo, for example)? Can the Commission guarantee that the above urban developments will not be promoted without the requisite environmental assessment being carried out in each case?
