WRITTEN QUESTION P-0719/05 by Kathalijne Buitenweg (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (22 February 2005) Subject: Plucking of down from live geese in Hungary According to a broadcast of the Netherlands TV programme Keuringsdienst van Waarde on 26 October 2004, down is plucked from live geese in the EU Member State of Hungary. Naturally, this causes enormous suffering to the birds. Pictures demonstrating this, and additional information, may be found on: http://www.rvu.nl/kvw/index.php?i=8&r=30&n=329 The plucking of live geese contravenes Article 23(3) of Recommendation T-AP(95) 20 concerning geese adopted on 22 June 1999 by the Standing Committee of the European Convention for the Protection of Animals Kept for Farming Purposes. On 14 November 2001, MEP Torben Lund (PSE) already put a question ( P-3215/01 OJ C 134 E, 6.6.2002, p. 211 . ) to the Commission concerning similar practices in Poland, which at that time was a candidate country for accession. At the time, Commissioner Byrne replied that Poland had not ratified the Convention and as a consequence, for the moment was not bound by the same rules on geese farming as the Community and its Member States. In addition, he replied that in the Community the transposition of Directive 98/58/EC OJ L 221, 8.8.1998, p. 23 . enables the Member States to give effect to the recommendations adopted under the Convention. He stated that, furthermore, pursuant to Article 5 of the Directive the Commission must submit to the Council any proposals which may be necessary for the uniform application of the Convention. Commissioner Byrne also wrote that the Commission was not aware of cases of non-compliance with the Recommendation concerning geese within the Union, which would make specific Community legislation necessary to ensure its uniform application. 1. Is Hungary acting in contravention of Community legislation in this matter? If so, is the Commission prepared to take action in response? 2. If not, is the Commission prepared to draw up Community legislation to ensure uniform application of the Recommendation, now that it is aware of non-compliance? If not, how does the Commission intend to ensure uniform compliance with the Recommendation? 3. Has the Commission, pursuant to Article 5 of the Directive, meanwhile submitted to the Council proposals necessary for uniform application of the Convention? If not, why not?
