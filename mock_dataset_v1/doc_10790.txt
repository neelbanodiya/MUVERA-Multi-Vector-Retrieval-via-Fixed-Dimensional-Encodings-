Question for written answer E-002968/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Licia Ronzulli (PPE) (25 March 2011) Subject: Curing sleep disorders Insomnia is the world’s most common sleep disorder. Depending on the way in which it is defined, it affects between a third and a quarter of the world population. Approximately 10 % of the population suffer from a form of insomnia severe enough to require treatment. Yet in spite of all this, insomnia is hardly recognised by doctors and is therefore either underdiagnosed or else not properly treated. According to a study conducted by AIMS, the Italian Association of Sleep Medicine, in collaboration with general practitioners, 60 % of insomniacs have never talked to their doctor about their inability to sleep, a phenomenon which adversely affects the working lives of European citizens, since a person with insomnia is eight times more likely to have an accident at work than people who sleep normally. The failure to recognise and treat insomnia has considerable medical and social repercussions; in particular, it impairs the performance of European workers in their jobs and in general detracts from their quality of life. In 2008 the ‘Sleep and Health’ project, a publicity campaign organised in support of the first World Sleep Day, was launched in ten Member States. In the light of the foregoing, what practical steps will the Commission take to ascertain how the relevant directive has been transposed in the EU, bearing in mind that sleep disorders are damaging to both the physical and the mental health of European citizens? Will it carry out specific information campaigns aimed at all the Member States on the subject of sleep disorders, given that routine medical practice is such that these conditions often cannot be identified or treated in the appropriate way?
