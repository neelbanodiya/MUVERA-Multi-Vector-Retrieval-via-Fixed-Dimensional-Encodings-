Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (8 April 2010) In his complementary question regarding the situation of the Public Catalan Television (TV3) in the Valencian Autonomous Region, the Honourable Member cites new provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. Despite the changes introduced by these provisions, the elements of the Commission's answer to his previous Question E‑5389/09 remain valid http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E‑2009-5389+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN . It is true that the Treaty of Lisbon provides a more powerful tool to strengthen cohesion and the harmonious development of the European Union. However, in this concrete case, there are already detailed leges speciales in place, which also reflect the state of harmonisation in the scope of the various EU legal frameworks affecting the media. The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS) Directive 89/552/EEC of the Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive), OJ L 298, 17.10.1989, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC, OJ L 202, 30.7.1997 and Directive 2007/65/EC, OJ L 332, 18.12.2007. amending the TV without Frontiers Directive provides an obligation for the Member States not to restrict retransmissions originated in another Member State. In addition, Directives 2002/20/EC Directive 2002/20/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive), OJ L 108, 24.4.2002. and 2002/21/EC Directive 2002/21/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive), OJ L 108, 24.4.2002. enable the Member States to introduce a licensing system for the efficient management of their radio spectrum according to a set of harmonised principles governing their action. The Commission has competence for the overall integrity of this legal framework; concrete litigation remains, in the first place, a national matter. Moreover, it seems that there is no cross-border element in the situation of TV3 which would allow actions based on the EU freedoms of establishment and service. As to matters of culture, the Lisbon Treaty grants the European Union a role of support, coordination and complementary action but does not confer on it any competence to intervene instead of the Member States or to sanction them. As far as language is concerned, the Commission pursues a strategy to develop
