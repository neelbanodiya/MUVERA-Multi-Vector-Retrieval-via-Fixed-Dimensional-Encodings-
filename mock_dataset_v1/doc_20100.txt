their continued existence, given that the biological safety limits have been exceeded in recent years, as shown by the scarce recruitment observed from 1997 to the present – has demonstrated the unavoidable need to adopt measures to cut fishing mortality to levels compatible with sustainable fishing, since we will be facing a serious crisis unless extremely restrictive measures are taken on catches. In short, these circumstances have highlighted the fact that it is now vital to respect the precautionary principle when setting TACs, and that this is an indispensable measure if the desired aim is to be achieved, which is to guarantee sustainable fishing governed by the criterion of the conservation and rational management of resources. This must be based on the following points: - the catch possibilities allocated to the Community fleet must be based on the actual state of fish stocks as evidenced by the data provided by reliable scientific studies; - no fishing opportunities should be granted for new species and existing fishing opportunities for species covered by TACs should not be expanded unless there is a rational exploitation plan based on scientifically verifiable data; - catch possibilities must be based on the principle of sustainability, which means that the determining criterion must be the existence of sufficient spawning biomass of the species concerned, so that the medium- and long-term survival of stocks is guaranteed by the existence of satisfactory levels of spawning biomass; - the abundance of spawning biomass and measures to protect species and guarantee a good level of adult specimens may initially represent a burden and a severe limitation for the industry but will be highly beneficial in the long term because they will allow satisfactory catches of adults specimens, which are of higher market value. Application of the precautionary principle when setting TACs cannot be considered in isolation if it is to prove an effective conservation measure. Far-reaching changes must also be made to other key aspects of the common fisheries policy such as efforts to reduce the fleet, fisheries monitoring and action on discards. There is a general consensus on the part of both the Commission and the majority of the industry that plans to reduce the capacity of the over-sized Community fleet, chiefly structured around MAGPs, the fourth programme of which ends in 2001, have proved a failure. This was entirely foreseeable given the fact that they were poorly adjusted to
