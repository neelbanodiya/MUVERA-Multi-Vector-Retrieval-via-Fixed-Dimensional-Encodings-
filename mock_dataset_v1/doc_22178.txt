Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (8 September 2006) The Commission refers the Honourable Member to the joint reply given to Written Questions E‑2122/06 by Mr Meijer and Mrs Leotard, P‑2252/06 by Mrs Buitenweg and E‑2322/06 by Mrs Lienemann. Commissioner Kroes ceased all contacts with Mr Paarlberg, whom she had previously introduced to only a very limited number of third persons, in June 2004 (well before her nomination as a Member of the Commission) when she learnt that his name was cited in connection with possible illegal activities. At the same time, she requested that an end be put to the guarantee which the bank had required from Mr Paarlberg as the vendor of the two office buildings. Commissioner Kroes could not unilaterally put an end to this contractual agreement between two third parties, which however ceased upon the recent sale of the two office buildings. Commissioner Kroes’actions have been compatible with the Code of Conduct for Commissioners and with Article 213 of the Treaty, as well as being consistent with the specific commitments she undertook in the context of her hearing.
