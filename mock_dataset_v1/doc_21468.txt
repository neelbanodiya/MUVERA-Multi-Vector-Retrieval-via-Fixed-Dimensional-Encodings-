Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (7 February 2006) The Commission is aware that there are no specific procedures foreseen for humanitarian aid convoys in the Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) customs code. Although the Commission agrees that legitimate humanitarian aid trucks should smoothly pass the border, there is still a need to have a customs control system in place to avoid irregularities, which unfortunately have been experienced in the past, when humanitarian aid convoys were misused for the trafficking of weapons, drugs, fuel, cigarettes, etc. This is why BiH custom laws require that humanitarian aid trucks need to be accompanied by official customs documents and are to be sealed in the same way as every other truck crossing the border. In fact, there are no indications that the sealing of vehicles at departure is time-consuming or jeopardises the normal traffic flow at border crossing points. Non-sealed consignments would probably be subject to more thorough checks at the office of destination. The European Commission received information from the BiH Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA) that all vehicles have to pay a handling fee when they are declaring goods in a customs terminal. Even BiH authorities have to pay this fee. Trucks pay 30 Convertible Marks (Km) and small vehicles 10 Km. These fees are directly placed on ITA’s account and distributed through the single account to the state, entities and the Brcko District. The Commission does not consider that special conditions can be granted to A.R.P.A. The launch of the stabilisation and association agreement (SAA) negotiations with BiH requires that BiH show its ability to secure and control its external border against illicit trafficking and organised crime. The Delegation of the Commission to BiH is ready to meet representatives of A.R.P.A. in Sarajevo to discuss their difficulties and endeavour to find a workable solution to their problems.
