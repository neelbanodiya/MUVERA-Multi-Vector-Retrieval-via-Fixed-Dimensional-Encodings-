are met. State aid rules do not apply to advertising, including product labels, paid for entirely by the economic operators themselves without any public money. As far as the state aid rules are concerned, operators are free to indicate the origin of their products and production methods for instance on product labels or other in advertising as long as they bear the costs of the advertising themselves. Moreover, Article 113 a of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 OJ L 299, 16.11.2007. provides that the products of the fruit and vegetables sector which are intended to be sold fresh to the consumer, may only be marketed if the country of origin is indicated. Therefore in the case mentioned by the Honourable Member the consumer can already verify the origin of the product without additional indications or advertising.
