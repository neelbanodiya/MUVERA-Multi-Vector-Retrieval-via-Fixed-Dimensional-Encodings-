WRITTEN QUESTION E-2903/05 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (2 August 2005) Subject: Promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources Pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2001/77/EC OJ L 283, 27.10.2001, p. 33 . of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy, Member States were required to publish a report by 27 October 2003 on the evaluation of the legislative and regulatory framework concerning renewables. It was important that Member States did so in order to allow comparison of activity both over time and between Member States, therefore helping progress towards the 2010 targets. Could the Commission confirm that all Member States had reported by the date and if the reports have been published? Are there plans for regular follow-up reports to be published which would indicate what progress the individual Member States and the EU as a whole is making?
