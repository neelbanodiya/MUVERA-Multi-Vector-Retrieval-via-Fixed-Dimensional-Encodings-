Supplementary answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (8 July 2011) In the holding reply was mentioned that the Commission will complement the response as soon as possible with clarifications on the issue raised by the Honourable Member regarding the level of European funds absorbed by Siemens and its subsidiaries via tender/award procedures over the last 20 years. On this particular matter, the Commission invites the Honourable Member to consult the Financial Transparency System (FTS) (http://ec.europa.eu/beneficiaries/fts/index_en.htm), which includes information from 2007 on all beneficiaries of EU funds managed directly by the Commission and its executive agencies. Information regarding other management modes (decentralised, shared, and joint) can be found in the relevant management authority's website (http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/beneficiaries_en.htm). The information in FTS excludes the European Development Fund and staff related expenditures and it is available in the system at least six months after the payments have been made. For that reason, at this time, only data for 2009 financial year is available in FTS. Data for 2010 will be published at the end of the first semester 2011.
