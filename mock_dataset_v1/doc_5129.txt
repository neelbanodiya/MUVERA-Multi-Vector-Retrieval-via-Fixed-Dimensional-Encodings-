Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2012) According to our information, the decision by the Kyrgyz authorities to discontinue registration of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community has to be placed within the larger context of the adoption in the Kyrgyz Republic 2009 of a new Law on the Freedom of Beliefs and Religious Organisations, which stipulates a re-registration of all entities. It is to be noted that complaints with regards to the re-registration process have come from a wide range of religious organisations. During the last round of its Human Rights Dialogue with Kyrgyzstan in June 2011, the EU raised concerns regarding the new law on Religion, which would contradict the Constitutional guarantees on freedom of religion as well as international human rights standards. The Kyrgyz side informed that a working group to work out amendments to the law had been set up. The services of the High Representative/Vice-President are following closely the situation of religious minorities, including Ahmadiyya Muslims, throughout the country. The EU will continue to raise the issue with regard to freedom of religion in the bilateral contacts with the Kyrgyz authorities. The EU will continue to voice, in particular, in the framework of the next Human Rights Dialogue, concerns about reports of difficulties encountered by religious organisations with registration and will urge the authorities to adequately address the issue.
