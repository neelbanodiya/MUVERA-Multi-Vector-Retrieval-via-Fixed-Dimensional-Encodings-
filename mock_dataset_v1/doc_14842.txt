integrated financial markets, a crisis spilling over national jurisdictions cannot be tackled individually by national authorities; in this respect, considers that the current networks of national supervisors, the supervisory arrangements, and the non-legally binding memoranda of understanding may not be sufficient to face a major crisis caused by a failure of markets or important cross-border financial groups; considers that cooperation and mutual trust between supervisory authorities in a crisis event is crucial and urges the Commission and responsible national authorities to develop jointly appropriate proposals for effective crisis management for the further consideration of the Parliament; 35. Considers that the EU's authority in international negotiations, particularly as regards bank supervision, would be reinforced by the clarification of its internal functioning; 36. Notes that the question of the lender of last resort must be resolved in parallel to any further discussions about EU financial supervision; in this respect, stresses that a clear decision on responsibilities is necessary; 37. Notes that the current supervisory system leads to multiple reporting requirements for banks and that, therefore, an important task for all supervisory institutions is to converge the standards; 38. Believes that it is high time that the EU institutions, and particularly the Parliament, opened a debate on the structure of supervision of EU financial markets; for this reason, calls for the setting up, by the end of 2006, of a committee of "wise persons" to study - and report back six months after the establishment of the committee - the implications of the consolidation of markets and financial institutions, prudential supervision, financial stability, and crisis management; in this regard, asks the committee to propose concrete ideas regarding the simplification of multiple reporting requirements and the improvement of the current structures, and, ultimately, to reflect on the needs and structures of European financial supervisors; o o o 39. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
