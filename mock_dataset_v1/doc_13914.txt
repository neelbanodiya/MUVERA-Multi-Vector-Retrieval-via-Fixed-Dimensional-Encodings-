Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (6 October 2010) There is no link between progress in the accession negotiation and the Nabucco pipeline project. At the same time, the Commission is of course monitoring the progress on the Nabucco gas pipeline in its annual progress report on Turkey. Nabucco is well on track. The Commission has granted the EUR 200 million financial support under the European Energy Programme for Recovery. The most important steps on Nabucco should still be taken in 2010.
