ORAL QUESTION H-0854/07 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Silvia Ciornei to the Commission Subject: Emissions Trading Scheme after 2012 The Commission has announced a proposal for the Emissions Trading Scheme after 2012. EU-wide or national caps are discussed; certificates may be allocated by extended auctioning or with the help of benchmarking. The scheme has the potential strongly to influence the use of fuels in the EU and in the Member States, the security of EU energy supply and opportunities for investment, particularly in more efficient coal-fired power plants. By what means does the Commission intend to ensure that the Member States’ decisions on the structure of their energy mix are respected? How could the Emissions Trading Scheme be designed to contribute to the continuous modernisation of coal-fired power plants, as well as to the construction of highly efficient power plants until Carbon Capture and Storage is on the market after 2020?
