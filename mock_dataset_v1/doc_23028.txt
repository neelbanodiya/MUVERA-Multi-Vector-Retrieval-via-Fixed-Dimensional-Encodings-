The workshop will focus on the trade in ICT tools, its impact on human rights globally and the EU's position in the world. The workshop is the third in a series of workshops on internet freedom and the EU's foreign policy, and will be co-chaired by Ms Schaake (ALDE, Rapporteur on "A digital freedom strategy in the EU foreign policy" (AFET)) and Mr Leichtfried (S&D, former Rapporteur Dual-Use Regulations (INTA)). The workshop aims to get a clear picture of the importance of trade in ICTs in the EU's international trade relations and total exports and will also address the following questions: Which responsibility do governments and businesses have or share concerning the export of ICT tools? What lessons should be learnt from recent examples in which cases EU-based ICT companies have facilitated censorship and monitoring programs of repressive regimes? workshop internet security@European Institutions 20120206CAN37402 See the programme
