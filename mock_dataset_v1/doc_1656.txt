ORAL QUESTION H-0818/05 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Ģirts Kristovskis to the Commission Subject: Situation with regard to EU funding in Tunisia Is the Commission aware of the difficulties with EU funding in Tunisia? Tunisia is a target country of the EIDHR and one of the MEDA partners which receives significant financial assistance for economic/social actions, human rights and democracy development. The Commission is, no doubt, aware that the grants awarded by the EU to various NGOs, targeted in democracy-building and training projects, have been frozen by the Tunisian authorities without any proper explanation. No progress has since been observed in the release of EU funds. Parliament's Resolution on Tunisia of 29 September 2005 urges the Council and Commission to improve the management of projects under the MEDA programme and EIDHR and to work out the appropriate measures to be taken if no progress is observed in the release of blocked funds. What specific plans has the Commission drawn up, and what tangible steps have been taken to improve this situation? Does the Commission think that it should review the amount of financial grants to Tunisia (both under MEDA and EIDHR), bearing in mind that part of such funding has not reached its recipients and target?
