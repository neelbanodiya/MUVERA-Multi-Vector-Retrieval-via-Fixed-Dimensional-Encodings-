the Commission to provide Parliament with a detailed and up-to-date "donor matrix" for each country and region; 7. Requests the Commission to inform Parliament of how it is planning to ensure proper and effective consultation with all stakeholders at all stages of the programming process, in particular when it intends to introduce new activities; 8. Regrets that cross-cutting issues are not clearly mainstreamed in the strategy papers and indicative programmes and therefore urges the Commission to include them in a truly horizontal way in its annual action programmes and to provide clear mainstreaming benchmarks and/or impact indicators on the planned activities; 9. Urges the Commission strictly to apply the eligibility criteria for budget support, particularly refraining from such actions in countries where transparency in public spending cannot be assured; requests the Commission also to provide supplementary information to Parliament, particularly on how, in all countries benefiting from budget support, it is implementing the legal requirement under Article 25(1)(b) of the DCI to "support efforts of partner countries to develop parliamentary control and audit capacities"; 10. Calls on the Commission to send Parliament all information on the geographic and thematic programmes, along with the full list of the members of the DCI committee; requests the Commission to forward systematically and immediately to the members of the DCI committee all the conclusions of Parliament's scrutiny in their full versions; 11. Expects the Commission to address Parliament's concerns, expressed in the conclusions of its scrutiny of the Strategy Papers, and to fully implement Parliament's recommendations and requests in the annual action plans; 12. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States and the members of the DCI committee.
