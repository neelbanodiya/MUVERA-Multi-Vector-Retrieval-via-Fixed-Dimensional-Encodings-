Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (11 January 2007) As already indicated by the Commission in its answer to the Honourable Member's Oral Question H‑0670/06 during question time at Parliament's September 2006 session Written answer of 5.9.2006. , the Commission asked by letter dated 14 February 2006 for clarification from the Irish authorities on whether the findings of the European Court of Justice in Case C‑188/03 ( Junk v Kühnel ) had been incorporated into the relevant section of the Irish transposing legislation. As the Commission had not received any reply from the Irish authorities within the given deadline, the Commission sent a reminder on 2 August 2006. The Irish authorities replied by letter dated 31 August 2006 informing they were in the process of drafting legislation to amend the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to cover a number of matters, including the Junk v Kühnel case. The Commission asked the Irish authorities by letter dated 27 September 2006 to inform it about progress on the proposed legislation and to provide a calendar for adoption. The Irish authorities replied by letter of 10 October 2006 that it was hoped to have the draft legislation amending the Protection of Employment Act 1977 published by the end of 2006. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation closely and will act according to its responsibilities laid down in the Treaties, should the Irish authorities fail to comply with the findings of the European Court of Justice in Case C‑188/03 ( Junk v Kühnel ).
