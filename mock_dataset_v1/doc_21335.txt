the quality and performance of education and training systems, Strengthen governance and raise ambitions in pursuing the Europe 2020 goals 1. Considers that, in the light of the Commission's proposal to retain the employment policy guidelines adopted in 2010 for 2011, the recommendations on the National Reform Programmes have become the main macroeconomic surveillance and orientation tool; deplores the failure to involve Parliament in this process and the lack of debate concerning it; 2. Considers that the major challenges faced by the EU and the Member States with regard to employment and unemployment should also be duly reflected in the future process on macroeconomic imbalances, within the policy framework of the European employment guidelines; 3. Considers that the Annual Growth Survey and the framework provided by the European Semester are crucial tools for the enhanced coordination of economic policies and, therefore, an important part of the Union's response to the crisis; notes, however, that these tools should be employed in a manner consistent with the need for democratic processes and support, and not serve to replace or diminish the importance of the existing tools provided for under the Treaty, in particular the broad economic policy guidelines and the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, with which Parliament must be closely involved and, on the latter, consulted; calls for these tools to be integrated into the framework of the European Semester and for particular attention to be paid to ensuring that their importance does not diminish, with a view to delivering on the Commission and Council's stated objective of increasing ownership and democratic accountability; 4. Calls on the Council and the Commission, when providing policy advice to Member States, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and social dialogue in the field of wages and pensions as well and, in keeping with Article 153(5) TFEU, to respect the competences of the Member States and social partners, in accordance with national practices, in these areas; 5. Urges the European Council, the Council and the Commission to ensure that the Europe 2020 strategy and the strengthened European economic governance system are effective and democratically legitimate; emphasises that this makes the genuine and timely involvement of Parliament throughout the surveillance and policy coordination procedures essential; deplores the lack of a reference to Parliament's role in the process in the timeline proposed in the Annual Growth Survey; 6. Calls on the Member States
