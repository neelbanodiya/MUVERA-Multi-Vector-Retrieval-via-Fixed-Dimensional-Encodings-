Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (26 November 2010) Minimum requirements for fitness to drive are laid down in Annex III of Council Directive 91/439/EEC on driving licences OJ L 234, 24.8.1991. . According to requirements that were applicable until recently, truck drivers requiring insulin treatment were not allowed to continue driving. The requirements concerning fitness to drive for applicants or drivers who have diabetes mellitus have been recently adapted to scientific and technical progress. Annex III of the driving licence directive has been amended by Commission Directive 2009/112/EEC OJ L 223, 26.8.2009. , which had to be transposed by Member States by 25 October 2010. Since then, Member States have to apply the new requirements of this directive. It allows HGV (trucks) or PSV (buses) drivers, who are suffering from diabetes mellitus and who are requiring insulin treatment, to continue to drive under certain conditions. This may also imply that previously withdrawn licences will be returned.
