ORAL QUESTION H-0401/02 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Paulo Casaca to the Commission Subject: Creation of European sugar-refining cartel with Community support Article 81(1) of the Treaty prohibits cartels at European level, notably those having as their object the restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. However, as the Court of Auditors' special report No 20/2000, paragraph 91, points out, there is no true common market in the sugar sector, and competition between the various sugar-refining enterprises does not exist. The suspicions raised by the Court of Auditors concerning the creation of an industry cartel with the endorsement of the European institutions are fully confirmed by the movements, or non-movements at international level, within the sugar and cane trade and by sugar prices on the European market. The Commission's ban on the sending of sugar consignments to the EU by refineries which do not have agreements with the European cartel amounts to a substantial reinforcement of this cartel's power. Can the Commission explain why its services responsible for competition have still not launched any kind of investigation - whether within the Commission or externally - into the European sugar cartel's long-standing and visible practices of dividing up the markets, price-fixing, and dumping on to territories where no controls apply? Does the Commission not consider its own failure to act to be clearly in breach of the Treaty?
