Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (23 December 2005) The Honourable Member is aware that the provisions of Article 6(4) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora apply when the results of the preliminary assessment under Article 6(3) are negative or uncertain. Therefore, the first step to be taken by the competent authorities is to examine the possibility of resorting to alternative solutions which better respect the integrity of the site in question. Such solutions are normally identified within the framework of the initial assessment carried out under Article 6(3). It rests with the competent national authorities to assess alternative solutions against the site’s conservation objectives. The Commission has thoroughly considered the assessment carried out by the Spanish authorities, which concluded that there was no alternative to the construction of the Granadilla Port, as well as comments and information from other sources. Further to the statement made by the Spanish authorities regarding the need to develop the project for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and the request to the Commission to deliver an Opinion pursuant to Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, the Commission is currently assessing the case. No decision has yet been taken by the Commission.
