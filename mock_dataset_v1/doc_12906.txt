WRITTEN QUESTION P-5626/07 by José Ribeiro e Castro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (9 November 2007) Subject: Portuguese IRS code — discrimination against married or widowed parents The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code in Portugal heavily penalises parents who are married or widowed with regard to the taxes imposed on them, since it does not allow them to deduct the sum of EUR 6 500 per child from their income, whilst parents with any other personal or civil status may do so through maintenance payments. The existence of this discrimination, and the injustice it represents, were publicly acknowledged by the Finance Minister in the programme ‘Prós e Contras’ broadcast by RTP‑1 on 6 November 2006. The draft state budget for 2008 upholds this differentiated regime, although it is proposed that the ceiling be lowered to EUR 6 000 in line with the constant tax increases being imposed by the current socialist government. This clearly discriminatory legal framework may constitute a violation of the Constitution of the Portuguese Republic. It may also constitute a violation of the principles of Community law, given the requirement to combat all forms of discrimination in the European Union. These fundamental principles include, in particular, the precepts of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which enshrine equality and non-discrimination, as well as, in this specific case, the rule laying down that ‘the family shall enjoy legal, economic and social protection’. — Can the Commission open an investigation into this tax discrimination against married and widowed parents? — Does the Commission believe that this clear case of tax discrimination in Portugal may be in breach of rules or principles of Community law, either within the current legal framework, or above all within the framework that will result from the entry into force of the new Reform Treaty recently adopted in the IGC?
