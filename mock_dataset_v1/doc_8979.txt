Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (30 November 2005) Following the Commission’s answer to the Honourable Member’s previous Written Question E‑3222/05 , the Commission cannot but repeat that clarifications on statements made and expressions used by members of the Greek Government should be requested from the Greek Government. In relation to the Greek third Community support framework (CSF), the Commission has always acted within the framework of the rules and regulations applicable to the third CSF, which are the only relevant points of reference. Its statements are in full conformity with this. Members of the Greek Government are of course free to agree or disagree with any Commission statements.
