ECON Fiscal fraud Fiscal fraud and tax evasion represents more than 2% of the EU GDP. It is not only a major economic issue, but it is clearly a social issue too, since it translates into a reduction in investments and public spending. The ECON Committee has repeatedly drawn the attention to this shortfall in public revenue and has urged in its reports the Commission and the member States to take further action to combat tax fraud on all fronts. 20090511CAN55633
