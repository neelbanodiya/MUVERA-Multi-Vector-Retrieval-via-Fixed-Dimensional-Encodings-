WRITTEN QUESTION E-4321/08 by Jorgo Chatzimarkakis (ALDE) to the Commission (28 July 2008) Subject: Parallel trade in medicines Can the Commission state its position on parallel trade in medicines and its role in the area of patient safety? Why has DG Enterprise, in its recent consultations, focused on intra-Community trade when almost all counterfeit medicines come from outside Europe, and the vast majority of previous incidents have occurred in the originators’ direct supply chain, not the parallel import supply chain? Does the Commission possess any conclusive evidence in support of allegations that parallel trade in medicines harms patient safety or that it facilitates the entry of counterfeit medicines into the legal supply chain? If so, can the Commission share this evidence in writing with MEPs? From what I have heard, the governments and medicine regulatory agencies of all major parallel importing markets — including Germany, the UK, Sweden, Denmark and Poland — support and encourage parallel imports and consider them a safe and reliable part of the European supply chain. Will the Commission take their views into account when drawing up legislative proposals in the area of patient safety?
