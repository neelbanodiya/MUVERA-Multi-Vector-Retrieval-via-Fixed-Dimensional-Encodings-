As freedom of movement is restricted for EU citizens with disabilities because of inconsistent access and services, what specific action can be taken to ensure that citizens with disabilities are not discriminated against, and that they enjoy equal treatment in the areas of social protection, including social security, healthcare, education and access to the range of goods and services commercially available to the public? What action can be taken in the context of the EU 2020 Strategy to increase equality in the EU?
