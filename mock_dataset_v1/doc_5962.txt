Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (8 February 2006) The Commission wishes to recall that water charging is at the discretion of the Member States, provided that the general conditions laid down by the Water Framework Directive Directive 2000/60/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. , Article 9, are respected. In particular, Article 9 paragraph 1 states that Member States shall take into account the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, in accordance in particular with the polluter pays principle. Member States shall ensure, by 2010, that water-pricing policies provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and an adequate contribution of the different water uses to the recovery of the costs of water services. In doing so, Member States should have regard to the social, environmental and economic effects of the recovery, as well as the geographic and climatic conditions of the regions affected. Article 9 paragraph 4 offers the possibility for Member States to breach this general provision provided this does not compromise the purposes and the achievement of the directive and the reasons are reported in the river basin management plans.
