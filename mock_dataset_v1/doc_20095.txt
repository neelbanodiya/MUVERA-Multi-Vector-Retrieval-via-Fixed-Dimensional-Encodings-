put forward a comprehensive and workable plan to solve the problem of discards; 10. Urges the Commission and the Council to study the effect which industrial fishing for the purposes of fishmeal production (which these days absorbs one-third of the fish caught in Community waters) has on fisheries resources and, in doing so, to apply the precautionary principle right from the start; 11. Stresses that, with regard to the setting of multiannual TACs, it would be sensible to make the required mechanisms flexible so that they can be adjusted when necessary; they should be established for the purpose of achieving certain targets within a given period of time and should not serve solely to impose a ceiling on catches; 12. Is of the opinion that when fish of species for which TACs have been set are discarded at sea, the quantities discarded should be counted against quotas; 13. Takes the view that the Commission and Council must make provision for additional socio-economic measures to support the sector in order to compensate fisheries workers whose professional activity is significantly curtailed as a consequence of the cuts in catches which will have to be made owing to the unforeseeable decline in stocks; such support must be available on an equitable basis throughout the EU and in addition to financial structural measures for compensation and regeneration, there must be effective and practical measures to facilitate diversification; 14. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission. EXPLANATORY STATEMENT One of the key issues in analysing the future of Community fisheries policy is the definition of mechanisms to set catches in accordance with criteria which will ensure the rational exploitation of existing fishery resources, thus guaranteeing the conservation of marine species at optimum population levels. Up to now, resource-conservation policy within the Community has hinged on the end-of-year setting of an annual TAC covering most commercial species and the adoption of a series of technical measures aimed at favouring the viability of the youngest specimens so as to allow them to reach maturity and thus secure the necessary renewal of stocks. The precautionary principle basically means that possible catches of fish species should be set at a level which will amply guarantee the conservation of the species in the medium and long term, securing an adequate level of specimens of breeding age which will allow the necessary renewal of biological cycles,
