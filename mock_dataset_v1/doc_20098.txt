Community fisheries policy. Before considering the matter further, it might be appropriate to outline the way in which total allowable catches (TACs) are currently set. The decision on this crucial matter is taken by the Council of Ministers, which meets each December to decide on the maximum catches applicable to the vast majority of commercial species of fish. The annual nature of the measure and the fact that it is decided in December, meaning that it applies for a period which starts only a matter of days after the decision is taken, is one of the industry's most telling criticisms, since it obliges them to adapt their professional activity, in an extremely short time, to circumstances which may entail a huge variation caused by unforeseeable factors such as uncertainty regarding the state of stocks, changes in fishing areas, the introduction of restrictions in certain fisheries, etc., which are likely to ruin any kind of rational economic planning. In principle, the decision of the Council of Ministers is based on work carried out in advance throughout the year, the main basis of which should be (and we use the words 'should be' advisedly, because it is not the case) the scientific reports drawn up by accredited bodies, chiefly the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Commission's own Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF), as well as scientific bodies in countries which have fishing interests in cooperation with the European Union, particularly Iceland and Norway. The data provided by scientists and the recommendations made by them would in themselves, if they were respected, incorporate a philosophy in keeping with the precautionary principle in setting TACs. What happens is that these recommendations are not generally followed when a final decision is taken by the decision-making body, i.e. the Council of Ministers, since the figures suggested by scientists are generally added to quite significantly in order to take account of the socio-economic circumstances involved and pressures stemming from the interests of certain Member States. This sometimes leads to surprising results, since the TAC set for a species is frequently far higher than the actual level of catches, which unfortunately tally with the actual state of stocks, which are scarce. In fact, the upshot of this tendency for TACs to be set at higher levels than those recommended on the basis of scientific data and which do not
