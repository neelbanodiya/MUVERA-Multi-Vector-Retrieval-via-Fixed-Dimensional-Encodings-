Question for written answer E-001548/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Inês Cristina Zuber (GUE/NGL) (9 February 2012) Subject: Threatened redundancies at the Cabelte Group I have learned that the Cabelte Group, a company with industrial units in the north of Portugal, will not be renewing fixed-term employment contracts of workers in its Arcozelo plant in Vila Nova de Gaia. This measure affects about 25 workers and the company is pressurising workers on fixed-term contracts to end them by mutual agreement. This company has received approximately EUR 2.8 million in state aid from Portugal, under the COMPETE programme, and is carrying out a policy of redundancies in a region already badly affected by the scourge of unemployment and even taking the opportunity to evade its social obligations. 1. Has this company received any kind of Community aid? For what purpose was the aid allocated and what undertakings were made when it was received? 2. Taking account of the serious social and economic problems in Portugal, particularly in the North, where unemployment is continuing to rise, what measures will the Commission take?
