Question for written answer E-005867/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Ramon Tremosa i Balcells (ALDE) (16 June 2011) Subject: Catalan farmers affected by the ‘cucumber crisis’ The so-called ‘cucumber crisis’ started in Germany at the end of May 2011 apparently as a result of an outbreak of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection and statements made by the German authorities alleging that Spanish produce was at the source of the outbreak, which resulted in a number of deaths. Fears that the bacteria could have come from Spain led to the almost total paralysation of horticultural exports from Spain to central Europe, Russia and, to a lesser extent, the United Kingdom. Export contracts for most vegetables and even some summer fruits have been cancelled. In addition, trucks which had already reached their destination have been turned back. The German Secretary of State for Agriculture, Robert Kloos, was reported by Reuters to have said while at a meeting in Hungary of EU agriculture ministers that ‘Germany recognises that the Spanish cucumbers are not the cause’. The Catalan Government has said that the Catalan horticultural sector is losing EUR 200 million a week. In light of the above: Does the Commission consider that the German authorities have acted irresponsibly? Does the Commission consider that the EU should carry out an in-depth investigation into these events in order to better manage future food crises? Does the Commission consider that the affected producers should be directly compensated? Does the Commission consider that the EU should pay for a European publicity campaign in support of Catalan and Spanish products to restore their good reputation following the ‘cucumber crisis’?
