WRITTEN QUESTION E-2076/05 by Bart Staes (Verts/ALE) to the Council (7 June 2005) Subject: Situation of Chechen refugees in Georgia In Georgia, Chechen refugees recently went on hunger strike in protest against the way in which they are being treated. They are particularly complaining about a lack of respect on the part of UNHCR Georgia, which is reflected in relatively poor reception facilities and above all in the virtual impossibility of leaving Georgia under a programme which was set up on account of the country's poverty-stricken condition. In this programme, priority is evidently given to non-Chechens. Is the Council aware of the situation of Chechen refugees in Georgia, which is said to involve denial of basic assistance? Is the Council aware of abuses which allegedly take the form of according non-Chechens more favourable treatment than Chechen refugees when it comes to being able to leave Georgia? Will the Council contact the Georgian authorities through diplomatic channels in an effort to persuade them to place the organisation of the reception of Chechen refugees in Georgia on as satisfactory a footing as possible? Will it also urge the Georgian authorities to cease to levy import duty on humanitarian aid supplies?
