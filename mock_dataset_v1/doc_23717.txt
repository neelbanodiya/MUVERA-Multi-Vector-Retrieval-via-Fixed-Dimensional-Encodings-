of finance and central banks of present and future euro members to help spread good practice. The report calls on the Commission to draw up reports on best practices and encourage national, regional and local authorities to establish local reporting centres where anyone can report any abuse, such as unwarranted price increases. Parliament also asks the Commission to analyse the excess of €500 notes in circulation, warning of the risks associated with such a high value note with regard to money laundering and crime. It queries the relevance of keeping such notes, given the rise in electronic trading in transactions.

From now on, three phthalates - DEHP, DBP and BBP - are totally banned for use in any toys or childcare articles where their concentration exceeds 0.1% by mass of the plasticised material. Before 1999, concentrations of up to 30% sometimes occurred. The three other phthalates - DINP, DIDP and DNOP - are banned, for the same concentrations, in toys and childcare articles which children could put in their mouths whether or not they are intended for this use. The ban also applies irrespective of the age categories. Besides toys and childcare articles, Parliament also calls on the Commission to look at other types of material containing these
