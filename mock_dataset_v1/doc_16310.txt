Question for written answer E-8565/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (20 October 2010) Subject: Mussel farming Is the Commission aware that in the period 1999-2000 the then Irish Minister for the Marine granted a tranche of licences, against all advice and in spite of a spate of objections, for additional mussel farming in Killary Harbour, thereby making the livelihoods of the original members of Killary Fish Farmers Cooperative which was founded in 1980, non-viable as well as threatening the existence of mussel farming in Killary Bay. Is it aware that in 1992 the Department of Marine in Ireland started issuing licences for larger sites despite the evidence that was emerging of slowing growth rates in areas of dense activity? Is it aware that the additional licences were issued for mussel farming sites almost contiguous with salmon farming sites in the Bay, even though it is internationally accepted that a minimum of 1 000 metres should separate finfish from shellfish sites?
