assessment of the debate on the European Union ( 2005/2146(INI) ) Draftsman: Jean-Marie Cavada SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs calls on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Points to the many improvements that the Constitution makes to the existing Treaties as regards security, freedom, and justice, including for example: doing away with organisation according to ‘pillars’, thus enabling most of the procedures encompassed within the present third pillar to be brought within the Community system; the wider use to be made of decision-taking by qualified majority vote and the simplification of legislative acts; the wider-ranging jurisdiction to be conferred on the Court of Justice; the stronger role for Parliament in the joint exercise of legislative authority; placing Europol within a Community framework, as opposed to its present status within the intergovernmental sphere, which makes for no better than very poor democratic control; incorporation of the Charter of fundamental rights in the actual text of the Constitution, thereby enabling it to rank as law; the proposed accession of the Union to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; increased powers for Eurojust; the prospect of setting up a European public prosecutor’s office; and a stronger role for the national parliaments and the European Parliament as far as assessment is concerned; 2. Emphasises the strategic importance of Parliament in the public debate on the Constitution and the need for forms of communication to be developed which will engage the general public; 3. Stresses that the debate must be a large-scale one cutting across institutions, social partners, political parties and the media, and that it must be supported by means of maximum publicity (including publicity provided by the institutions); stresses that the European freedom, security and justice project must be central to such a debate; 4. Welcomes the fact that, on 17 and 18 October 2005, the European Parliament and the national parliaments held a meeting given over to judicial and police cooperation in Europe; notes that the meeting showed that there is a consensus on the many new features which the Constitution adds in this field, as well as on the need for all the parliaments of the Union to work together more actively, in particular to enhance democratic control over, and the effectiveness of, Europol and
