concern regarding the Commission's recent proposal to completely abolish the intervention system in respect of maize from 2007; notes that the way the proposal was presented is contrary to the fundamental principles of the EU given the timing, the lack of a proper evaluation – especially as regards implications for the common organisation of the market in cereals and the area-based direct payments – and the lack of alternatives or transitional periods; is of the opinion that premature abolition of the maize intervention system would probably have serious consequences; 28. Believes that, in the spirit of the 2003 CAP reform, the introduction of area payments for soft fruit produced for processing should be considered along with the possibility of making them conditional on compulsory membership of food-processing groups or producers" organisations and the requirement to sell products under commercial contracts, which could contribute to increasing competitiveness in the soft fruit sector and improving the situation for growers in Member States, in particular Poland; 29. Considers that further changes are necessary in the agricultural production and rural fabric of the new Member States and emphasises that CAP rules and Community aid have to assist this procedure; stresses that it is crucial to effect these necessary changes in a cushioned way, as the agriculture-bound rural society and economy of the new Member States could not tolerate too rapid and drastic changes in their production and employment structure; Future of the CAP in the enlarged EU 30. Points out that the present CAP is unsuitable to manage a substantial part of agricultural and agriculture-related problems in the enlarged EU; considers that the decoupling of the direct payments, forced by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), increases in general the market orientation of European agriculture but that decoupled direct payments do not contribute fully to the establishment of a sustainable agricultural sector and rural society, either in the new Member States or in a considerable part of the EU-15; points out that either additional measures or tailor-made application of the direct payments are necessary; 31. Takes the view that, especially in Member States and regions where specialised farms play a decisive role in the agriculture, the present system of direct payments promotes arable cropping too significantly, does not assist properly the establishment of sustainable animal husbandry and does not promote and facilitate the necessary structural changes; 32. Notes that, in the case of some new
