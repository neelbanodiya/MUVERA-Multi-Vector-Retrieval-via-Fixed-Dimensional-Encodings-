Italy, 22 of the 24 ESF‑OPs have a general priority on social inclusion with a total budget of EUR 597.2 million. Although not directly targeting Roma, the projects to be financed under this priority will indirectly benefit Roma. Similarly, projects under other priorities of the OPs may also benefit Roma. At the same time, the Commission continues to urge Member States to make use of the Structural Funds, and in particular the ESF, to promote the inclusion of Roma, as recently underlined in the conclusions of the European Council of December 2007.
