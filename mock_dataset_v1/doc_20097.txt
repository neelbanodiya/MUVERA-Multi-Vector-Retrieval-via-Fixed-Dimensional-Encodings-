were recommending, the aim being to cushion the negative socio-economic impact of a decision taken in line with what should have been considered advisable in the light of the scientific data. There is a broad tradition of applying the precautionary principle in relation to the exploitation of natural resources and conservation of species in international law, and it was a significant topic for debate in the course of Agenda 21 of the United Nations Conference on the Environment and Development, in the drawing-up of the FAO Code of Conduct on responsible fishing and at the United Nations Conference on straddling and highly migratory stocks held in New York in July 1993, which is legally enshrined in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Concern at the application of the precautionary principle in the conservation of existing marine resources is directly linked to the development of the fishing industry in the 1970s and 1980s, when a general policy of subsidies for the construction of vessels was applied by virtually all major fishing nations, leading to the expansion of the fleet and a consequent exponential increase in fishing effort. By the end of the 1980s there had been a fourfold increase in average catches by comparison with the previous decades. In the following years, this plundering of fish led to a sharp drop in catches for fishing fleets throughout the world as a consequence of the high mortality rate over those years in virtually all commercial species, particularly Atlantic cod and some widely consumed pelagic species such as sardines and anchovies. Paradoxically, the drastic fall in catches arising from the decline in stocks led to an increase in fishing effort, since the fleet was obliged to fish more to obtain similar yields and thus be in a position to cope with the high level of investment which had been incurred in a fleet which was clearly oversized by comparison with the available resources. This vicious circle, in which the European Union also played its part, is at the origin of many of the most far-reaching problems now facing Community fisheries policy. Before considering the matter further, it might be appropriate to outline the way in which total allowable catches (TACs) are currently set. The decision on this crucial matter is taken by the Council of Ministers, which meets each December to decide on the maximum catches applicable to
