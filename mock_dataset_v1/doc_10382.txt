Question for written answer E-010243/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (9 December 2010) Subject: European Financial Transaction Tax A recent report by the Greens/EFA in the European Parliament http://www.greens-efa.org/cms/default/dokbin/354/354830.financial_transaction_tax_paper@en.pdf indicates that the introduction of a financial transaction tax in the European Union or eurozone would help stabilise the financial system and avert systemic risks, while generating a substantial revenue of between EUR 80 billion and EUR 190 billion annually, or thereabouts. This revenue could play a major role in protecting savings and banks without the need for painful cuts in vital welfare expenditure and in funding the increased investment urgently necessary for a greener economy, with a view to emerging from the economic social and environmental crisis at the same time. In view of this: 1. Is the Commission aware of this report? 2. What actions will it take to promote this measure? 3. In addition to measures to promote the adoption of such a tax, will it also make specific recommendations regarding the use of the revenue thereby generated?
