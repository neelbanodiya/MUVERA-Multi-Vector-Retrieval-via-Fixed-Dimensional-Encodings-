Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) The Commission notes the passage of the non-binding amendment to aviation legislation criticising the inclusion of the aviation by US Congress in early February 2012. The Commission recognises and takes very seriously the concerns about the inclusion of aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) expressed by some third countries, and is engaging actively in discussions both bilaterally and in ICAO in order to address these concerns. At the same time it notes that it is now widely recognised, that the EU legislation has increased the momentum and pressure for global action addressing international aviation emissions to be agreed as soon as possible. The extent to which airlines reflect their carbon costs in their ticket prices is their decision and not regulated by the EU ETS. This said, the Commission believes it is consistent with the polluter-pays-principle that passengers bear the costs of the pollution associated with their flights The EU ETS is a non‑discriminatory system that includes all flights into and out of European airports by all airlines, thereby avoiding any market distortions. The legislation applies equally to EU and non‑EU airlines active in the EU market. The law will not have significant economic impact on the sector or on the economy as a whole. The majority of the emission allowances for aviation will be distributed to the aircraft operators free of charge. The additional costs per flight are therefore low.
