WRITTEN QUESTION E-6412/08 by Georgios Georgiou (IND/DEM) to the Commission (28 November 2008) Subject: Property registration fees in Greece Since Commissioner Hübner failed to reply fully to my Written Question E‑5258/08 I am obliged to repeat my query. Is it acceptable for a registration fee to be levied more than once for the same property, which is naturally registered only once and not the same number of times as the number of people who have rights to that property?
