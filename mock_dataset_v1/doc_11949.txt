WRITTEN QUESTION E-4086/07 by Andreas Mölzer (ITS) to the Commission (3 August 2007) Subject: Pesticide contamination Fruit and vegetables, whether imported from other parts of the EU or grown domestically in Member States, are often heavily contaminated with pesticides. By way of an example, consumer protection organisations recently established that Austrian strawberries contain up to seven different kinds of pesticides. Although the spot checks performed on domestic products revealed no breaches of the limit values, no proper research has yet been carried out into the interactions between the individual substances contained in the many products used simultaneously by growers. The result is that consumers — probably quite rightly — suspect that wily agricultural producers are seeking to circumvent statutory limit values by employing a combination of authorised plant protection products. 1. What information does the Commission have about this problem and have steps been taken to investigate any suspected wrongdoing? 2. Have studies been carried out into the interaction between combinations of different plant protection products? If so, what are their findings, and if not, are such studies planned? 3. Are there any rules governing combinations of different plant protection products, or, in the light of the use of such combinations, are there plans to lay down new limit values?
