Question for written answer E-4356/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Stavrakakis (S&D) (16 June 2010) Subject: Evaluation of the 112 emergency service telephone number In its draft answer of 31 May 2010 to Written Question E‑2332/10, the Commission did not answer the second part of the question concerning the infringement of certain principles contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (rights to life, integrity of the person, safety and health protection) owing to the unsatisfactory quality of the emergency services provided via the 112 number. Does the Commission consider that the reference to a recommendation concerning undesirable circumstances relating to infection control in the hospital sector and primary healthcare covers the highly important question of ambulances arriving late or not at all in the event of an accident?
