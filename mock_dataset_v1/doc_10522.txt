strategy for Lesotho and to foresee a new focal sector on measures to fight against HIV/AIDS with a financial allocation of € 8 million. Details of this project are being worked out. In addition, the Global Fund has approved a global project of USD 29,312,000 for Lesotho. This project was initiated in December 2003 with a budget of USD 10.5 million for the first two years. The Community is a major contributor of the Global Fund, with a contribution reaching 15% of the total budget. Finally, the Commission's humanitarian aid department (ECHO) provides supplementary feeding to extremely vulnerable households headed by a chronically sick person or orphaned. ECHO has already funded two such programmes in Lesotho, now completed, and is currently funding a third via the German Red Cross for a total amount of € 700,000. This project is implemented in close coordination with a € 700,000 project from the Community’s budget line on co-financing on integrated Community based care for people living with HIV/AIDS or terminal illnesses and orphans implemented by the same organisation.
