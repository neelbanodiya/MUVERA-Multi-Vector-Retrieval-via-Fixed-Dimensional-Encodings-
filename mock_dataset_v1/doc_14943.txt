Recalls that the main objective of the newly established surveillance mechanism is the prevention and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the European Union and, in particular, in the eurozone; recalls that, in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011, further objectives of the new mechanism include sustained convergence of economic performances of the Member States and closer coordination of economic policies; 2. Stresses that, in the light of the current economic situation, it is essential for the macroeconomic surveillance framework to be up and running as soon as possible; 3. Believes that potential spillover effects of Member State and Union policies should be identified and discussed at an early stage (e.g. as part of the Annual Growth Survey), and in any case before as well as after the adoption of convergence/stability programmes; asks the Commission to make explicit how it intends to deal with these spillover effects in its latest version of the scoreboard; 4. Takes the view that Member State governments need to be ready to take action on potential problems, as this is the only way to make sure that the surveillance framework has the desired impact; 5.
