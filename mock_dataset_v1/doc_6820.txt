to the endowment of relevant law enforcement structures with the IT equipment necessary for the operation of SIS. Additionally, the Commission is available both in formal meetings but also on a daily basis to Member States. This covers technical, network and legal issues. In preparation of the implementation of SIS, Romania also actively cooperates and benefits from the assistance available within the TAIEX (Technical Assistance and Information Exchange). TAIEX aims to provide short term technical assistance (i.e. seminars), in line with the overall policy objectives of the Commission, and in the field of approximation, application and enforcement of EU legislation. The Commission maintains good working and official contacts with all representatives of the Romanian administration authorised by the Romanian authorities.
