Answer given by Mr Solbes Mira on behalf of the Commission (6 June 2003) 1. The Commission does not believe that a framework geared to economic stability, of which the Stability and Growth Pact is a central piece, is in any way at odds with the attainment of social objectives. On the contrary, it is precisely the absence of macroeconomic stability that can eventually jeopardise the attainment of social objectives. 2. The Honourable Member can be assured that unemployment and poverty are matters of great concern to the Commission. What matters for the achievement of full employment and prosperity is a sustained high rate of economic growth. The latter can only be established on the basis of conditions of stability as far as prices, public finances and the external account are concerned. 3. In conformity with what has been argued above, the Commission reaffirms its conviction that the stability-oriented framework provided by the Stability and Growth Pact is conducive to economic growth, thereby setting the necessary conditions for the sustainability of social policies. The economic performance of those Member States that are in full compliance with the Pact gives no evidence of such adverse effects as are asserted by the Honourable Member.
