Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (23 December 2005) EC legislation in the banking sector does not include provisions concerning the level of interest rates applied by credit institutions to their customers. Each credit institution has the freedom to define its own commercial policy on lending on the basis of its assessment of the market and the risks involved. However, other factors linked to the specific situation of the local market could also influence credit institutions' policy and therefore, the level of interest rates. The Commission does not carry out systematic and regular surveys on the strengths or weaknesses of the national banking systems. The European Central Bank and the national authorities such as the Ministry of Economy or the national supervisor for credit institutions are better placed to provide an in-depth and detailed analysis to clarify the causes of higher rates in Greece as compared to the other countries of the Eurozone.
