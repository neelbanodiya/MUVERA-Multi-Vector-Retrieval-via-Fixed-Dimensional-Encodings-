Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) The EU has condemned univocally the recurrent violent clashes between security forces and demonstrators, the reactivation and extension of the emergency law, the military trials of civilians and other human rights violations. The EU urged the Egyptian authorities to carry out independent investigations and to bring those responsible to account. The EU also stressed the need for a swift transfer of power to a democratically elected civilian rule. EU concerns were raised recently in several High Representative/Vice-President statements (notably on 18 December, 20 November, 26 November and 10 October 2011), in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs Council of 1 December 2011 and in regular informal contacts with the Egyptian authorities in Brussels and in Cairo. The EU believes that it is crucial to support the Egyptian authorities and the Egyptian people through this very important democratic transformation process. For this reason the EU considers it very important to remain engaged with Egypt and that the application of sanctions is not the right way forward.
