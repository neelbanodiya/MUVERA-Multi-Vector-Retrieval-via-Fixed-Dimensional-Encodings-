Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (7 September 2005) According to Article 3 of the Directive 2001/77/EC of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy OJ L 283, 27.10.2001 . , Member States were required to publish a report by 27 October 2003 on the progress made towards achieving their national targets. Accordingly to Article 6 of the same directive, Member States were required to submit a report by the same date regarding inter alia the reduction of regulatory and non regulatory barriers. All EU‑15 Member States submitted both reports on the measures taken to achieve their targets and on the degree of success of the process including the situation regarding the barriers. New Member States will report on Articles 3 and 6 by October 2005. The Commission adopted the communication ‘The share of renewable energies in the EU’ on the 26 May 2004 COM(2004)366 final. . One of the purposes of this communication was the formal report that the Commission was required to make under Article 3 of Directive 2001/77/EC. Analyses of the progress reports that Member States have submitted, showed that policies in place will probably achieve a share of only 18 %-19 % compared to 14 % in 2000 at Community level. Member States need to take extra measures to achieve the 22 % In accordance with Directive 2001/77/EC, the target on renewable electricity for the EU-15 was 22%, the EU-25 changed this figure to a 21%. target at EU‑15 level. This communication was accompanied by a staff working document SEC(2004)366 final. giving an overview of the different situations of renewable energy sources in all the Member States. By the end of 2005, the Commission plans to adopt a communication on the different support schemes on renewable electricity (Article 4 of Directive 2001/77/EC). This communication will also include the situation regarding existing barriers in the different Member States (Commission report on Article 6). A regular follow-up is foreseen for indicating what progress the individual Member States and the EU as a whole are making (Article 3). This was reported last year in the already mentioned communication ‘The share of renewable energies in the EU’. The exercise will be done every two years and, in 2006, the Commission will again report its conclusions on the degree of progress towards achieving the national targets and the Community target of 21
