Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (11 January 2005) The Honourable Member refers to an ‘ecotax’ on all imports of beer and wine, which is said to be under discussion in Malta. The Commission is not aware of any discussions concerning such a tax. However, if such a tax were to be introduced, it would have to respect Article 90 of the EC Treaty, which prohibits internal discriminatory taxation, directly or indirectly, on the products of other Member States in excess of that imposed directly or indirectly on similar domestic products. The tax might thus be compatible with Community law if it were also applied to the same extent and at the same rates on all domestic beer and wine, or if there were no domestic alcohol production. It follows from Article 3.1 in Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products OJ L 76, 23.3.1992 that another prerequisite for the legality of such a tax on alcohol of certain types would be that the tax has a specific purpose, and that it complies with the tax rules applicable for excise duty and VAT purposes as far as determination of the tax base, calculation of the tax, chargeability and monitoring of the tax are concerned.
