Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2012) In line with the European Consensus on Development, Accra Agenda for Aid effectiveness and the Staff Working Document ‘More and better education for all in developing countries’ issued in 2010, the European Union supports the balanced development of education systems in partner countries, with particular attention to equal access to education, in particular primary education, and improving the quality of education. In the current programming period (2007-2013), the EU supports basic education in 48 developing countries, mainly through bilateral programmes, with a total amount of around EUR 2.2 billion. The EU supports politically and financially specific global and regional initiatives. In the Global Partnership for Education (former Education for All Fast Track Initiative) whose main objective is to ensure that all children have greater access to school, stay in school longer, and receive a quality education, the Commission concentrates on reinforcing the country focus, promoting aid effectiveness and improving the governance of the partnership. In the Copenhagen pledging conference in November 2011 donors pledged more than USD 1.5 billion for the Global Partnership for Education Fund for 2011-2014, and made a commitment to increase bilateral education aid and improve its effectiveness over the next three years. Developing country partners pledged to raise domestic funding for basic education by more than USD 2 billion and committed to improve education access and quality. All government partners committed to the policy goals of improving progress in girls' education, fragile states, learning outcomes and access to education.
