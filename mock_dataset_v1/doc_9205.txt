Understanding of the biological, ecological, biogeochemical, and societal implications of ocean acidification will be further advanced through the four-year EU EPOCA research project http://www.epoca-project.eu/ which will be completed later this year. The Commission attaches the highest importance to addressing the impacts of ocean acidification through a number of its core environmental and climate action policies 2009 White Paper on Adaptation, http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2009:0147:FIN:EN:PDF and the accompanying CSWD on Climate Change and Water, Coasts and Marine Issues. , in particular the MSFD and the Emissions Trading Scheme Commission Regulation No 920/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 7 October 2010, OJ L 270, 14.10.2010 . , and in international negotiations in the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
