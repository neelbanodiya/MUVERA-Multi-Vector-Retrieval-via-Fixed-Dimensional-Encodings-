to justify a refusal to reject terrorism, bearing in mind that there is always a need to try to avoid causing undue alarm and misrepresenting the true nature of the threat, J. whereas it regards itself as the main European forum for dialogue with society and between the various EU institutions and therefore is in a position to share information regarding terrorist organisations and their modus operandi, and the Union's efforts to fight them, K. whereas, in order to deal with terrorism, the EU needs to define and put into practice a European political project that can be easily identified by European citizens and promotes internal and external security, not only a list of general measures, L. whereas a political response can only exist if there is prevention, since otherwise the reaction at European level can only be inadequate and disorganised, M. whereas the EU's internal and external security policies should be coherent and that coherence should be reflected in the functioning of its institutions, 1. Adresses the following recommendations to the European Council and the Council: A) as regards prevention: a) convert the existing list of exhaustive and generic anti-terrorist initiatives into a comprehensive and coherent European political project for fighting terrorism at its roots, both in and outside the Union; b) support fully the current efforts and, if necessary and appropriate, create new instruments and platforms to enable and promote diagnosis and exchange of information between police forces and between intelligence services regarding terrorist organisations and their modus operandi, while respecting data protection principles; c) monitor the role played by financial institutions in the transfer of money in order to prevent suspicious financial flows from being used to fund terrorist activities; d) develop all necessary instruments for the exchange of information regarding suspected terrorists and their organisations with third countries and international organisations, while ensuring respect for privacy and data protection principles; e) create a forum for the exchange of information between all the European institutions, on the basis of twice-yearly meetings, aimed at furthering the exchange, in this case, not of operational information but of data on the strategy and modus operandi of terrorist organisations and the Union's efforts to fight these organisations; f) conduct wide-ranging preventive action based on a dialogue between cultures and religions with a view to promoting mutual awareness and understanding; g) give clear support to the pilot project advanced by the Parliament
