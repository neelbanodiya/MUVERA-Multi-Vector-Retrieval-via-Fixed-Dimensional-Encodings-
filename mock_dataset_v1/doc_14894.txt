ORAL QUESTION H-1017/06 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Seán Ó Neachtain to the Commission Subject: Aviation security arrangements The new EU aviation security regulations introduced on 6 November last across the EU, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland are a good example of European leadership on homeland security policy. In cooperation with the EU, the US and Canada have implemented near identical regulations for liquids in passenger hand luggage, thus extending similar security systems across many of the world's leading airports. What is the Commission doing to promote the 100 ml/ 1 litre restrictions and the 'tamper evident' bags systems as a global standard with its US and Canadian partners, with the International Civil Aviation Organisation and with other stakeholders?
