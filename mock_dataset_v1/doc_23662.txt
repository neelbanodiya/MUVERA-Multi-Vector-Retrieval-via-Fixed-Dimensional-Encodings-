The European Parliament began looking at these issues in its resolution of 7 October 2010 on EU action on oil exploration and extraction in the EU (promoted initially by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety). This proposed Regulation amending Regulation (EC) No. 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), represents a first legislative opportunity for Parliament to examine ways of strengthening the existing functions of EMSA so as to further environmental protection objectives and accident response capacity in EU waters. The proposed Regulation should make best use of the Agency's expertise and strengthen its role in assisting and supporting the Commission and Member States in relation to the prevention of pollution from offshore oil and gas installations and in the development of requirements and guidance on the licensing of oil and gas exploration and production. The proposed Regulation should also provide for an enhanced role for systems such as CleanSeaNet and the electronic detection system, used by EMSA in its existing work and extend EMSA's inspection functions.
