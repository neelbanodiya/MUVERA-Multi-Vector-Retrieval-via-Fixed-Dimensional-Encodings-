INTRODUCTION The 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure confirmed the principle that "the implementation of appropriations entered in the budget requires a prior adoption of a basic legal instrument" Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure 1999 , Official Journal C172/1, point 36 . This point of the Interinstitutional Agreement is mirrowed in article 49 (1) of the Financial Regulation, Council Regulation N° 1605/2002, Official Journal L 248/1 and developed in Articles 31 and 32 of the implementating Measures, Commission Regulation N° 2342/2002, Official Journal L 357/1. . Exceptions to this principle were split out and may apply to three types of action: pilot projects, preparatory actions and one-off actions See Interinstitutional Agreement 1999 supra note , point 37; See Financial Regulation supra note 1 article 49 (1) . In the first two cases, which we considerate in this working document, there are strict limits to these exceptions as regards both time and amounts. Pilot projects are " aimed at testing the feasibility of an action and its usefulness" while preparatory actions should " intend to prepare proposals with a view to the adoption of future Community actions" . According to the 1999 Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Regulation, commitment appropriations for Pilot Projects may be entered for two financial years with a maximum annual amount of EUR 32 million See Interinstitutional Agreement 1999 supra note , point 37 (a) (i); See Commission Regulation on Implementing Measures supra note 1, article 32 (1) . The respective amounts for Preparatory Actions are EUR 75 million per year , out of which a maximum of EUR 30 million for new actions See Interinstitutional Agreement 1999 supra note , point 37 (a) (ii); See Commission Regulation on Implementing Measures
