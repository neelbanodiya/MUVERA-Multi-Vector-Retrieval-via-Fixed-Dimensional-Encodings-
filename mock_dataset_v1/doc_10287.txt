WRITTEN QUESTION E-1635/07 by Ashley Mote (ITS) to the Council (29 March 2007) Subject: How can a citizen of one country be the head of state in another? Since all law in the United Kingdom is enacted in the name of Her Majesty the Queen as head of state, the relationship between the EU and the UK has always been in doubt. As such, by definition, Her Majesty is above the law. How else, otherwise, can the law be enacted in her name? Mr Major's absurd claim after signing the Treaty of Maastricht that Her Majesty was now a European citizen was as fundamentally flawed as it was foolish. Leaving aside the problems for British subjects, important though they continue to be, the more pressing problem that arose after Maastricht was the UK's relationship with its Commonwealth partners. Some of these dominions, including Australia, New Zealand and Canada, enjoy having the Queen as their head of state. In a nutshell, the unanswerable question they faced was — and still is —‘how can a citizen of one country be a head of state in another?’ The EU's determination to press ahead with the proposed European Union constitution, however it is fudged and dressed up this time around, brings this same question to the forefront once again. So, on behalf of large numbers of subjects of the British Crown, especially those living in the countries mentioned, I ask the Council for its answer to this basic question: How can a citizen of one country be the head of state in another?
