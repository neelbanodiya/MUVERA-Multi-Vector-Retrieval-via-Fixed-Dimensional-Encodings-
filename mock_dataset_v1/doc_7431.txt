Question for written answer E-010580/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (20 December 2010) Subject: Crop rotation in the context of cross-compliance in Greece In a press release of 12 November 2010 http://www.minagric.gr/greek/press/2010/11/greek121110b.shtml , the Hellenic Ministry of Rural Development and Food set out the contents of a Joint Ministerial Decision on cross-compliance rules http://www.minagric.gr/greek/agro_pol/kap/pollaplh2010.pdf and informed Greek farmers that they could comply with the obligation to maintain soil organic matter levels, required in the context of cross-compliance pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:030:0016:0099:EL:PDF , by employing crop rotation in accordance with the method set out below. ‘Farmers may grow at least three different crops on their holdings each year, with no restriction on the area for each crop, i.e. a specific percentage for each crop is not required, and there will be no examination of on which agricultural parcel each crop is grown’. The Ministry also provides an indicative example of such compliance. ‘A farmer has five parcels of land, 2 with an area of 10 hectares, 1 measuring 1 hectare and two parcels each of 0.3 hectares in area. The farmer may grow tomatoes on 0.3 hectares, wheat on the other parcel of 0.3 hectares and cotton on all of the rest (i.e. on 21 hectares, which is equivalent to a little less than 3 % of the total area). He thus complies fully with the crop rotation requirement’. Does the Commission consider that the specific objective of the cross-compliance policy is achieved by implementing the above proposal by the Greek Government?
