most investigations have been launched, namely the Structural Funds, trade, customs, aid, agriculture and direct expenditure. Member States should identify which national authorities should assist OLAF with on-site checks. Finally, MEPs call on the Commission to advertise the post of Director of OLAF in Spring 2004, as the present Director's appointment is due to end in March 2005 and the procedures for this appointment take a long time. Court of Auditors 2002 Annual Report - some reform but problems remain Presentation of the Court of Auditors' annual report Debate: 04.12.2003 Fabra VALLÉS , President of the Court of Auditors, will present the 2002 annual report. The Court is of the opinion that the 2002 accounts of the European Communities prepared by the Commission faithfully reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial position of the Communities at year-end, except for some shortcomings caused by weaknesses in the design of the accounting system. However, this is the ninth year in a row that the Court of Auditors has failed to give overall approval to the Commission's accounts. The Court cannot provide assurance in respect of payments, such as agricultural expenditure, Structural Funds, internal policies and external actions which accounts for around 80% of the budget. The Court welcomes the action plan for the modernisation of the accounting system adopted by the Commission at the end of 2002, which is expected to become fully effective in 2005. However, if the Commission is to implement all the in-depth reforms necessary, this timing may be over ambitious. The Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the accounts are legal and regular in respect of own resources, commitments, administrative expenditure and pre-accession aid, although supervisory systems and controls should be improved in the latter case. 2002 Annual Report in full: http://www.eca.eu.int/EN/RA/2002/ra02.htm Summary of the 2002 Annual Report: http://www.eca.eu.int/en/noteinfo/2002/nira02.pdf Economic & Monetary Affairs Lower VAT for hairdressing and CDs?
