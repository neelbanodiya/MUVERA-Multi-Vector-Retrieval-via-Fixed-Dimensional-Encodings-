WRITTEN QUESTION E-2452/06 by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann (PSE) to the Commission (9 June 2006) Subject: Corporate social responsibility The Commission's Green Paper of 2001 on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the multi-stakeholder forum of July 2002 marked a major advance in terms of citizens' democracy and global business philosophy, introducing, in particular, an innovatory and balanced definition of corporate social responsibility, taking account of the satisfaction of ‘basic legal obligations’ and, even more so, the investment considered necessary in ‘human capital, the environment and the relations with stakeholders’. Is it necessary to remind the Commission that workers stand at the heart of enterprise development, as the first agents and the motor of a company? However, in its most recent communication on the subject, the Commission, having consulted business circles only, appears to have forgotten its own good intentions, taking account of the interests of only one component of the enterprise, namely management and shareholders. The protection of workers and the environment has gone by the board in the name of sustainable growth, supposedly serving the principle of CSR. The promotion of workers' rights and the environment are being sacrificed in favour of a ‘sustainable market economy’. CSR, which should enable a global, balanced view between all stakeholders in the enterprise, is being turned into an alibi for deregulation. The Commission is offering a blank cheque to management without calling for any social or environmental measures in return. How can the Commission justify its retreat on corporate social responsibility, which should serve to ensure a balance between the interests of companies and the defence of workers' rights?
