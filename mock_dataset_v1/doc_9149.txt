concerned; 27. Acknowledges that regional economic integration can create growth and jobs in developing countries and thereby contribute to reducing poverty; welcomes, accordingly, the fact that EDF funding in this area has more than doubled over the financial period in question; 28. Regrets that EDF support for regional integration has not yet been wholly effective, mainly owing to lack of capacity on the part of the African authorities, the overlapping membership of African regional economic organisations leading to the duplication of efforts and dispersion of resources, and inadequate support and coordination from Commission Delegations, principally due to lack of resources; 29. Calls, accordingly, on the Commission to step up capacity-building for East African and West African regional economic organisations and their institutions, including support for national parliaments and local civil society, and to encourage convergence between regional blocs with a view to eliminating overlapping membership over time, whilst taking care to respect partner countries’ ownership of the process; 30. Calls on the Commission and the European External Action Service to allocate more resources in order to enable Union Delegations to manage regional integration processes more effectively, and to ensure greater coordination and more coherence between regional and national programmes; 31. Insists that the Union should not pressure African states to sign up to Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) any faster or which cover a greater range of issues than they want to, and that the Union should avoid undermining existing regional groupings by agreeing EPAs with individual countries; 32. Insists that smaller states’ fund allocation, especially for the least-developed countries, should be more focused on sustainable economic development, such as through wealth creation mechanisms, so as to reduce the dependency on regional economic ’giants’, such as Nigeria in West Africa; calls on the Commission to continue its funding for regional programmes, otherwise known as Intra-ACP Programmes, which cover several or all countries in a particular region; Use of accrued interest 33. Does not agree with the use of accrued interest on EDF treasury accounts (including transfers from the period 2001-2007), which is estimated at EUR 34 000 000, to cover staff expenditure but considers that it should only be used for expenditure for projects and programmes; asks the Commission to explain what the policy in the past was and, if necessary, to make proposals to amend the regulation in force in line with this principle without delay; Budget support 34.
