ORAL QUESTION WITH DEBATE O-0084/02 pursuant to Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure by W.G. van Velzen , Ruth Hieronymi , Christopher Beazley and Mario Mauro , on behalf of the PPE-DE Group to the Commission Subject: Safeguarding the freedom and pluralism of the media in an enlarged European Union In 1997, the Commission published a Green Paper on the convergence of the telecommunications, media and information technology sectors, and the implications for regulation ( COM(97)0623 /final). Since then, technological change has accelerated dramatically, with different services (e.g. Internet access, television and telephony) being provided to consumers over a range of devices, whether it be a TV, PC, or a fixed or mobile telephone. The market players from telecoms, the media and information technology sectors continue to position themselves to enter each other's market, as well as to protect their existing markets. Furthermore, the forthcoming enlargement to ten new Member States will add to the diversity of national situations. In order to assess these developments, and with particular reference to the impact of mergers, alliances and joint ventures on the operation of the single market, media pluralism, the right to freedom of expression, including the right to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers, and access by all European citizens to the services of the information society, notably through the promotion of interoperability, is the Commission prepared to draw up a new Green Paper, setting out the issues and suggesting how best the EU and Member States should tackle them?
