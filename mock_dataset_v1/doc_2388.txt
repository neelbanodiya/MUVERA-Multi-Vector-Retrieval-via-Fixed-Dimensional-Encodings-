Answer given by Mr Barroso on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) A common definition of the term ‘non-governmental organisation’ cannot be based on a legal definition given the wide variations in laws relating to NGO activities, according to which an NGO may have, for instance, the legal status of a charity, non-profit association or a foundation. The term ‘NGO’ can nevertheless be used as shorthand to refer to a range of organisations that normally share the following characteristics: — NGOs are not created to generate personal profit. Although they may have paid employees and engage in revenue-generating activities they do not distribute profits or surpluses to members or management; — NGOs are voluntary. This means that they are formed voluntarily and that there is usually an element of voluntary participation in the organisation; — NGOs are distinguished from informal or ad hoc groups by having some degree of formal or institutional existence. Usually, NGOs have formal statutes or other governing document setting out their mission, objectives and scope. They are accountable to their members and donors; — NGOs are independent, in particular of government and other public authorities and of political parties or commercial organisations; — NGOs are not self-serving in aims and related values. Their aim is to act in the public arena at large, on concerns and issues related to the well being of people, specific groups of people or society as a whole. They are not pursuing the commercial or professional interests of their members.
