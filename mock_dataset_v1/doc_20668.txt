Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (10 January 2006) In the 2005 progress report on Turkey published on 9 November 2005, there is detailed reference to the problems relating to freedom of expression and Article 301. In recent weeks, the Member of the Commission responsible for enlargement has repeatedly expressed his concerns regarding freedom of expression in Turkey. When addressing both Turkish and European parliamentarians at the EU-Turkey Joint Parliamentary Committee in Brussels on 23 November 2005, he stated clearly that ‘it appears the new penal code does not provide sufficient protection of the freedom of expression and the current practice is in breach of the European Convention of Human Rights’. A number of recent cases that have been brought against author Orhan Pamuk and other writers and publishers in Turkey, clearly show that the new penal code, as it is interpreted by certain prosecutors and judges, does not provide sufficient protection for those expressing non-violent opinions. In view of the repetition of such cases, the code will need to be amended in the light of the relevant European standards. The Honourable Member will note that in the Commission’s proposal for an accession partnership with Turkey, the Commission has included priorities on the importance of guaranteeing freedom of expression in Turkey. The Honourable Member should rest assured that, on the basis of these priorities, the Commission will continue to raise its concerns regarding this situation at every available opportunity.
