WRITTEN QUESTION E-2404/10 by Michał Tomasz Kamiński (ECR) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: EU-Ukraine association agreement The association agreement is a way of deepening and broadening the relationship between the EU and Ukraine by enhancing political and economic integration. What is the state of play as regards the negotiations on the free trade agreement, which is an integral part of the association agreement? Bearing in mind the results of the EU-Ukraine summit of 4 December 2009, which highlight the progress made in talks on setting up a visa-free scheme for Ukrainian citizens, is the Commission working on a roadmap which would clearly set out the conditions and requirements to be met by Ukraine with a view to the establishment of a visa-free scheme for its citizens? Despite the fact that the reform process could last many years, confirmation that the political will is there to see Ukraine finally take its place among the EU family might encourage Kiev to press on with, or even speed up, reforms in the country. Does the Commission intend to include in the association agreement the conditions that Ukraine must meet in order for the EU to confirm its prospects for membership unequivocally?
