Answer given by Mr Figel’ on behalf of the Commission (24 November 2006) The Commission does not have ranking tables of the best universities worldwide at its disposal, but is aware that several of these tables exist such as: The World University Rankings 2006 by the Times Higher Education Supplement and the Academic Ranking of World Universities — 2006 by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Each of these rankings has different strengths and weaknesses. Although they are useful in giving an image of how universities may be seen, the image is necessarily impressionistic. In particular, none of them takes adequate account of the diversity in universities' missions; this diversity means that no true picture can be obtained by looking at all universities with one single set of criteria. The Commission also refers the Honourable Member to the answer it gave to Oral Question H‑881/06 during Parliament's part-session of November 2006 Oral answer of 14 November 2006. .
