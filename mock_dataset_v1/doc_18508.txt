WRITTEN QUESTION E-1981/04 by Catherine Stihler (PSE) to the Commission (10 September 2004) Subject: Commission action on the European Parliament written declaration on cat and dog fur In 2003 a majority of MEPs signed Written Declaration 0017/2003 calling for a ban on the import of cat and dog fur into the European Union. As one of the many MEPs who signed the declaration I would like to ask how the Commission has responded to date, and what future action might be expected in relation to the declaration.
