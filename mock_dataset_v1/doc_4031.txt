following the Interim EPA (IEPA) should not hinder local production and infant industries, since EPAs should contribute to the diversification of ACP economies, 1. Stresses that these agreements cannot be regarded as satisfactory unless they achieve the following objectives: offering the ACP countries support for sustainable development; promoting their participation in world trade; strengthening the regionalisation process; revitalising trade between the European Union and ACP countries; and promoting the economic diversification of ACP countries; 2. Stresses, in particular, the original raison d'être of these agreements, namely development, poverty reduction and contributing to the achievement of the MDGs; 3. Believes that achieving these objectives will require targeted protection of the ACP countries from certain possible negative consequences resulting from the implementation of EPAs, providing support to help them gain real benefit from trade preferences and promoting their economic and social development; calls on the Commission and the Member States to provide increased and adequate assistance to facilitate economic transition following the initialling of the IEPAs; 4.

Recognises the benefits that the signing of the IEPA has had for exporters, by expanding the possibilities for exports to the European Union after the expiration of the Cotonou trade regime on 1 January 2008, and therefore avoiding the damage which could have been caused to ACP exporters had they been obliged to operate under less favourable trade systems; 7.

Asks for a prompt ratification procedure in order to make the benefits of the IEPA available for the partner countries without unnecessary delay; 9. Points out that, if the agreement were confirmed, major efforts as well as massive European
