Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2007) 1. Directive 2004/52/EC OJ L 166, 30.4.2004. aims to remove the barriers to interoperability of tolling systems within the Community, among other reasons to support the operation of the internal market. The Commission obviously shares this objective. In addition, electronic tolling systems can offer platforms for the deployment of intelligent transport systems and support various road charging schemes. 2. It has not been possible to finalise the decisions relating to the definition of the European toll service by 1 July 2006, as implementation of the directive raises a number of very complex issues which the Commission has sought to address in close cooperation with the stakeholders whose expertise is necessary for the definition of the European electronic toll service. Twelve working groups have been put in place in order to carry out the appropriate studies necessary to define all the conditions necessary to enable interoperability to work from all points of view. The last report was handed over in March 2007. 3. The Commission is aware that a number of Member States are considering the installation of tolling systems on their territory in the near to medium term and that their interoperability must be ensured. 4. The Commission is currently drafting the legislation necessary for the definition of the European electronic toll service. A meeting of the Toll Committee established under Directive 2004/52/EC is scheduled for June 2007 to discuss the Commission’s proposals. In addition, close contacts are maintained with the European Standards Organisations in order to obtain a timely delivery of the required European standards.
