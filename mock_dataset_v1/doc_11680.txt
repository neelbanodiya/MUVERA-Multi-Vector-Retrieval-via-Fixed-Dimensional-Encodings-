ORAL QUESTION H-0997/06 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Paul Rübig to the Council Subject: Fuel rod problems at the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic The newspaper ‘Oberösterreichische Nachrichten’ reported on 2 November 2006 that, at the Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic, there were ever increasing problems in the active zone because of excessively deformed fuel rods. The extent of the problems was such that safe operation could no longer be guaranteed. Reportedly, two fuel elements had already been irreparably damaged, and it was not yet certain how this was to be compensated for because replacing them with other fuel elements presupposed extensive recalculations. What steps will the Council be taking in this connection? What measures does the Council take to ensure that nuclear power stations with serious technical defects are immediately taken off-line? Has the Council already drawn up a plan of measures enabling prompt and effective action to be taken in such situations?
