Answer given by Mrs Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (2 June 2008) In 2006, the Commission adopted the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals COM(2006)13 final. . The action plan foresees that the Commission will submit to Parliament and the Council a report on the protection of pigs in 2009 with particular reference to the castration of pigs. Environmental, social and economic aspects will be considered in the report. In order to prepare its report, the Commission has launched a research programme on the castration of piglets named PIGCAS http://www.rennes.inra.fr/pigcas/index.htm , ‘Attitudes, practices and state of the art regarding piglet castration in Europe’. The overall objective of the project is to provide information that will support EU policy on the welfare implications of castration in pigs. This is achieved via a review of existing information and gathering of new information regarding the practice of pig castration in the EU, stakeholder attitudes to this practice and possible alternatives to existing surgical interventions. The project started on 1 January 2007, and the final report will be delivered by the end of 2008. Meanwhile, a specific pilot study to explore practical alternatives to castration is in preparation and it is due to start before the end of 2008. The Commission will decide, in the light of this report, whether further action on the castration of pigs is required.
