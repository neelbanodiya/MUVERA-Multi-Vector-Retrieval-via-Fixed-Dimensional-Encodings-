Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (11 December 2008) The Commission does not share the view expressed in the question. All Member States share the common interest in reducing the risks of climate change. The EU's climate objectives were set at the European Council in March 2007 and March 2008 and confirmed again at the European Council in October 2008. The EU Emission Trading System (ETS) is a key element in the mix of EU policy instruments to meet these objectives. The result will be long-term sustainable growth and employment, in an economy that looks to the future by investing in clean technologies and infrastructure. The EU ETS has been in operation since 1 January 2005 and the Commission's proposal to review the ETS will further improve the scheme to exploit fully its potential to contribute to reaching the EU's climate commitments in an economically efficient manner and to contribute to transforming the EU into a low carbon economy. The review proposal is currently being considered by the institutions and the Commission is working to help resolve outstanding issues and facilitate an agreement in first reading by the end of 2008.
