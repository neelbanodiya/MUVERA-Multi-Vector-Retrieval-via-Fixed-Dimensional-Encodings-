Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (7 September 2005) On 5 July 2005 the Commission decided to bring before the Court of Justice five Member States (Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain and Luxembourg) which, despite having received reasoned opinions, have not yet transposed the directive on the internal electricity market Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC — Statements made with regard to decommissioning and waste management activities, OJ L 176, 15.7.2003. and/or the directive on the internal gas market Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC, OJ L 176, 15.7.2003. and to send a reasoned opinion to Portugal regarding transposal of the Electricity Directive. These two directives are essential for ensuring the opening-up of the electricity and gas markets in Europe and they will determine the new configuration of the European energy market and serve as a basis for the development of energy partnerships with countries bordering the EU, notably the Western Balkans. The Commission would point out that transposal of the directives is not the only criterion for assessing actual opening‑up to competition; this will also be reflected by economic indicators (changes of supplier and price in particular). It is closely monitoring the integration and degree of opening‑up of the energy markets to competition and each year it publishes a benchmarking report. It will send an overall report on the functioning of the market to Parliament and the Council by 1 January 2006. It also decided, on 13 June 2005, to launch an inquiry in the energy sector, on a proposal from the Commissioner responsible for competition and the Commissioner responsible for energy. The combined approaches (monitoring of legislation, benchmarking report and sectoral inquiry) are a strong and coordinated response to consumer worries, guaranteeing freedom of choice of supplier and access to energy at a fair price.
