in disfavoured areas. Finally as regards the third issue, as a candidate country Turkey has the obligation to gradually align its national legislation with the EU acquis and to implement it at the latest by the date of accession to the EU. Turkey is currently in the process of harmonising with the EU legislation on plant protection products, in the context of Chapter 12 of accession negotiations (food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy) which was opened in June 2010. Turkish legislation on maximum levels of residues of plant protection products (MRLs) is currently only partially harmonised and is planned to be fully harmonised only 2 years before accession. The consequence of a delay regarding Turkey's alignment with EU legislation on maximum levels for MRLs could be the risk that European standards are not respected at production level. Given that the MRLs requirements are already applicable now for all exports of Turkey to the EU, this could imply a risk that hazelnuts originating in Turkey cannot be placed into the EU market when not complying with the MRLs. However, so far Turkey has always been able to comply with the EU MRLs for hazelnuts. Therefore, the Commission does not foresee significant problems for the harmonisation process in this area.
