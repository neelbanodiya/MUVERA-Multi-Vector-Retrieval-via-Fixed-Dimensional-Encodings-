Answer given by Mr Michel on behalf of the Commission (20 February 2007) The Commission has been closely monitoring the situation of Marie Therese Nlandu, since she was apprehended by the police, on 21 November 2006, while she was enquiring about her collaborators, under arrest for illegal arms detention since 20 November 2006. The Commission has been working in a coordinated manner with the Member States. In this regard, the EU presidency sent a letter on 5 January 2007 both to the Justice and Defence Ministers, raising the EU's concern on this matter and, in particular, stressing the EU's disquiet over the fact that a civilian person is being deferred to a military jurisdiction. No answer has so far been received from the authorities, which is probably linked to the fact that a new government is in the process of being formed. However, regarding the juridical point as to whether Ms Nlandu can be judged by a military jurisdiction, expert lawyers have not found it anti-constitutional, even though they have underlined the absence of a legal basis, namely an organic law, in order to legislate on this point. The EC will continue to follow closely the situation with a view to encouraging the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) authorities to rapidly clarify all the ambiguities related to Ms Nlandu's detention.
