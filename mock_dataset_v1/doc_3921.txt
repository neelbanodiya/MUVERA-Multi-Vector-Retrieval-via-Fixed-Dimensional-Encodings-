Answer given by Ms de Palacio on behalf of the Commission (26 January 2004) In its Road Safety Action Programme Communication from the Commission on the European Road Safety Action Programme. Halving the number of road accident victims in the European Union by 2010: A shared responsibility [ COM(2003) 311 final]. , the Commission announced its intention to examine national trials of Intelligent Speed Adaptation (ISA) devices and to assess their acceptability to the public. In this context, the Commission is giving its support to the development of ISA devices, particularly through the ongoing Prosper and Speed Alert projects. These projects are aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of ISA devices, the cost of introducing them, the industrial implications of creating an infrastructure to support these devices, various marketing strategies and their acceptability. As regards vulnerable road users, most of the actions announced in the European Road Safety Action Programme will significantly increase their protection. Certain actions are designed specifically to protect vulnerable road users, such as promoting road safety training from school age, encouraging the use of crash helmets by all two-wheel motor vehicle users, continuing to improve cars in order to reduce the severity of accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, and improving the safety of motorcycles and their users. Certain measures are being considered regarding the use of information and communications technologies for the protection of vulnerable road users, some of which also form part of European research projects. These measures, which could help prevent accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, currently remain longer term solutions. The Commission is therefore supporting research projects on ISA devices, while also assessing other kinds of measures for the protection of vulnerable road users.
