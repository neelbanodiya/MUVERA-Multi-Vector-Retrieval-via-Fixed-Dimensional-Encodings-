WRITTEN QUESTION E-5695/08 by Ilda Figueiredo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 October 2008) Subject: Support for agricultural cooperatives — Portel The agricultural cooperative in Portel, which has around 600 active partners, is particularly concerned with the production and marketing of olive oil, and this is crucial in order to maintain high-quality production and jobs for farmers in an area where there are no alternative sources of employment. The cooperative also provides other support for farmers, which is vital for their survival, but it is struggling with financial and liquidity problems that prevent farmers being paid immediately on delivery of their olives, so that they have to wait until the olive oil is sold. Can the Commission provide the following information: 1. What support can be given to agricultural cooperatives, in particular through a properly endowed budget appropriation that will make it possible to pay olive growers immediately on delivery of their produce? 2. What support can be envisaged in order to promote sales of olive oil, in particular for export to third countries?
