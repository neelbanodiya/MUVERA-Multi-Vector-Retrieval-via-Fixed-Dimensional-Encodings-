members of the European and national parliaments could play this role; (d) these rapporteurs should then meet in a joint European conference and endeavour to draw common conclusions from the national debates; 15. Considers that where there were suggestions within the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe that would without question make the EU more citizen-friendly, work on these should continue, and in particular, given the finding by the European Ombudsman in a Special Report that the Council is guilty of maladministration when legislating in secret, calls upon the Council to comply immediately within the Ombudsman's recommendations; 16. Proposes that a study be drawn up of the costs of not having a Constitution, with reference to governance, democracy and transparency, modelled on the study on the 'cost of non-Europe' drawn up to prepare for the launch of a standard European single market; 17. Considers that the debate should also consider how to solve the problems in France and the Netherlands and how to deal with these referendums, without deceiving the populations of those EU Member States which have already adopted the draft Constitution; 18. Calls on the UK and Austrian Presidency to begin preparations for a phase of reflection as proposed above.
