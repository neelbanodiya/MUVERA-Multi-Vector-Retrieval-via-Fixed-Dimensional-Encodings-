rotary evaporator. Repeat the operation if a greater quantity of extract is required. Dissolve the residue in 5 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture. 5.4.3. Preparation of ion-exchange columns CATION-EXCHANGE COLUMN Place 600 ml cation-exchange resin (5.3.5) in a 3 000 ml beaker and cover by adding 2 000 ml hydrochloric acid (5.3.7). Allow to stand for at least two hours, with occasional stirring. Decant the acid and transfer the resin into the column (5.3.11) by means of deionised water. The column should contain a glass-wool plug. Wash the column with deionised water at a rate of 10-30 ml/min until the eluate is free of chloride. Displace the water with 2 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture (5.3.3) at a rate of 10-30 ml/min. The exchange column is now ready for operation. ANION-EXCHANGE COLUMN Place 600 ml anion-exchange resin (5.3.6) in a beaker and cover by adding 2 000 ml deionised water. Allow the resin to swell for at least two hours. Transfer the resin into the column by means of deionised water. The column should contain a glass-wool plug. Wash the column with 0,3 M ammonium bicarbonate solution (5.3.4) until free of chloride. This requires about 5 000 ml solution. Wash again with 2 000 ml deionised water. Displace the water with 2 000 ml isopropanol/water mixture (5.3.3) at a rate of 10-30 ml/min. The exchange column is now in the OH form and ready for operation. 5.4.4. Ion-exchange procedure Connect the exchange columns so that the cation-exchange column is placed on top of the anion-exchange column. Heat the exchange columns to 50 °C using thermostatic control. Heat 5 000 ml of the solution obtained in item 5.4.2 to 60 °C and pass the solution through the exchanger combination at a rate of 20 ml/min. Wash the columns with 1 000 ml hot isopropanol/water mixture (5.3.3). To obtain the non-ionic surfactants collect the filtrate and filter washings and evaporate to dryness, preferably by means of a rotary evaporator. The residue contains the BiAS. Add deionised water until a defined volume is obtained and determine the BiAS content in an aliquot. The solution is used as a standard solution of non-ionic surfactants for the degradation test. The solution should be kept at a temperature below 5 °C. 5.4.5. Regeneration of ion exchange resins The cation exchanger is rejected after use. Passing about 5 000-6 000 ml of ammonium bicarbonate solution (5.3.4) down the column
