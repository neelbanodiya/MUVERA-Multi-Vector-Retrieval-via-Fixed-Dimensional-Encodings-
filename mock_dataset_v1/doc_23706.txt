Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (7 April 2009) The Commission is in favour of the idea of mutual recognition of disability status by the Member States with a view to allowing people with disabilities to enjoy various benefits, including when using public transport. However, the lack of an agreement on the definition of disability and degrees thereof, diversity of practice and a certain reluctance among Member States prevent the Commission for the time being from proposing a scheme for an EU‑wide uniform certificate for persons with disabilities, a common European escort's pass or even mutual recognition of national disability identity cards granting entitlement to special benefits. The Commission, which is committed to ensuring genuine, effective mobility for all EU citizens, including citizens with disabilities, has taken and is taking other initiatives. It proposed action at Community level which resulted in the adoption of the regulations on the rights of disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility when travelling by air and on rail passengers’ rights and obligations Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 of the Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, (OJ L 204, 26.7.2006) and Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on rail passengers’ rights and obligations (OJ L 315, 3.12.2007). . Those Regulations provide for a number of measures applicable at every EU airport and railway station, as well as during travel throughout the Community, to ensure that passengers with reduced mobility have equal access to air and rail transport without discrimination and at no additional cost and that they receive the necessary assistance. Similar measures are being prepared for travel by sea and inland waterways and for bus and coach transport. Furthermore, the Commission is also promoting the use of a standardised model parking card for people with disabilities introduced by Council Recommendation 98/376/EC Recommendation as amended by Council Recommendation 2008/205/EC of 3 March 2008 adapting Recommendation 98/376/EC on a parking card for people with disabilities, by reason of the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, Romania, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic (OJ
