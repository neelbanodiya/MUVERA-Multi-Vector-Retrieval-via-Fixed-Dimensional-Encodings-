application of the principle of mutual recognition within the EU to essential requirements for supplying cross-border financial services, including dispute settlement procedures; stresses the need for efficient dispute settlement with third countries; The measures on prudential rules and supervision 26. Expresses guarded satisfaction with regard to the measures mentioned in the Action Plan because they do not address three important aspects of the future supervisory and regulatory regime in the EU: - whether the fact that the lender of the last resort when monetary policy is concentrated on one institution while supervision rests with another 15 national institutions, and when the generalised liquidity effect created by taxpayers' funds or by private money provided by banks or other market participants, would have implications for the conduct of monetary policy; - whether greater formal centralisation of supervision of all credit institutions through the ECB as provided for in the Treaty (Article 105) should be pursued and, if not, how and by whom centralised action should be implemented, if such a need should arise because of technological change and a new competitive environment, which are both pervasive factors; - whether the 'stateless' financial groups in Europe, the result of internationalisation, disintermediation and advance communication networks, call into question the traditional structure within which such supervision is effected; 27. Welcomes the Commission's consultation document on equity capitalisation in the context of the Basle Convention on banking supervision in the G-10 that justifies in-depth analysis of the alternative approach to regulatory capital if based on an 'internal ratings-based approach', because major issues need clarification, i.e. the recognition of rating agencies and the competitiveness of the European financial industry; calls on the Commission to submit a Green Paper on the list of directives needing amendment; 28. Calls on the Commission to submit a Green Paper on the creation of an EU Securities and Exchange Commission (Euro-Sec) along the lines of the US-SEC; the Green Paper should concentrate on the identification of asymmetries embodied in the regulatory or supervisory rules and practices of the fifteen European authorities, on the problems securitisation and disintermediation would create for effective supervision and the harmonisation of national structures of regulation/supervision; 29. Asks the Commission to submit a Green paper on whether there is a need to create a single Advisory Forum for financial stability in Europe in order to enhance cooperation and coordination among European supervisors (banking, capital markets and insurance),
