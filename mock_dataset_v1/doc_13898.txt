Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (13 October 2003) The first of the Honourable Members' questions relates to the common organisation of the wine market under which aid is granted on concentrated grape must used to increase the alcoholic strength of wine. In fact since the aid was introduced in 1982 it has been differentiated by the origin of the must. In general the aid rates for musts of wine-growing zone CIII, which includes Sicily, are higher than those for must originating in the other zones. There is a very restricted waiver for certain musts from zones other than C III produced under particular conditions. Nonetheless, given the general reorientation of the common agricultural policy to which the Honourable Members allude that has occurred since the measure was introduced, the Commission is planning a thorough assessment of all features of this aid. The Honourable Members' second question relates to the economic and social cohesion policy, under which the wine sector can be aided from the Community Structural Funds, in this case the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section. For the period 2000-2006 the sector can be aided through the Sicilia Regional Operational Programme. The relevant measures covered those covering farm-level investments (4.06) processing and marketing of agricultural products (4.09) and marketing of high quality agricultural products (4.13). Decisions on future measures will be taken in partnership with the Commission, with the monitoring committee for the regional operational programme closely involved.
