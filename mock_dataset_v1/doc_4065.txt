Question for written answer E-001903/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (3 March 2011) Subject: The case of Aster Fissehatsion in Eritrea The Commission may be aware of the case of Aster Fissehatsion, the former director of the Eritrean Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Ms Fissehatsion is a member of a group named the ‘G15’, an organisation of political dissidents opposed to the isolationist, authoritarian and repressive nature of the Afewerki administration. Little is known about this high ranking group of incarcerated political dissidents; but it is rumoured that several may have died in prison or been executed. Detained without charge or trial since 2001 for signing an open letter calling for transparency in government and democratic and judicial reform, Ms Fissehatsion has reportedly been denied basic rights, including access to medical treatment and communication with relatives. Will the Commission urgently mandate the High Representative of the Union to raise these concerns over the case of Ms Fissehatsion and the ‘G15’ in its dialogue with Eritrea, given that in the period 2009‑13 Eritrea will receive approximately EUR 122 million of EU funds? Has the Commission considered suspending EU aid under the ACP agreement, given the egregious human rights abuses in that country?
