Question for written answer E-012459/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Patrick Le Hyaric (GUE/NGL) (9 January 2012) Subject: VP/HR — Living conditions of the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem About 270 000 Palestinians currently live in East Jerusalem, 55 000 of whom are separated from the city centre by the security wall built in breach of international law. As access to East Jerusalem is controlled by a combination of physical and administrative barriers, it is extremely difficult for these Palestinians to move around East Jerusalem or to leave it, and, furthermore, for the Palestinians who do not live in East Jerusalem to enter it. The system of restrictions even impedes access by Palestinians, including patients in ambulances, to medical equipment in East Jerusalem that provides specialist care and emergency services not available elsewhere in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. In view of the situation in which thousands of Palestinian men, women and children living in East Jerusalem find themselves: 1. What action has been taken by the Vice-President/High Representative and the European External Action Service to improve living conditions, access to the most essential services and freedom of movement? 2. As the Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem do not have guaranteed residential status and as 32 % of Palestinian housing in East Jerusalem has not received planning permission, what action has been taken by the Vice-President/High Representative and the European External Action Service to ensure that these residents are not subject to expulsion or destruction of their houses? 3. Does the Vice-President/High Representative agree with the regular reports from the representatives of European diplomatic missions in East Jerusalem that strongly criticise a policy of de facto annexation knowingly and systematically carried out by the Israeli authorities?
