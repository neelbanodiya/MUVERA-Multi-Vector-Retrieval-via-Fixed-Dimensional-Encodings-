Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (20 January 2011) The Honourable Members are probably referring to the press communication published on the occasion of the European Day of Languages 2010 IP/2010/1164. . The EUR 50 million referred to is an estimation of the total grants awarded by the European Union for language related projects and networks. There is no detailed breakdown on how many of these involve businesses. The Commission's policy to promote languages for business and employability was launched with the 2008 Communication ‘Multilingualism — an asset for Europe and a shared commitment’ COM(2008)566 final, 18.9.2008. . The Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) strongly supports the implementation of the multilingualism policy and its contribution to the EU 2020 strategy. Cooperation between the worlds of education, vocational education and training and work is one of its strategic priorities. Another priority is the promotion of the acquisition of key competences, including languages, throughout the education and training system In addition, the LLP supports learning mobility, including vocational training carried out in other Member States. Language learning is an important part of such training, both through linguistic and cultural preparation for traineeships abroad and language training ‘on the job’ Between 2000 and 2009, around 3000 Greek adults in continuous vocational training participated in such mobility actions .The figure does not include those at school under initial vocational training. . As from 2011, a network of business platform member organisations will be supported through the LLP with the aim to assist SME's to develop language strategies through an Internet platform and a series of awareness raising events and publications. On the policy side, the Commission established in 2009 a permanent business platform as a forum for exchange of best practices, gathering relevant information from the business community, social partners, trade organisations, chambers of commerce, trade promotion organisations, schools and education authorities. Within the strategic framework for European cooperation in education and training (ET 2020) Council conclusions of 12 May 2009: OJ C 119, 28.5.2009, p. 0002‑0010. , the Commission has also established a thematic working group with government experts from the Member States. The working group examines the links between language skills and employability and will deliver a report during the second half of 2011.
