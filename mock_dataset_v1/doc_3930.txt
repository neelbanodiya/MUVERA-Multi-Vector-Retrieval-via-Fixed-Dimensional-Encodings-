Joint answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-008072/11 , E-008299/11 , E-008319/11 (28 October 2011) The European Court of Justice (ECJ) by means of its ruling on the maize MON 810 pollen Decision of the ECJ of 6 September 2011 (Case C‑442/09) Karl Heinz Bablok v Freistaat Bayern. decided that pollen naturally present in honey constitutes an ingredient and as a result such pollen when produced from a genetically modified (GM) plant falls under the scope of the EU legislation for the authorisation of GMO products for food and feed uses Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed, OJ L 268, 18.10.2003. and should therefore be authorised accordingly. The current authorisation of the maize MON 810 focuses on particular food uses that do not include pollen. The Commission is examining how to fill in the existing regulatory gap. It must be stressed that MON 810 is an authorised GMO for more than 10 years, duly re-assessed by EFSA for several food uses in 2009 and considered to be safe for those uses. The Commission asked EFSA on 4 October 2011 to provide a statement specifically on the safety of MON810 pollen in honey. The Commission is conducting an in-depth analysis of the implications of the ruling on production of honey within the EU and import of honey from third countries. Another consequence concerns the organisation of the co-existence between beehives and GM fields, be they for commercial or research reasons. Coexistence is a responsibility of the Member States according to the EU legislation. The Commission is exploring ways to address these issues with the Member States. A first discussion took place at the Standing Committee of 22 September 2011, and a new discussion is scheduled at the meeting of the Standing Committee of 24 October 2011. The Commission also discussed on 30 September 2011 with stakeholders, including beekeepers, farmers' organisations and the food industry, to hear their concerns and queries. The ruling may also have an impact on the import of honey from third countries where GM crops, sometimes not authorised in the EU for cultivation or for food or feed use, are grown. The Commission is analysing further these impacts, and in this context held a meeting with the concerned Third Countries on 28 September 2011. An instrument on collective redress does not currently exist at EU level. At
