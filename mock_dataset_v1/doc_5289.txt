well as the commitment to promote the principle of 'design for all' in Community policies in the built environment; considers, nevertheless, that, in order to obtain tangible results, a more ambitious strategy must be developed; calls for the recommendations of the EU expert report on ‘Accessibility for All’ to be implemented without delay, including the revision of Construction Products Directive to require mandatory accessibility standards; thereby calls for EU measures to be accompanied together with an appropriate legislative framework laying down common rules on accessibility to goods, services and infrastructures and accompanied by incentives for business and the promotion of public/private partnerships; 16. Furthermore, recalls that assistive technologies, while playing an important role in facilitating the independence of persons with disabilities, can be prohibitively expensive for many disabled persons; many assistive devices are difficult to obtain, to maintain and repair; recalls the failure of the Handynet programme to meet the real needs of disabled persons and emphasises the need for EU policy to devote attention more specifically to furthering design-for-all policies; 17. Welcomes the adoption of rules on the accessibility of services, products and supplies in the new directives on public contracts recently adopted by the European Parliament and the Council; calls on the Commission to draw up guidelines for public bodies and local authorities to ensure that these rules are fully applied; 18. Welcomes the Commission proposal to encourage exchanges of good practice and identify factors of success or failure in relation to the full integration of people with disabilities in education and training; proposes that a working group be set up comprising representatives of the Member States, disabled people’s organisations, training and education experts, representatives of the two sides of industry, producers in the field of new technologies and other stakeholders; 19. Stresses the importance of the pilot project to follow up the European Year of People with Disabilities 2003 adopted in the European Parliament 2004 budget in order to promote mainstreaming of disability issues in the various European policies and encourage the development of partnerships between disabled people’s organisations and leading figures in economic, social and cultural life and the media; calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a specific action programme with effect from the 2005 budget; 20. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission, the Council and the governments of the Member States. 26 January 2004 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION
