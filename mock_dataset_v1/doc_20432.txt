Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (24 November 2011) IFRS are principle-based standards that leave entities a certain margin of appreciation in the application. Enforcement of the correct application of IFRS has to be examined on a case-by-case basis by auditors and the competent supervisory authorities of Member States. At the European level, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has the task (based on Articles 1.3 and 29.1 point c) of Regulation 1095/2010) OJ L 331, 15.12.2010. of coordinating the work of national supervisory authorities and fostering consistent application of supervisory practices across the European Union. The Commission fully supports ESMA in that role. As far as the accounting of exposures to sovereign debt is concerned, the Commission would refer the Honourable Members to the ESMA Statement of 28 July 2011 emphasising the need for appropriate disclosure of accounting treatment or exposure to sovereign debt.
