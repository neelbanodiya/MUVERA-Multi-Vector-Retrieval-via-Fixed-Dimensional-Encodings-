Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (4 June 2008) Regarding the case of Alimujiang Yimiti, the Commission has seen non governmental organisation (NGO) reports which confirm his arrest. It has therefore asked its services and Delegation in Beijing to investigate further on his case. Depending on the findings of this investigation, the Commission will consider whether to raise his case with the Chinese authorities. With regard to Wusiman Yiming, the Commission has been following his case since his arrest in November 2007. As you may be aware, the EU regularly raises individual cases, including on freedom of religion, through confidential démarches and by handing over a list of individual cases to the Chinese authorities in the framework of the Human Rights Dialogue. The Commission is committed to continue pressing the Chinese authorities to allow individuals in China to be guaranteed the right to practice their religion without any restrictions.
