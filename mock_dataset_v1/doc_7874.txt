Question for written answer E-011333/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Paul Murphy (GUE/NGL) (2 December 2011) Subject: Proposed motorcycle legislation (3) 1. In relation to the fifth paragraph of Article 40 and to the third paragraph of Article 43 of the Commission proposal, can the Commission say whether there is a difference between small-series type approval and individual type approval? The above paragraphs seem to differ as to whether an approval in one State will be automatically sanctioned as approved in another State. Can the Commission confirm that, where a small-series type approval or an individual approval for a vehicle is granted for an individual vehicle in one State, this approval automatically applies EU‑wide and not subject to additional approval processes in other States if the vehicle is sold/bought in another State? 2. Paragraph 3 of Article 41 states that ‘an individual approval shall apply to a particular vehicle whether it is unique or not’. Does this mean that, if a consumer purchases a large-manufacturer approved vehicle and subsequently wishes to customise this vehicle, he or she can choose to seek an individual approval for the modified bike in his or her State? If this is permitted, can the Commission provide details of the estimated cost, as well as the accessibility/availability, of such approval, in order to ensure that it is not prohibitive and does not restrict the individual’s rights to choose? 3. In relation to the third paragraph of Article 52, if specific after-market parts are designed for dual use for normal motorcycles, or for use only on race tracks or only off-road, how is it envisaged that the sale of such parts will be policed and restricted? Laws and manufacturers’ policies are already in place to brand such items (such as racing exhausts) as not legal for road use. The police are therefore already able to restrict the use of such parts on public roads, so why is there a need for further regulations?
