9999/C Q999 E/088 WRITTEN QUESTION P-1505/04 by Jan Mulder (ELDR) to the Commission (04 May 2004) Subject: Requirements in connection with payments from the FMD Fund in the Netherlands province of Friesland On the occasion of the most recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Friesland, the Administration of that Netherlands province established a special FMD Fund in order to provide financial support for farmers who had been seriously affected by the crisis and who could not hope to receive compensation from any other source. It now appears from documents emanating from the Friesland Province that payments from that Fund are made to the farmers affected only if they comply with the requirements of, inter alia, the Nitrates Directive (Directive 91/676/EC OJ L 375, 31.12.1991, p. 1 . ). Can the Commission confirm that this is a consequence of the requirements laid down by the European Commission with regard to the utilisation of this Fund?
