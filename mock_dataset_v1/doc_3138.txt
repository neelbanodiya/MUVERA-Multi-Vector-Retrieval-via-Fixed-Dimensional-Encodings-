Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (5 March 2008) The arrest of Hu Jia causes the Commission considerable concern given also the clear inference that he was arrested as a consequence of providing testimony to a meeting of Parliament in November 2007. The EU recently carried out a high-level demarche on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Beijing in this case. The EU asked first and foremost for his release. Failing this, the EU asked to receive information of the details of the charges and supporting evidence against him; confirmation that his detention is in accordance with international standards and that he is in receipt of the daily medication required for treatment of Hepatitis B, from which he suffers; confirmation of expected date of trial; and confirmation that he will in due course be granted conditional release prior to trial. The Commission is currently awaiting a reply to its demarche. The Commission will monitor very closely Mr Hu Jia’s case and if a constructive response is not received, the Commission will raise his case again. The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the trend of increasing repression of Human Rights defenders, which is a matter of deep concern. The EU has repeatedly called on China to moderate its approach to Human Rights defenders who exercise their right to speak freely and will continue to do so until the problem is addressed.
