Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (20 December 2010) The draft ‘Anti-Homosexuality Bill’, which was introduced into the Ugandan Parliament, but which has not been adopted yet, raises serious human rights issues, which are of great importance to the Commission. The Commission considers that the penalisation of homosexuality, as foreseen in the draft bill, goes against obligations under the UN human rights conventions to which Uganda has to abide by. The draft bill also goes against the EU‑supported UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity, of 18 December 2008. The EU Presidency and Heads of Mission in Uganda raised this issue with the Ugandan Government on several occasions, during meetings with the President, Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister of Justice, in Article 8 (Cotonou) meetings and with the Uganda Human Rights Commission. The Commission intends to keep pressure on the Ugandan Government in relation to the draft ‘Anti-Homosexuality Bill’ as well as other actions to persecute gay people in Uganda by raising this concern on every suitable occasion in dialogue with the government, as well as to support local human rights organisations in their efforts to change attitudes in the country and to improve the legal situation for gay people. The issue will stay on the agenda of the EU and Member State representatives in Uganda.
