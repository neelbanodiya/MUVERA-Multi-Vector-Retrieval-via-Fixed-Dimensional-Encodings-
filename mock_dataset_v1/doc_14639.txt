Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (29 October 2010) The Commission wishes to inform the Honorable Member that there are no specific EU funds available for wind turbine apprenticeships. However, on a related subject, one of the projects funded by the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme was to put in place a skills network for European wind energy. The final output of this project can be seen at: http://www.windskill.net/ Also and more generally, the European programme for vocational education and training, the so called Leonardo da Vinci programme, offers grants for work placements for trainees or people in the labour market to gain new skills. Besides, professionals in vocational education and training may take part in short work visits to learn from European colleagues. These exchanges contribute to their personal and professional development and they are able to learn new technologies and ways of working to bring back to their job in their home country. As regards industry organised traineeships and jobs, the European Wind Energy Association also provides a platform http://jobs.ewea.org/ . Moreover, the Commission services are aware of training opportunities offered by GL Garrad Hassan in a number of countries http://www.gl-garradhassan.com/en/Training.php and by the Irish Wind Energy Association http://www.iwea.com/index.cfm/page/_wind_skillnet .
