WRITTEN QUESTION E-2976/05 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (8 August 2005) Subject: Levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the food chain, with reference to E‑1895/05 and E‑1086/05 (Commission answers of 1 July 2005 and 4 May 2005) The Commission's answer of 1 July 2005 to Question E‑1895/05 indicates that the Commission considers it appropriate to maintain for a transitional period the existing maximum levels for dioxins and furans in foodstuffs and feed, in addition to setting new maximum levels for the sum of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs. That implies that, following the expiry of the transitional period, scheduled for 31 December 2007, only the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs will permanently apply and the current maximum levels for dioxins will no longer apply. 1. Why was the planned transitional period not already referred to in Mr Kyprianou's answer of 4 May 2005 on behalf of the Commission to Question E‑1086/05? 2. Am I right in assuming that, following the expiry of the abovementioned transitional arrangements for PCDD/F a batch of milk containing 5.5 pg WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ/g fat, of which 3.5 pg WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ/g fat, may be marketed? 3. Am I right in assuming that, following the expiry of the abovementioned transitional arrangements for PCDD/F, a batch of fish oil containing 22 ng WHO-PCDD/F-PCB-TEQ/kg, of which 10 ng WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ/kg, may be marketed? 4. Does this provide an incentive for storing feedingstuffs such as fish oils which at present cannot be marketed because of their high dioxin levels and placing them on the European market after 2007? 5. What risk communication strategy is the Commission planning to implement in order to make European consumers aware of the fact that a feedingstuff which cannot be marketed under the current EU rules on dioxins will be able to be marketed again as from 2007 and enter the food chain? 6. What evidence is there to support the Commission's assumption that such a measure will help strengthen consumer confidence — that has been lost — in the safety of foodstuffs? 7. When are the planned new maximum levels for the sum of dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs in foodstuffs and feed to become effective throughout the EU?
