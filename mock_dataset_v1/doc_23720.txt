the European Union ( COM(2004)0864 – C6 0180/2005 – 2004/0290(CNS)) Doc.: A6-0205/2005 Procedure : Consultation Debate : Vote : 05.07.2005 Parliament adopted the report by Paolo COSTA (ALDE, IT) on the Agreement on Maritime Transport between the European Community and its Member States and the People's Republic of China without amendment. Due to enlargement and the accession of ten new Member States to the EU, a Protocol must be agreed amending this agreement. This protocol is to be concluded by the EU Council which acts unanimously on behalf of the Member States. The Commission and the Chinese representatives in Brussels initiated this draft report in September 2004. Given the technical character of the document in question, Parliament could give its opinion without a plenary debate under Rule 131 of the Rules of Procedure.
