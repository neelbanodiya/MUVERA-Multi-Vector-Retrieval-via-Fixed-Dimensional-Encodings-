WRITTEN QUESTION P-2922/04 by Alfonso Andria (ALDE) to the Commission (12 November 2004) Subject: Public library lending rights The Commission has initiated infringement proceedings against a number of Member States (Portugal, France, Spain, Luxembourg, Ireland and Italy) for their failure to transpose Directive 92/100/EEC OJ L 346, 27.11.1992, p. 61 . on copyright, which made payment of royalties on books borrowed from public libraries compulsory in the countries of the Union. However, transposition of the Directive would seriously prejudice the dissemination of culture, since it would substantially penalise small local libraries, which constitute a very small but widespread network of ‘centres of knowledge’, which serve an essential social function, promote education and encourage reading, particularly among the youngest and least prosperous sections of the population. In Italy steps are being taken to make the general public, local authorities and relevant European institutions aware of the issue, and they include the collection of signatures against the introduction of compulsory charges for borrowing library books. Can the Commission say what steps it will take to avoid the adverse consequences of the proceedings it has initiated and whether it does not consider that the necessary changes should be made to the afore-mentioned legislation, which was adopted a long time ago and could now justifiably be considered as outdated and in any case in need of revision, with a view to a more flexible approach that would make allowance for the differing civic, social and cultural realities in the Union?
