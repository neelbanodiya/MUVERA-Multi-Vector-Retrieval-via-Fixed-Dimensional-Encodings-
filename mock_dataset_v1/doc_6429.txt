WRITTEN QUESTION P-3061/07 by Kyösti Virrankoski (ALDE) to the Commission (11 June 2007) Subject: Reimbursement of VAT in Poland Undertakings in the transport sector from EU Member States are entitled to reimbursement of VAT on purchases of fuel inter alia in other parts of the EU. Generally the reimbursement is paid within around six days. However, experience has shown that receipt of reimbursement is slow in Poland. For example, one Finnish transport company still has claims from 2004, in spite of using the services of the VAT agency Nikosax A/S Moms Agentur in Denmark. Several tax agents have come together in EFRA (the European Fiscal Representatives’ Association) which has enabled them to make progress, though only a little. The Polish authorities’ approach is inconsistent and unpredictable. For example there is a law which prohibits tax agents from contacting the funding ministry directly, and all contacts take place through a Polish third party. In the light of the above, what measures does the Commission propose to take to guarantee the functioning of the internal market, and to strengthen undertakings’ legal certainty in relation to the Polish tax authorities?
