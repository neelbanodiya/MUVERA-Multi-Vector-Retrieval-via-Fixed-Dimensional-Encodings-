Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (16 December 2011) The Commission has no data about the total costs of food waste generated in the EU per year. The Commission can only refer to research carried out in Member States such as UK and the Netherlands: — New estimates for household food and drink waste in the UK http://www.wrap.org.uk/retail_supply_chain/research_tools/research/report_new.html — WRAP, November 2011. indicate that throwing away avoidable food waste cost the UK consumers GBP 12 billion in 2010. — According to research in the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation, the Netherlands. Dutch consumers throw away about EUR 2.0 to 2.4 billion a year; approximately EUR 300 per household. Financial and environmental costs of management of food and kitchen waste vary significantly between Member States and for that reason they cannot be easily calculated. More detailed analysis of those costs can be found in Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the communication from the Commission on the ‘Future steps in bio-waste management in the European Union’ COM(2010) 235 final — SEC(2010) 577 final. .
