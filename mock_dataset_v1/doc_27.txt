of an environmental impact study, the information of the public and prior consultations with the public and other competent authorities. The environmental terms for the project were approved by Joint Ministerial decisions in 1996 (n° 82663) and in 1999 (n° 109155). In addition, given that the project was likely to have a significant effect on a proposed Site of Community Importance under Directive 92/43/EEC, the Commission has requested the Greek authorities to prepare a special complementary environmental study, in order to assess further the environmental impact of the Aposelemi dam. Although this was not legally required, since the project had been initiated in September 1994, i.e. before the deadline for Member States to transmit the national lists of proposed Sites of Community Importance, the Greek authorities have agreed to prepare such a study, which specifically assesses the impact of the project on the proposed site. Following this, additional measures have been foreseen to protect the fauna and the flora of the ecosystem. The approved funding decision requires the respect of the approved environmental terms, including the measures foreseen in the complementary study. It also includes special clauses to ensure the successful completion of the project by 31 December 2007.
