News Report : 23-10-2002 Brussels, 23 October 2002 Winner of 2002 Sakharov Prize The winner of the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought for 2002 was chosen on Wednesday 23 October by Parliament's Conference of Presidents. The winner is Mr Oswaldo José Paya Sardiñas, founder of a non-violent pro-democracy movement in Cuba. The President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, will award the prize at a formal sitting on 18 December during the plenary session in Strasbourg. This is the 15th anniversary of the Sakharov Prize. BIOGRAPHY Mr Oswaldo Jose Paya Sardiñas was born on 29 February 1952 in Havana, Cuba. As a result of his openly critical attitude towards the regime he has been arrested and imprisoned many times. In 1987 he founded the Christian Liberation Movement, a non-violent, non-denominational opposition movement, which has repeatedly called for profound political and economic changes towards democracy in Cuban society. Mr Paya Sardiñas currently steers a broad-based coalition of opposition organisations which have begun a signature drive (the Varela Project) for a national referendum for political and economic reform in the country that has already gathered more than 10,000 signatures. In May 2002 representatives of the "Todos Unidos" group delivered 11,020 voters' signatures, more than the number required to make the Varela Project a draft law under the Cuban Constitution, to the office of the National Assembly of People's Power. On 5 July 2002, the National Assembly's ordinary session was suspended "until further notice" by Fidel Castro. 23.10.2002 Conference of Presidents In the chair: Pat COX (ELDR, IRL) Press enquiries: Alexandre Stutzmann - tel.
