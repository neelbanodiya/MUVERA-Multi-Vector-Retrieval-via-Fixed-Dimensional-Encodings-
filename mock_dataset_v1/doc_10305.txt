Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (7 November 2011) Article 2 of Recommendation 2003/670/EC Commission Recommendation of 19 September 2003 concerning the European schedule of occupational diseases, OJ L 238, 25.9.2003, p. 28. , which is the only EU legislation relating to the recognition of occupational diseases, states that: ‘The Member States shall themselves determine the criteria for the recognition of each occupational disease in accordance with the national laws or practices in force.’ As a consequence, the Commission has no detailed information on the Member States that list occupational diseases as possibly being caused by exposure to pesticides. The EU has laid down rules on the use of hazardous chemicals such as pesticides to protect workers, the public and the environment in general. The protection of workers from risks related to chemicals is regulated in Directive 98/24/EC Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work, OJ L 131, 5.5.1998. . In addition, Directive 2004/37/EC Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work, OJ L 158, 30.4.2004. on carcinogens or mutagens regulates the high risks to the health of workers arising from their exposure to carcinogens and mutagens and includes prevention and reduction of exposure measures to protect workers health. As regards the use of pesticides, Directive 2009/128/EC Directive 2009/128/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 establishing a framework for Community action to achieve the sustainable use of pesticides, OJ L 309, 24.11.2009. provides for rules aiming at protecting pesticide users, the public and the environment from potential adverse effects. The existing rules appear to provide a high degree of protection of workers, including farmers, and the public. Therefore, the Commission sees no need to make any change at this stage.
