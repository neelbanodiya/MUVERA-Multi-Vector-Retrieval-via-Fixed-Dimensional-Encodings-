WRITTEN QUESTION E-2590/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (8 April 2009) Subject: Information on the use of grants for the ‘Drug Prevention and Information’ programme by the municipality of Pistoia Numerous financing programmes have been developed for the Community programming period 2007‑13; with these programmes the European Union intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. In this regard, the Commission has issued a call for proposals to select organisations that are eligible for a grant to involve civil society in the implementation and development of the European Union’s drugs strategy. The municipality of Pistoia (Tuscany, Italy) requires funding to prevent drug use, thereby helping to achieve the objectives of the EU’s drug prevention and information programme. In the light of the above, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Pistoia has submitted an application for said programme? If it has, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Pistoia has obtained the grants and whether they have been used in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether they have had to be reimbursed?
