calls on the Commission to make merit-based use of local- and European-based NGOs, in particular in cases where the management of projects and programmes by NGOs and international organisations (Multi-Donor Trust Funds) is more efficient and cost-effective than management by the Commission and where their activity generates projects that remain sustainable after the financial support has expired; urges the Commission to provide Parliament with clear information on the composition of NGO's own resources for specific projects which are partly financed by the EDF and by the NGOs themselves; 8. Highlights that development aid mechanisms should be also aimed at promoting wealth creation and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, since wealth creation remains a crucial tool in alleviating poverty; recalls that an estimated EUR 800 000 000 000 is lost annually from developing countries through illicit capital flows, prevention of which could prove decisive in alleviating poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals; Financial management of the EDFs 9. Notes that, in the Court of Auditors’ opinion, the Commission's report on the Financial Management of the 8th - 10th EDFs in 2009 ’presents an accurate description of the achievement of the Commission's operational objectives for the financial year (particularly concerning financial implementation and control activities)’, despite the negative impact of the economic crisis which has hit a large number of developing countries; 10. Underlines, however, that the Commission's follow-up of observations made by the Court of Auditors in a number of cases is inadequate (for example, the management of implementing organisations should be better supported, ex-ante checks should be improved by focusing more on keys risks and ’the functionalities of CRIS audit’ should be developed to enable a more efficient and effective monitoring of audit); stresses that the Commission's action on the Court of Auditors’ recommendations is an important element of accountability for the discharge authority; calls, therefore, on the Commission to inform Parliament's competent committees on the actions it has taken or plans to take to eliminate the shortcomings as mentioned by the Court of Auditors; 11. Is concerned at certain weaknesses identified by the Court of Auditors, in particular regarding public procurement procedures Paragraph IX, Court of Auditors’ Annual Report 2009 on the EDFs. , ex-ante controls in Delegations Point 30, Court of Auditors’ Annual Report 2009 on the EDFs. and partner countries’ internal control systems Point 5, Court of Auditors’ Annual Report 2009 on the EDFs. , and
