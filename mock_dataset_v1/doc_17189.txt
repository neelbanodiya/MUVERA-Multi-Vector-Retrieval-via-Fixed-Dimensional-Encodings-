Question for written answer E-003858/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Andreas Mölzer (NI) (19 April 2011) Subject: Fraud worth millions with scrap euro coins An instance of fraud involving scrap euro coins worth millions has recently been uncovered, in which tons of scrap euro coins were brought back to Germany from China with the aim of exchanging these ‘damaged’ coins at the Bundesbank. The gang responsible is assumed to have reassembled the copper cores and brass rings of the coins, which had previously been separated. According to media reports, the German Bundesbank usually uses a decoiner to scrap damaged coins, with the cores (the ‘pill’) being separated from the rings and rolled. This gives the coins an undulating surface, thus rendering them invalid. It is said to be very difficult to reuse coins which have this undulating shape. 1. In which Member States does decoining take place? What other ways exist of scrapping coins? 2. What is the value of the coins exchanged, and at which national banks were they exchanged? 3. What conclusions are being drawn at EU level from this instance of fraud?
