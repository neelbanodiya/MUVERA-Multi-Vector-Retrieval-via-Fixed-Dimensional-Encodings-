Question for written answer E-007594/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (29 July 2011) Subject: Turkish Christians deprived of their legal status In June 2011, Christian Turkish citizens reported that officials at registry offices were preventing non-Muslim citizens from engaging in the administrative process aimed at changing their religious status on identity cards. It was reported that the officials had threatened the citizens in question that abandoning Islam would cause them numerous difficulties from a social point of view. Many Christian citizens are therefore failing to formalise their change of religion on their documents and thus continue to be officially regarded as Muslims. Recently, an elderly lady who had died was unable to be buried in accordance with Christian tradition and has not even been allowed to have a cross on her grave, precisely because she had decided not to engage in the abovementioned administrative process due to the hostility shown by officials. In the light of these facts, does the Commission not agree that the actions of the Turkish authorities may be gradually depriving the non-Muslim communities of their own legal identity? Given that the Partnership Agreement between the EU and Turkey, adopted in 2008, lists several provisions which commit the Turkish Government to strengthening the protection of religious freedom, in particular by ensuring that non-Muslim citizens have equal rights in line with the principles of international law, does the Commission not think it should ask the Turkish Government for an explanation regarding these issues?
