been named as the N+2 rule , aims at and apparently is able to keep outstanding commitments for structural operations down to acceptable levels. 14. 2003 was the first year of N+2 decommitments for the programming period 2000-2006. The total amount decommitted under the N+2 rule was € 31.1 million (0.20% of the corresponding commitment tranche of 2000). Six Member States - Belgium, Denmark, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands (72% of the total amount decommitted) and Portugal - were affected by the decommitments. 15. So far, there have been two rounds (2003 and 2004) of N+2 decommitments, affecting the commitments made in 2000 and 2001. The total amount decommitted under the N+2 rule in 2004 was € 219.3 million. While this is more than 7 times the total decommitments made in 2004 (€31.1 million), the decommitments are still quite small in comparison with the average annual commitment instalment (around €30 billion). The decommitments made in 2004 account for 0.58% of the corresponding commitments of 2001. 16. In September 2005 (provisional data) n+2 decommitments amount to 299 million euro. The table below compares n+2 decommitments of 2003, 2004 and 2005. 2003 2004 2005 (until September, provisional data) Amount decommitted 31.1 million 219.3 million 299 million % of the annual instalment 0.20% 0.58% to be confirmed MS concerned PT, UK, IE, NL, BE, DK ES, DE, IT, PT, UK, FR, IE, NL, BE, AT ES, DE, IT, GR, PT, UK, FR, IE, NL, SE, BE, AT, DK The rapporteurs stress, however, that the payment claims from Member States normally arrive late in the year and, under the N+2 rule, even have a tendency to arrive just before the deadline. The final figure for decommitments for 2005 is therefore likely to come down as the last payment claims are introduced. 17. It is worth noting that this rule does not apply to the Cohesion Fund, the regulation for which does however contain a similar provision which takes account of the fact that this fund is used only to finance projects: any financial support granted for projects on which work has not commenced two years after the scheduled starting date must be cancelled. RAL 2005 (outstanding commitments/reste à liquider) 18. The total stock of RAL at the end of 2004 was €73,28 billion, which has, to date (Sept 05), risen to EUR 92,2 billion. As a comparison, at the end of 2003 the figure
