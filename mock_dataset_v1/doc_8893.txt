Question for written answer E-007687/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Rita Borsellino (S&D) (4 August 2011) Subject: Coal-fired power plant in Porto Tolle A large thermal power plant fired by fuel oil was built in Porto Tolle, in the heart of Italy’s Po delta, in the 1970s. The construction and operation of this plant had an enormous impact on the environment and health in one of the largest areas of environmental interest in Italy and even Europe (designated under EU legislation as a site of Community importance and a special protection area). In a ruling handed down on 27 April 2011, the Italian Court of Cassation found that air pollution legislation had been breached and that emissions from the thermal power station had caused serious damage. The court proceedings showed that ENEL SpA had failed to fit the power plant with anti-pollution technology. In the meantime, ENEL had decided to convert the Porto Tolle plant to coal rather than methane gas. Authorisation for the coal conversion project was granted under Act No 33/2009, a decision that was appealed by Italian environmental groups; in Ruling No 3107 of 23 May 2011, Council of State (Division VI) set aside the decree approving the project on environmental grounds. Article 35 (paragraphs 8 and 9) of the ‘Decree-Law containing urgent provisions for financial stabilisation’ was amended to allow the Porto Tolle plant to be converted to coal, irrespective of the Council of State’s ruling. There has thereby been a breach of the environmental impact assessment procedure provided for under EU legislation, including a provision (Article 5 of Directive 85/337/EEC) that the European Court of Justice has deemed to be one of the requirements from which national legislatures cannot derogate (Court of Justice of the European Communities, Sixth Chamber, 16.9.1999, No 435, Case C‑435/97). Does the Commission not think it needs to intervene to ensure compliance with EU environmental requirements and procedures?
