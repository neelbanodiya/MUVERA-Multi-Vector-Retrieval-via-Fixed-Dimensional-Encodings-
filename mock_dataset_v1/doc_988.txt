Question for written answer E-004291/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Bastiaan Belder (EFD) (5 May 2011) Subject: Access to subsidies from FIVA/the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) for Dutch fishermen sailing under the Belgian flag Is the Commission aware that Dutch fishermen who sail under the Belgian flag and have thus based their businesses in Belgium but are not resident there are denied subsidies from FIVA (the Financing Instrument for the Flemish Fishing and Aquaculture Industry) and the EFF? Pursuant to Article 3b of the Ministerial Decision of 14 July 1998 concerning support for investment and establishment in the fishing and aquaculture industry — an article inserted on 27 June 2003 and amended on 19 January 2006 — if such fishermen, either as natural persons or in the capacity of working partners/directors of a legal person, apply for subsidies, they have no access to the part of the subsidy financed by the Member State and consequently no access to the part of the subsidy from the EFF either. How compatible is the aforementioned Article 3b, which requires applicants to be resident in Belgium, with Criterion A.8 of the criteria for the assessment of initiatives and projects to implement Belgium’s EFF Operational Programme, which was approved by the supervisory committee on 8 July 2009? Criterion A.8 stipulates that fishing vessels must sail under the Belgian flag and have had economic ties with the coastal region in the three calendar years before the date of submission of the project in order to be eligible for an EFF subsidy. Does the Commission agree that, in view of the demonstrable economic ties which businesses must have with Belgium, inter alia in the form of sale of the catch, purchase of fishing equipment and materials, including fuel, and training of trainees from the Belgian fisheries college, in view of the fact that fishermen are liable to both corporate and personal taxation in Belgium (in the case of personal taxation by means of the ‘non-residents’ tax return form’) and also in view of the principles of the internal market, the requirement to be resident in the Member State is not a justified eligibility criterion for a subsidy from FIVA/EFF? Does the Commission agree that the additional requirement relating to residence of Belgium creates unequal rights, seriously discriminating against Dutch fishermen who form part of the Belgian fleet? Will the Commission ensure that fishing businesses can obtain non-discriminatory
