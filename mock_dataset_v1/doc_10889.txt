of individual redundant workers into employment; further stresses that the EGF assistance can co-finance only active labour market measures which lead to long-term employment; reiterates that assistance from the EGF must not replace actions which are the responsibility of companies by virtue of national law or collective agreements, nor measures restructuring companies or sectors; deplores the fact that the EGF might provide an incentive for companies to replace their contractual workforce with a more flexible and short-term one; 4. Notes that the information provided on the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded from the EGF includes information on the compatibility and complementarity with actions funded by the Structural Funds; reiterates its call to the Commission to present a comparative evaluation of those data in its annual reports as well; 5. Welcomes the fact that following repeated requests from Parliament, for the first time the 2011 budget shows payment appropriations of EUR 47 608 950 on the EGF budget line 04 05 01; recalls that the EGF was created as a separate specific instrument with its own objectives and deadlines and that it therefore deserves a dedicated allocation, which will avoid there being transfers from other budget lines, as happened in the past, which could be detrimental to the achievement of the various policies objectives; 6. Welcomes the foreseen reinforcement of the EGF budget line 04 05 01 by EUR 50 000 000 through Amending budget No 3/2011, which will be used to cover the amount needed for this application; 7. Approves the decision annexed to this resolution; 8.
