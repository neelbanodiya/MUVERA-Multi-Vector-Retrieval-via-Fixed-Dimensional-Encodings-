any natural or legal person may request Commission departments to have access to agendas under the public access rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents OJ L 145, 31.5.2001. . When requests are made under this regulation, a decision is taken upon assessment on a case-by-case basis in order to ascertain that their disclosure would not harm protected interests or that such interests are outweighed by an overriding public interest in disclosure. The Commission is committed to improving the quality and reliability of data included in the Register for all groups, notably trough regular updates. The Commission may invite on an ad hoc basis experts with specific competence in a subject on the agenda to take part in the work of the group or sub-group. As these experts are not members, their names are not published in the Register, but may be requested to the responsible Commission department.
