Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (23 July 2010) Annex A to Commission Decision 2006/766/EC Commission Decision 2006/766/EC of 6 November 2006 establishing the lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, marine gastropods and fishery products are permitted, OJ L 320, 18.11.2006, last amended by Commission Decision 2009/951/EU of 14 December 2009, L 328, 15.12.2009. establishes lists of third countries and territories from which imports of bivalve molluscs, echinoderms, tunicates, and marine gastropods are permitted. However, according to Article 1 of this decision, the annex does not apply to the adductor muscles of pectinidae other than aquaculture animals, completely separated from the viscera and gonads. This very specific commodity may also be imported from third countries that are not listed in Annex I. Imports are authorised and will continue to be authorised, if in compliance with the EU requirements laid down in the regulation laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin, Chapter IX of Section VII of Annex III, L 139, 30.4.2004, last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1161/2009 of 30 November 2009, L 314, 1.12.2009. . By granting a new transitional period for the United States' competent authorities, the EU renewed its longstanding proposal to undertake a comparison of both production systems and determine their equivalence. This proposal has been finally taken up by the United States' authorities but, as an unfortunate consequence of their late engagement, the equivalence exercise could not be completed by the 1 July 2010 deadline granted by the Member States. It is premature to predict the ultimate conclusions of the ongoing equivalence exercise, which is a complex task. The respective control systems differ substantially on important points such as the methodology used to classify and control the mollusc harvesting areas or the methods employed to monitor potential microbial contaminants and bio-toxins. Only under the condition of a favourable outcome, can the United States be placed on the list of third countries from which imports of live bivalve molluscs and certain fishery products derived from molluscs into the EU are authorised. Vice versa, the Member States may become eligible to export their EU‑compliant products to the United States.
