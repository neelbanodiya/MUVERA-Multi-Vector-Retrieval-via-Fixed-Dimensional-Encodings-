Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (4 December 2009) Although the feedback received from the complainant (EBB — European Biodiesel Board) has so far been positive, at this stage it is premature to draw any conclusions on the effectiveness of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed recently on imports of biodiesel originating in the United States (US) See Commission Regulation (EC) No 193/2009 of 11 March 2009 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of biodiesel originating in the United States of America, Commission Regulation (EC) No 194/2009 of 11 March 2009 imposing a provisional countervailing duty on imports of biodiesel originating in the United States of America, OJ L 67, 12.3.2009, Council Regulation (EC) No 598/2009 of 7 July 2009 imposing a definitive countervailing duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of biodiesel originating in the United States of America, and Council Regulation (EC) No 599/2009 of 7 July 2009 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of biodiesel originating in the United States of America, OJ L 179, 10.7.2009. . However, the available statistics (Eurostat and US export statistics) show that after provisional measures were imposed in March 2009, there has been a significant decrease of US biodiesel which entered the Community market (an average decrease of around 75 % depending on the type of biodiesel imported). The aim of the measures is to eliminate trade distorting effects caused by injurious dumping and/or subsidisation and not to foreclose the Community market to imports. Depending on the type of biodiesel, the main import sources are Argentina, Brazil, Russia and the US. More detailed information concerning production, production capacity and market share was collected and verified during the investigations and is provided on a global basis in the regulations imposing the antidumping and countervailing duties. This information concerned the investigation period (IP) as defined for the proceedings (April 2007 to March 2008). The Commission does not continue its investigation after the imposition of definitive measures and, therefore, does not collect nor update this detailed information after the IP. It is also noteworthy that in the investigations concerning biodiesel sampling techniques were used to analyse the injury to the Community industry. Hence, all the injury indicators mentioned in the regulations which imposed provisional and definitive measures are those established on the basis of a representative sample of
