WRITTEN QUESTION E-0294/05 by Mario Borghezio (IND/DEM) to the Commission (2 February 2005) Subject: Identification of European tsunami victims as a priority for the EU Almost a month after the tsunami in Southeast Asia it now seems clear that a very large number of bodies of unidentified Westerners have been buried, even if only temporarily, in mass graves in accordance with procedures which make identification very difficult. For example, it has been reported in the past few days (Le Figaro, 18.1.2005) that in Thailand there is a provisional death toll of 5313 , 1354 of whom are foreigners and 1790 Thai nationals; in the case of the remaining 2159 , no-one is in a position to say whether they are Westerners or local victims. Will the EU, as Interpol has asked, make it a short-term priority to designate and send experts to identify the European victims of the tsunami?
