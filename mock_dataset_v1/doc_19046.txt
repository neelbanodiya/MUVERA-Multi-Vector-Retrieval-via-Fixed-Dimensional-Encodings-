ORAL QUESTION H-0355/06 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Paulo Casaca to the Commission Subject: Use of chemical weapons in repressive action against Sufis in Iran According to a complaint received by Amnesty International and the European Parliament, the Iranian authorities used chemical weapons in the attack they carried out against the Sufi sacred shrine in the city of Qom in February of this year. Will the Commission clarify whether it has already investigated this claim? Will it clarify whether it also considers this action to constitute 'excessive use of force', as it did in the case of the genocide of ethnic Arabs in Ahwaz?
