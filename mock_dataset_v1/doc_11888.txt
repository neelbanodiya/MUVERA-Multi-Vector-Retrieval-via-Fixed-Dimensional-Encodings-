Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2011) Article 10 paragraph 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides that ‘Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This right includes freedom to change religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or in private, to manifest religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance’. However, according to its Article 51 paragraph 1, the provisions of the Charter are addressed to the Member States only when they are implementing Union law. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, it does not appear that the matter referred to is related to the implementation of EC law. In that matter it is thus for Member States alone to ensure that their obligations regarding fundamental rights — as resulting from international agreements and from their internal legislation — are respected. Therefore, the Commission is not in a position to comment further on facts as described by the Honourable Member.
