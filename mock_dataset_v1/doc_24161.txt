WRITTEN QUESTION E-3740/08 by Jim Higgins (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (4 July 2008) Subject: Age restrictions on car-hire services Could the Commission indicate whether it is concerned that car-hire companies operate a restrictive and discriminatory age policy when it comes to hiring cars, as many companies will not hire a car to someone under the age of 25. Does the Commission agree that this simply amounts to tarring all under‑25s with the same brush, i.e. saying they are unsafe drivers?
