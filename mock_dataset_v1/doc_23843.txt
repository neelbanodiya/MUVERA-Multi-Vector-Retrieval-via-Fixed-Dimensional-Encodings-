Question for written answer E-003031/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (29 March 2011) Subject: Violent unrest in Yemen According to the online edition of Kathimerini of 15 March, over thirty people have died in fighting between anti-government and pro-government forces during demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The people of Yemen are rising up in protest against poverty in the country. As reported in the press, Yemen suffers from widespread corruption, massive unemployment and poverty, with 40 % of the population living on USD 2 a day or less and one-third suffering from chronic malnutrition; combined with the fact that the current President of Yemen has ruled the country for the past 32 years, EU citizens have good reason to wonder what legitimacy he might have. In view of the above, will the Commission say: — Does it believe that there is momentum for a new political era to begin in Yemen? — What moves does it intend to take to ensure that popular demands meet with a peaceful response and that further violence in the country is avoided?
