optimise its impact and its benefits to society, broadband deployment should be coupled with demand-awareness information and educational programmes; 11. Notes the difficulty in meeting the Europe 2020 broadband targets, given consumer, business and public-sector financial resources; calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure the use of infrastructure by third parties, ensure non-discrimination, promote available technologies and prevent measures placing unfair burdens on consumers and business, particularly as regards universal obligations; considers that public-private partnerships and public investment, including from the structural funds, should be used where necessary to deploy broadband and enhance access to high-speed internet; 12. Calls on Member States, the Commission and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), in consultation with the relevant public authorities, to facilitate public-private partnerships and deploy other European funding instruments, including ERDF, EAFRD and EBRD funds; welcomes the Commission’s plans to add European Investment Bank loans with low interest rates to the list of subsidy instruments; 13. Maintains that the strong demand for connectivity, which simultaneously boosts the profile of the EU online economy, contributes to EU network readiness and responds to the societal changes taking place within the single market, should be backed by the appropriate funds and solid competition infrastructure needed for realisation of the European Broadband project; 14. Acknowledges the slow absorption of monies from the structural funds for broadband infrastructure investment, and the need for guidance on the use of these funding instruments; calls for a thorough analysis of such instruments in order to identify and remove bottlenecks that are deterring Member States and regions from using them; 15. Believes that extending broadband access to rural and remote areas, where market incentives are lower, plays an important role in geographic and social cohesion, making territories more attractive and companies more competitive; considers that public support should prioritise the roll-out of broadband infrastructure to such areas; 16. Requests the Commission and BEREC to collect and collate annually data on broadband (speed and quality) specifications and the choice available to consumers and business in different Member States, as well as the progress towards implementation of the EU telecoms framework and the Recommendation on NGA; 17. Notes that new fibre-optics networks offer consumers high-quality access at consistently higher speeds than existing technology; believes that it would be expedient to prioritise the development of fibre-optics-based broadband in areas where it represents the most economic and sustainable
