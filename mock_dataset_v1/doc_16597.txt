Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (9 April 2008) The Honourable Member will find the figures requested in the table below: Status/Contract 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Officials 18 343 18 603 19 977 20 928 21 519 22 281 Temporary agents 2 829 2 409 1 527 1 463 1 215 1 542 Auxiliary agents 1 930 2 526 2 303 1 222 258 0 Contract agents 0 0 733 2 085 5 090 5 512 Special advisers 39 30 8 46 55 43 SCOPE: The figures given above represent staff in activity on 1 January of each year. The number of temporary agents decreased between 2003 and 2007, as around 2 500 of them (mostly on research credits) became officials. The 2004 and 2007 enlargements, resulting in the recruitment of EUR‑12 nationals, also contributed to an increase in numbers of officials between 2004 and 2008, and to an increase in the number of temporary agents between 2007 and 2008. The category of ‘contract agents’ was first created through the reform of the Staff Regulations in May 2004. Contract agents have replaced auxiliaries, as well as many staff formerly employed under national law contracts in delegations, representations and Commission crèches. Special Advisers include staff as defined in Article 5 of the Conditions of employment of other servants of the European Communities. Special advisers do not work full time for the Commission, but in most cases only for a limited number of days each year. Employees under national law are managed separately by each service; the Commission is working on centralised data. They will be provided to the Honourable Member as soon as they are available.
