limits or recovery plans for stocks outside safe biological limits was introduced with the 2002 CFP reform. Recovery plans usually lay down the conditions under which these could be replaced by management plans as soon as recovery targets had been reached. These initial plans were largely based on biomass rebuilding targets from poor to more sustainable levels. Today, as we have been able to move from biomass to fishing mortality targets on the basis of scientific advice, harvest control rules that encompass both recovery and management scenarios can be set. In practice, scientists' advice on both fishing mortality targets and harvest control rules aiming to reach the stocks maximum sustainable yield that in theory is the largest catch that can be taken from a stock over an indefinite period. In this context, a comprehensive evaluation of the recovery plan, including reviewing the fishing effort limitation, by both ICES and the STECF (the Scientific, Technical, and Economic Committee for Fisheries) is foreseen for 2010. A benchmark assessment by ICES followed by an evaluation of the plan will take place in the first months of 2010. ICES will review the biological reference points and evaluate the plan, while the STECF will advise on appropriate management measures and their socioeconomic impact (subject to the availability of data). Following these evaluations, the Commission's services will conduct an impact assessment with a view to propose a revised plan in the second half of 2010.
