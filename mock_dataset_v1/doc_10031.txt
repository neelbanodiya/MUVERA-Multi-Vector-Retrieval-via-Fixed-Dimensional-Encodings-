WRITTEN QUESTION P-5624/07 by Mario Borghezio (UEN) to the Commission (9 November 2007) Subject: Islamic terrorism: is Europe resorting to self-censorship? In a document containing many sections treated as classified information (5469/3/07, REV 3 EXT 1, 1 June 2007) the Council has laid down ‘guidelines’ of sorts on the terminology to be used when communicating on the subject of terrorism, with particular reference to Islamic terrorism.

Does it not believe that this verbal hypocrisy, peremptorily proposed — not to say imposed — by a European institution, also marks a retreat from the attitude of firmness and moral commitment that has found expression, first of all in the European Parliament, in the wake of the tragic events that
