ORAL QUESTION H-0312/04 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jonas Sjöstedt to the Council Subject: Relations with Turkey Violations of the Christian minority's human rights persist. The rights of individuals freely to practise their religion and use their own language are, in practice, restricted. Old churches and monasteries fall into ruin or are deliberately destroyed. The Turkish authorities continue to deny the genocide of Armenians and Syrians at the beginning of the previous century. How does the Council intend to raise the question of the oppression of Armenians and Syrians in Turkey in its contacts with that country with its possible membership of the EU in view?
