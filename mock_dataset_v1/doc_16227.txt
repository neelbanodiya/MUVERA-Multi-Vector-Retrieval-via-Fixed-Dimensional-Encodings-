Question for written answer E-011349/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Vladko Todorov Panayotov (ALDE) (2 December 2011) Subject: Food quality Recent debates in the EP have highlighted the fact that large food corporations are producing products of varying quality across Europe. For example, Coca-Cola and Nescafe use different ingredients for their products in different countries. Generally, products seem to be of lower quality in some areas, particularly in eastern Europe. This issue demonstrates the continuing need for transparency in respect of ingredients and food quality, but does the Commission have a defined stance as regards the EU playing a further role in regulating food products? Does the Commission plan to address these differences in food quality?
