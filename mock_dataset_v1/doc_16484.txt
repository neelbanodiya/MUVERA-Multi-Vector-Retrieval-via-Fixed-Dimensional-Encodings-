ORAL QUESTION H-0489/05 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Jan Andersson to the Commission Subject: Stimulating demand in the EU economy Economic growth in the EU is extremely weak in comparison with Asia and the USA. Economic policy within the EU is almost entirely focused on enhancing supply. There is almost no attempt to stimulate demand. Yet the EU market is bigger that that of the USA, and it should be possible to coordinate efforts to boost not only supply but also demand. Does the Commission share this view? If so, what does the Commission plan to do to stimulate demand in the EU economy?
