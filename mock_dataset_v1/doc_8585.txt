ORAL QUESTION H-0919/06 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Commission Subject: Prevention of marine pollution by discharges from shipping In contravention of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (1973) and the Protocol thereto (MARPOL 1977/78), the Greek Government, under Presidential Decree 400/1996 (A'268), introduced a deadline of over five years for the installation of waste collection systems on passenger vessels, extended for a further four years under Presidential Decree 374/2002 (A'321). While all shipowners should have complied with this requirement by 31 December 2005, the Greek Government, in Document 1576 of 31 July 2006, put forward a draft presidential decree amending Presidential Decree 374/2002 (Official Gazette 321 A') regarding 'compliance by vessels with the provisions of paragraph 2 of Presidential Decree 400/1996 (Official Gazette 268 A')' and submitted the proposal to the Council of State, which ruled that the proposal regarding a two-year extension of the deadline contained in the draft presidential decree 'had not been tabled through the proper legal channels', revealing that the Greek Government was covering up for shipping companies polluting the marine environment and concealing the dangers to public health. How many vessels have failed to comply with the provision regarding the compulsory installation of waste collection systems? What measures will the Commission take to implement the relevant international legislation concerning the protection of public health and the marine environment?
