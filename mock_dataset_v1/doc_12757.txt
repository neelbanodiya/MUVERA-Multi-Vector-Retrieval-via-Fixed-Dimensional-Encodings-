WRITTEN QUESTION E-2028/07 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (16 April 2007) Subject: Community law and professional sport While the EC Treaty contains no specific reference to sport, many of the Treaty articles and EU policies are regarded as applicable to professional sport. Can the Commission indicate whether professional sport as an economic activity is subject to competition legislation, given that the ‘dominant position’ enjoyed by certain football teams is being consolidated by the current system of television fees. Does the Commission consider that this might be resolved by means of the arrangements applicable in the USA imposing an upper limit on team expenditure, for example by means of a salary cap? More generally, is it envisaging action to ensure that UEFA and FIFA rules do not infringe Community law?
