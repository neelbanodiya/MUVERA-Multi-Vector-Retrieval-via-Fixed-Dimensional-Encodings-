possible to increase both the capacities of the EU's partners and local appropriation; 43. Notes that aid reform is only one of the steps that the EU must take along with making its trade, security, migration, agriculture, fisheries, energy, environment, climate change and other policies coherent with development objectives in order to benefit developing countries and promote a fair international financial and trade system in favour of development; recalls in this connection Paragraph 35 of the European Consensus for Development, which states that 'it is important that non-development policies assist developing countries' efforts in achieving the MDGs'; 44. Recalls the commitments given by countries which are signatories to the Paris Declaration to perform strategic environmental assessments at sectoral and national level; calls on the Commission, therefore, to respect this objective with a view to assessing the impact of its policies, particularly on climate change, desertification and biodiversity in developing countries; 45. Stresses that efforts to render aid effective should be accompanied by better information for the citizens of donor countries regarding the aims, methods of implementation and recipients of development aid; 46. Recalls that the European Consensus for Development recognises gender equality as a goal in its own right, and therefore should be a key area for discussion on aid effectiveness; 47. Recognises that the agendas of aid quantity and aid quality are inextricably linked, and that for aid effectiveness targets to be met, there must be continued commitment to existing quantity targets as agreed to by all EU Member States; in that regard urges the Commission and the Member States to reconfirm their commitment to achieving their collective target for ODA of 0,56% of GNI in 2010 and 0,7% of GNI in 2015, to scale up aid and to set ambitious multi-annual timetables to measure the gradual rise in aid budgets; 48. Stresses the importance of including a strong gender perspective at every stage of the programming, implementation, monitoring and evaluation levels; 49. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, and the national parliaments of the Member States.
