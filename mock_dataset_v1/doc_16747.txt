Question for written answer E-8705/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (26 October 2010) Subject: River basin management plans in Greece The Greek Government has financed the drawing-up of proposals for river basin management plans in accordance with Article 13 of the Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:263598-2010:TEXT:EL:HTML . However, it has done so without the monitoring of surface and groundwater status having previously being undertaken, in compliance with Article 8 of the directive. No data — particularly biological data — are available which can serve as a basis for the completion of the above plans. Since no monitoring network yet exists, it is not possible to evaluate the effectiveness of any measures or projects that have been undertaken. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Does it agree to the financing of measures in a Member State which fails to meet essential criteria regarding the physical object targeted by individual actions? 2. What measures does it intend to take to ensure the effective use of EU resources in this case?
