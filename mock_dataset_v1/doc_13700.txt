WRITTEN QUESTION P-3146/09 by Zdzisław Kazimierz Chmielewski (PPE‑DE) to the Council (27 April 2009) Subject: Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy — COM(2008)0721 Work on the EP's opinion on the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy (COM(2008)0721) has now largely been completed. Although a number of promising and useful solutions were put forward in that document and the amendments thereto, fishermen in the South Baltic area remain concerned and have asked me to table a question to the Council. Our question concerns the financial resources required for the transmission of electronic data on catches. The fishermen believe that, unless additional funding is forthcoming, many Member States will be unable to fulfil this requirement. The monies made available to date from the European Fisheries Fund fail to cover the costs arising from the daily electronic reporting requirement.
