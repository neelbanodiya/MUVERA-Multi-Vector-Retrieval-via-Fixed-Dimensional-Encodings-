Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (25 July 2011) The Commission thanks the Honourable Member for raising the issue of entry bans for representatives of the Belarusian regime. 1. The presence of political prisoners in the heart of Europe in the 21st century is unacceptable. Commissioner Füle responsible for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy and High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton have repeatedly and unambiguously condemned the detention, trials and sentencing on political grounds of representatives of civil society, the independent media and the political opposition, including former presidential candidates. They have also called for the immediate and unconditional release and rehabilitation of all those detained on political grounds and for the end of harassment of democratic forces, independent media, civil society and those defending them (see enclosed a list of prisoners convicted on political grounds in Belarus, as received from the EU Delegation in Minsk on 24 June 2011 The annex is sent directly to the Honourable Member and to Parliament's Secretariat. .) 2. On 31 January 2011, the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) decided to impose an entry ban and an asset freeze against persons http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:028:0017:0031:EN:PDF responsible for the violations of electoral standards and the subsequent crackdown. The list has subsequently been enlarged by the FAC on 21 March http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:076:0013:0031:EN:PDF , on 23 May http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:136:0048:0051:EN:PDF and on 20 June 2011 http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:161:0001:0006:EN:PDF http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:136:0087:0090:EN:PDF . The Foreign Affairs Council on 20 June 2011 decided to also freeze the assets of three companies linked to business interests within the regime 5 ; to impose an embargo on Belarus on arms and on materials that might be used for internal repression; and to take a restrictive approach to lending to Belarus by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and by the European Investment Bank. The EU has made clear that the release and rehabilitation of the detainees would be an essential element for a review of its decision on sanctions. The Honourable Member may rest assured that the issue of political prisoners is high on the EU agenda, and that it will continue intense efforts to seek to ensure their liberation and rehabilitation.
