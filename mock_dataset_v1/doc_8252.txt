Question for written answer E-003716/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Petru Constantin Luhan (PPE) (14 April 2011) Subject: Daphne III programme 2007‑13 According to Commission Decision C(2010)8651, by 31 May 2012 the Commission must propose arrangements for continuing the programme. In 2011, as in previous years, the projects must concern the rights of victims, combating the violence associated with mutilation practices, and violence in the media. Against the current background of economic difficulty, from which many families are suffering, domestic violence can sometimes occur and many people in such a situation can begin to have mental health problems and even become violent. Will the Commission include in the future Daphne programme support for victims of violence generated by the current economic problems?
