comes from the taxation component of domestic prices and need not be transferred into the price of exports. Moreover, there is no evidence so far of an adverse wage-price spiral that could push unit labour costs higher. Wages are expected to slow down markedly to close to zero growth rates. In 2010, a downward adjustment in nominal wage growth is supported by the cuts in the public sector wage bill (Easter, summer and Christmas bonuses and allowances) and the recent collective agreement on freezing the minimum wage in the private sector. However, high inflation, in the context of a severe recession, provides evidence of inflexible domestic markets, which has an impact on the households’ real disposable income. The Economic Adjustment Programme for Greece as negotiated with staff from the Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) addresses these market rigidities in a number of areas already starting in 2010 (such as implementing the Services Directive Directive 2006/123/EC of the European and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market, OJ L 376, 27.12.2006. , liberalising road freight transport, the wholesale electricity market, reforming private sector wage bargaining and contractual agreements). These are medium-to long-term reforms that will put the Greek economy on a sustainable footing; their full impact may not unfold in the very short run.
