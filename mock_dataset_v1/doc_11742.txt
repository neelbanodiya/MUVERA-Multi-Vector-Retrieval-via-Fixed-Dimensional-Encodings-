with the applicable rules. The Solidarity Fund is applicable to cases of forest fires if the conditions in the Solidarity Fund Regulation for mobilising the Fund are met. The Fund has in the past been mobilised for forest fire applications and it will be mobilised for a recent forest fire application from Greece. As regards the thresholds for mobilising the Fund, in order to qualify as a major disaster in the sense of Article 2 (2) of the Solidarity Fund Regulation, the total direct damage caused by the disaster must in any case exceed EUR 3 billion (at 2002 prices) or 0.6 % of the country's gross national income, whichever is the lower. The threshold applicable to Italy (in 2007) was EUR 3.267 billion. Assistance may also be granted when the major part of the population of a specific region is affected by a disaster with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region. In April 2005, the Commission presented to Parliament and the Council its proposal for a revised Solidarity Fund Regulation, whose key elements are (1) an enlarged scope, to enable the Community to react to disasters other than of natural origin, (2) the provision for advance payments, to accelerate the rate of response and the visibility of Union support, and (3) a simplification, by introducing clearer criteria for the activation of the Fund. The proposal was very favourably received by Parliament but so far no progress has been made in the Council.
