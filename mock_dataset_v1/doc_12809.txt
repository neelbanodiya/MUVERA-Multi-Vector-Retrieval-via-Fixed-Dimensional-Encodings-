Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (3 March 2010) The remarks on page 198 of the 2008 annual report of the Court of Auditors concern errors made by beneficiaries of grants under the sixth framework programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities (FP6). As indicated in the annual report of the Court of Auditors, the risk of the overstatement of costs by the beneficiaries is largely due to the inherent complexity of funding mechanisms provided by the applicable regulatory framework, which are based on reimbursement of actual costs. This limits the scope of desk reviews that can reasonably be made before reimbursement of expenditure, and many of these errors can only be detected by an audit at the premises of the beneficiaries. The Commission has therefore put a control strategy in place, which foresees that the Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry will perform 407 audits during the years 2007‑10. The audited beneficiaries will include: (1) the approximately 160 contractors that are receiving the highest amounts of FP6 funding; (2) a random sample of 161 audits from the remaining population and (3) a sample of beneficiaries who present a specific risk, or beneficiaries from the two first groups for which a previous audit recommended a follow-up audit to ensure that the beneficiary correctly implemented the results of the initial audit. For the Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry this final category represents 76 audits. One objective of the strategy is to ‘clean’ 50 % of the FP6 budget from systematic errors at the end of the implementation of the strategy. Under FP6, the Directorate-General for Enterprise and Industry manages 223 research projects, performed by 1 289 beneficiaries. Some beneficiaries are involved in several projects, and therefore the number of participants is 1 786, for a total grant amount of EUR 328 855 186. The Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry is currently preparing information to submit to the Court of Auditors on the situation at 31 December 2009. Although these figures are still under analysis, it can be anticipated that the data will show that 351 audits were carried out by 31 December 2009 over 520 participations, for a total EU grant amount of EUR 103 183 897. This means that by 31 December 2009, the Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry has audited 27 % of its beneficiaries, and 31.4 % of total EU
