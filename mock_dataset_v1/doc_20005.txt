WRITTEN QUESTION E-1080/09 by Jim Higgins (PPE-DE) to the Commission (26 February 2009) Subject: Human rights and religious toleration in Sri Lanka Despite pledges by the new Sri Lankan Government to uphold religious freedom, the Anti-Conversion Bill continues its journey through Parliament. Could the Commission please clarify whether it has taken any action to urge Sri Lanka not to adopt this bill, which will violate Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?
