Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (16 September 2008) 1. According to information received from the Greek authorities, a first call for the project for the delivery of childcare services has already been issued under the 2007‑13 Human Resources Development operational programme in early July 2008, while a first call for the project for the delivery of help-at-home services is expected to be issued before the end of 2008 under the five regional operational programmes for 2007‑13. According to the same information, there is a commitment of the Greek authorities to finalise the necessary arrangements in order to allow a smooth transition to the new system and a timely start of the new projects. 2. During the 2007‑13 programming period, the Structural Funds will continue to support the delivery of social services linked to the development of employment and cohesion. However, this will be done under new institutional frameworks already adopted by Greece and which focus on granting assistance to beneficiaries individually rather than for the part-financing of the operation of social structures, as was the case under the 2nd and 3rd Community support frameworks. According to the Greek National Strategic Reference Framework 2007‑13, the Human Resources Development operational programme and the regional operational programmes, the financing of the operation of the social structures will become an exclusively Greek State responsibility. It is up therefore to Greece to make sure that the country's mountain, rural and island areas are covered adequately by social structures. 3. As social services will continue to be provided during the 2007‑13 programming period, the majority of those employed under projects for the delivery of social services are not expected to risk losing their jobs. However, the Commission stresses that this issue is the exclusive responsibility of the Greek State. 4. This issue is the exclusive responsibility of the Greek State.
