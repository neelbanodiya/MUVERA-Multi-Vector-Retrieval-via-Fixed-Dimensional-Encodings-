Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (18 December 2006) The Commission would like to recall that freedom of association, thought and expression constitute essential foundations of a democratic society. According to the European Convention on Human Rights, the exercise of these freedoms shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society. The Commission would also point out that under the EC and EU Treaties, it does not have general powers with respect to fundamental rights; it can only act in cases of violations of these rights in the framework of EC law. In this context, the matter invoked by the Honourable Member concerning an association called the Communist Youth Union in the Czech Republic falls, on the basis of the information available to the Commission, outside the scope of application of Community law. In the light of the foregoing, it is thus for the Czech authorities to ensure that fundamental rights in the case in question are fully respected.
