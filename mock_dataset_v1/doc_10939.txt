ORAL QUESTION H-0411/04 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Bart Staes to the Commission Subject: Mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo On 26 October 2004, Amnesty International published a report on mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC-EU strategy paper, 'Cooperation strategy and indicative programme 2003-2007', likewise refers to this. The social, political and economic situation in the DRC is said to be having an 'extremely negative impact' on human rights. Can the Commission state what lasting practical results its financial contributions in the field of health and restoration of the rule of law in the DRC as described in its strategy paper have so far had on the ground, and can it accordingly indicate whether there is still an urgent need to make resources available from intervention budget (B) specifically with a view to providing physical and psychological care for the thousands of rape victims?
