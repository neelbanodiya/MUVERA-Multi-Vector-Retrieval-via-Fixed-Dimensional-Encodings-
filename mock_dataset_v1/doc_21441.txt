Question for written answer P-004959/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Bernd Lange (S&D) (17 May 2011) Subject: Economic sanctions against Libya Tamoil operates in the petrol station sector in the European Union, under the name of HEM in Germany, with links to the group's own Holborn refineries, which mainly process Libyan oil. Holborn is based in Cyprus. The companies form part of the Netherlands concern Oilinvest (Netherlands) B.V. Group, which belongs to the Libyan national oil company (NOC) and has close business relations with it. On the basis of the current legal position (Council Regulation (EU) No 204/2011 of 2 March 2011), the sanctions against Libya include the Libyan state oil company NOC, and there are therefore restrictions on its business activity. However, despite the sanctions, Tamoil petrol stations have been able to continue to supply fuel at below‑average prices. 1. What evidence does the Commission have that the sanctions are being complied with and that the Holborn refineries are not continuing to process crude oil from Libya, undermining the sanctions? 2. What evidence does the Commission have that Tamoil is no longer selling fuel obtained from Libyan oil? 3. Has money been passed since 2 March 2011 from Tamoil, Holborn, Oilinvest or any associated companies to NOC or other companies covered by the sanctions? 4. What information does the Commission have suggesting that sanctions are being indirectly undermined in this area? 5. What steps is the Commission taking to ensure that the sanctions are complied with in this area?
