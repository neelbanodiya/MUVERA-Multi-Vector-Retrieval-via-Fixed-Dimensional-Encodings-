Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (15 July 2011) The EU drugs strategy 2005-12 and the EU drugs action plan 2009-12 call upon Member States to improve the availability, accessibility, coverage and quality of interventions aimed at reducing drug demand, ranging from prevention, treatment, harm reduction and reintegration and rehabilitation. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is responsible for collecting information and for monitoring the drugs situation in the EU, including treatment. However, since organising drug treatment services falls within Member States' national competence and systems vary from one country to another, no comparable information on waiting lists is available at the EU level. The European Social Fund may be used for such services, in particular with a view to achieving social inclusion, provided that Member States define it as a priority for their country. Information on the use of the Fund for this purpose is not systematically collected at EU level.
