Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (19 April 2010) 1. Twenty-three Member States are participating in the School Fruit Scheme (SFS) in the school year 2009/2010. Only Finland, Sweden, Latvia and the United Kingdom did not wish to participate. Thirteen Member States started the distribution of fruit and vegetables in schools in 2009; others started in January, February and March 2010. For the school year 2010/2011, Latvia and the United Kingdom (Scotland) decided to join, in total 25 Member States will participate. 2. Member States are free to organise and execute the scheme the way they judge the most appropriate according to available budget, distribution channels, eating habits, number of schools and children, etc. However, Commission Regulation (EC) No 288/2009 of 7 April 2009 Commission Regulation (EC) No 288/2009 of 7 April 2009 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards Community aid for supplying fruit and vegetables, processed fruit and vegetables and banana products to children in educational establishments, in the framework of a School Fruit Scheme, OJ L 94, 8.4.2009. lays down the general framework for the application of the program. All schools are free to participate as long as the educational establishment is either administered or recognised by the competent authorities of a Member State and the application for the aid is valid. The aid applications shall be made in a manner specified by the competent authority of the Member State. Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 288/2009 provides the commitments to be fulfilled by the aid applicants. 3. The SFS is not just about supplying fruit and vegetables to children. Its objective is to change eating habits and established reflexes of young people and allow them to become familiar with healthy food. This is why ‘accompanying measures’, such as visits to farms, gardening in schools, games, educational activities, workshops, etc., are obligatory as central component of the SFS. Pursuant to Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 288/2009, Member States are required to describe in their strategy which accompanying measures they will adopt to ensure the successful implementation of their scheme. Those measures may focus on improving the target group's knowledge on the fruit and vegetable sector or healthy eating habits. 4. Administration, execution and control depend to a large extent on the strategies that Member States adopt, which must be in line with EU rules. Regulation (EC)
