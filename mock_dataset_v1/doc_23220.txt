WRITTEN QUESTION E-1050/06 by Michael Cashman (PSE) , Sophia in ’t Veld (ALDE) , Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) and Alexander Stubb (PPE‑DE) to the Council (17 March 2006) Subject: UN decision not to give LGBT NGOs consultative status On 25 January 2006, in the NGO Committee of the UN Ecosoc, the United States backed an Iranian motion to deny the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) and the Danish LGBT rights group Landsforeningen for Bøsser og Lesbiske (LBL) a fair hearing on their application and to deny UN consultative status to these organisations. Out of nearly 3000 groups enjoying this status, none are LGBT organisations. States opposed to the two groups' applications moved to have them summarily dismissed, an almost unprecedented move at the UN, where organisations are ordinarily allowed to state their cases. The US abstained on a vote which would have allowed the debate to continue and the groups to be heard. It then voted to reject the applications. The following voted against the applications to the NGO committee: the US, Cameroon, China, Cuba, Iran, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Senegal, Sudan and Zimbabwe. 1. How will the Council address this issue in its contacts with the 10 countries attempting to silence the voices of LGBT people in the UN? 2. Applications from three other LGBT organisations are pending before Ecosoc, inter alia ILGA-Europe. Will the Council act to secure support for these applications?
