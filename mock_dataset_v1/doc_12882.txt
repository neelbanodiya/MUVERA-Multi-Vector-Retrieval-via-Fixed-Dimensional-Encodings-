Question for written answer E-002716/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) (18 March 2011) Subject: Non-tariff barriers imposed by non-EU countries Many non-EU countries which are our economic and trading partners, some of which, such as Turkey, have established a customs union with the EU, require firms to submit with goods they are exporting certificates which are extremely time-consuming and costly to obtain. One example is the GB 18401 Industry Standard imposed by China: the relevant certificate of compliance is issued following specific tests which can be carried out only by laboratories officially accredited by the Chinese authorities. The situation is similar in the United States and in other countries which enjoy preferential trade relations with the EU. 1. Is the Commission aware of this situation? 2. Can it supply information about the tests or certificates which our trading partners impose as requirements in connection with EU exports? 3. Does it not see a need to standardise European customs arrangements with a view to stepping up checks on goods imported from third countries which may be regarded as harmful to consumers and which may serve to distort competition on our markets?
