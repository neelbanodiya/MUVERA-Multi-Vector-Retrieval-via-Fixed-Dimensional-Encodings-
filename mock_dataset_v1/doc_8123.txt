Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (5 November 2010) The Consumer Markets Scoreboard is designed to monitor how the single market is working for European consumers. It is an essential tool for monitoring the delivery the commitment made by the President of the Commission ‘to ensure that the benefits of the internal market get through to the final consumer’. The Scoreboard is based on top level indicators, such as ‘safety’. The fourth edition of the Scoreboard, published on 22 October 2010, includes various data on safety. Figures on the number of accidents recorded in a sample of hospitals are taken from the European Injury Database (IDB). Further indications about the safety of products come from the two EU‑wide rapid alert systems which track dangerous consumers' goods: RAPEX for non-food products and RASFF for food and feed products. The fourth edition of the Scoreboard has some similarities to the Danish Consumer Conditions Index and the Commission has worked closely with the Danish and other national authorities in its development. Member States are encouraged to use the national rankings provided in the Scoreboard in order to determine their own priorities. In addition, the third edition of the Scoreboard, published in March 2010, dedicated a chapter to enforcement in the Member States, presenting detailed information about economic and product safety enforcement activities.
