position on codifying information for purchasers, on best practice on mortgage credit, on the general good in insurance, and on a single market for payments; 15. Notes that different national regulations predominate in the area of retail financial services and that consumers are thus denied access to a wider range of choice and cheaper services; therefore welcomes the variety of proposals put forward by the Commission to equip the consumers with the instruments necessary to participate actively in the single financial market; 16. Commends the Commission on its decision to conduct an in-depth analysis of consumer protection rules in the financial services sector and emphasises that it is absolutely essential to strike a harmonious balance between the principles of market liberalisation and consumer protection if the system is to achieve the required degree of effectiveness; stresses that the common level of protection must be defined on the basis of the highest standards; 17. Reiterates its earlier position as stated in its resolution of 4 May 1999 that “open and secure retail markets” presuppose a high level of consumer protection, meaning appropriate instruments (information disclosure), the harmonisation of rules of conduct on the best practices that companies should apply (such as those related to adequate identification of clients and completion of contract transactions) and effective safeguards (dispute settlement and compensation schemes); is, therefore, not persuaded by the Commission's intention simply to develop a “Union-wide complaints network (including the use of an ombudsman for financial services)”; 18. Asks the Commission to submit a communication to Parliament on whether the existing regulatory apparatus for electronic commerce in the EU, if compared to the US legal framework, provides a fair and secure framework for companies and citizens, whether the question of liability is resolved by the present legislation and whether internet service providers offering a global service should be regulated by EU legislation or at global level; 19. Calls on the Commission to study the possibility of an EU directive on “consumer protection in the field of financial services”, based on the appropriate elements of existing EU legislation, e.g. by developing the directive on investment services (especially its Article 11 on the codes of conduct applicable to service provision), cross-border credit transfers (97/5/EC) OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 25 , the Commission recommendation on out-of-court settlements of consumer disputes (98/257/EC) OJ L 115, 17.4.1998, p. 31 and investor compensation schemes (97/9/EC) OJ L 84,
