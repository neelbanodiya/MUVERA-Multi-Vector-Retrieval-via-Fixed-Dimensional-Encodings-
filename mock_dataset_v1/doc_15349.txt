Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (23 March 2006) According to Article 60 of the EU-Croatia stabilisation and association agreement (SAA), Croatia shall authorise, by making full and expedient use of its existing procedures, the acquisition of real estate in Croatia by nationals of the Member States, except for areas and matters listed in Annex VII of the agreement. The existing Croatian procedures require EU citizens to apply for permission from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Justice when purchasing a property, with access subject to reciprocity. This leads to different treatment of nationals of different Member States, as different Member States treat Croatian nationals differently with respect to their access to real estate within the EU. The Commission is aware of recent discussions between the Italian and Croatian authorities on the question of reciprocity. The manner in which reciprocity is confirmed is a matter for the two States concerned on the basis of their respective legislation and practice. The Commission is currently looking into concerns raised by Italian nationals about possible incorrect application of Article 60 SAA by Croatia in this regard. In any case, the Commission continues to insist that Croatia streamlines its procedures for authorising the purchase of real estate by EU nationals so that these are applied in a full and expedient manner.
