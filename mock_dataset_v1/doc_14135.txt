how employees’ right to participate in the second pillar can be facilitated through enhanced social dialogue and to make proposals for promoting such a pillar where it does not yet exist; calls on them also to develop a method of governance to ensure that this fund is managed jointly, particularly with regard to its savings investment strategy; 43. Calls on the Member States to support the development of social and civic dialogue concerning old-age pension provision and to take full account of the results of this dialogue; 44. Considers that the EU rules concerning the third pillar and its smooth cross-border functioning must be examined in the light of the proper functioning of the internal market, particularly for financial products, and that a level playing field should be created; underlines that this re-examination of the rules must take account of the interests of members of these schemes; 45.
