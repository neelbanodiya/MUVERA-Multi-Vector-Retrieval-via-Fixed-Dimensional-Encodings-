16 December 2003 MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION further to the Council and Commission statements pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure by Francis Wurtz on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group on the conclusions of the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003 European Parliament resolution on the conclusions of the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003 The European Parliament , – having regard to the conclusions of the European Council of 12 and 13 December 2003, – having regard to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure, Economic and social affairs 1. Is alarmed at the economic slowdown in the EU, particularly in the euro zone, rising unemployment and widening inequalities, which to a large degree are the result of the economic and monetary policies pursued within the EU; 2. Takes note of the launch of the European Action for Growth, which is based on a programme of large-scale Community transport and communication projects; 3. Regrets that these projects are geared almost exclusively towards large-scale infrastructure with a view to enhancing trade in an enlarged Europe; call for them also to help bring about improvements in education, training and environmental protection; 4. Welcomes the fact that implementation of these projects is supposed to go hand in hand with the objective of investing 3% of gross domestic product in research by 2010; 5. Notes that the list of selected projects represents investment in the order of EUR 220 billion between now and 2020; fears, however, that it may not be possible to fund them, chiefly because of the constraints imposed on national budgets by the Stability Pact and the shortfall in the financial perspective at Community level; 6. Notes the EIB’s commitment to provide EUR 90 billion – including EUR 40 billion for transport – for this growth initiative by 2010; 7. Notes that it will be difficult to mobilise private capital for large-scale, long-term investments; fears, therefore, that profitability concerns will mean that the use of private funding will primarily benefit short-term investments; 8. Asks to be consulted before these projects get under way; calls on the Council to take account of its proposals; 9. Takes note of the Social Summit held in Brussels on 11 December, bringing together the leaders of European trade unions and employers’ organisations; believes, however, that the summit failed to come up with any specific solution to combat unemployment and
