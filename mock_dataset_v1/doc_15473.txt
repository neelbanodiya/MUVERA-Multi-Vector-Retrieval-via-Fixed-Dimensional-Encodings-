WRITTEN QUESTION E-0931/05 by Mathieu Grosch (PPE-DE) to the Commission (14 March 2005) Subject: Cabotage - Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 Cabotage may entail risks for businesses in certain Member States if it means indefinite periods of employment in another country than the one in which the company has its registered office. Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3118/93 OJ L 279, 12.11.1993, p. 1 . , as amended by Regulation (EC) 484/2002 OJ L 76, 19.3.2002, p. 1 . , states that carriers ‘shall be entitled ... to operate on a temporary basis national road haulage services for hire or reward in another Member State’. — How is the wording ‘on a temporary basis’ to be interpreted? Has more precise clarification been given? — Could the Commission not lay down or define this concept more precisely?
