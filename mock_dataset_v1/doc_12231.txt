WRITTEN QUESTION E-5424/09 by Morten Messerschmidt (EFD) to the Commission (4 November 2009) Subject: Stopping accession negotiations with Turkey in the light of Commission report The Commission’s most recent report on Turkey, the Turkey 2009 Progress Report, notes — in line with numerous earlier reports — that Turkey has not made any significant movement towards Europe, and that the country is generally in a state of both political and economic stagnation, while such things as the freedom of expression, equality and civil rights are still routinely trampled under foot. That being so, does not the Commission consider that accession negotiations between the EU and Turkey have degenerated into an unseemly farce which reflects badly on both parties, and that the Commission should instead embark on negotiations dealing with realistic topics, and with an EU‑Turkey relationship which is feasible given the major differences between them?
