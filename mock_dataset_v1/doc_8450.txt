to wear an adult safety belt (permanent exemption); - Member States may also grant an exemption here allowing more children than there are seats fitted with belts or seats without restraint systems to be transported over short distances and for occasional journeys (exemption valid for six years). Conclusions A general requirement has now in fact been introduced for both children and adults to be restrained if a safety belt is available and this now applies in the vast majority of vehicles in which persons are transported. This text is not perfect because: - it contains a number of exemptions based on practice in most Member States. The rapporteur considers the period of validity of the temporary exemptions (five and six years) to be reasonable; - certain provisions will need to be reviewed after the findings of studies, research and tests both in the European context, e.g. EURO-NCAP and EEVC, and at national level have become available. This means that at a future date certain details will need to be further adjusted and fine-tuned. The rapporteur is happy with the common position which builds on Parliament's first reading of the Commission proposal and better reflects the practical requirements and technical possibilities. This text strikes a realistic, acceptable balance between reality and the determination to achieve a situation with zero road fatalities, and the rapporteur recommends that Parliament approve it without amendment.
