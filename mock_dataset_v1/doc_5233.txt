the first call for proposals as part of the preparatory action in order to confirm the priority areas; believes greater attention should be paid to research into public acceptance of security research and to handling of classified data in order to allow more extensive exchange of such data between Member States; 11. Shares the view that the ESRP should focus concretely but not exclusively on research activities and technological areas with common added value so as to successfully anticipate, monitor and mitigate new security challenges, such as those related to bio-terrorism, cyber-crime and any other form of modern organised crime, to feasibly accomplish EU security missions and to minimise casualties; 12. Insists that the establishment of a security research programme must be combined with comprehensive analysis on a regular basis of security-related needs, in order to define the main technological and non-technological instruments required to address the post-cold war fluctuating security landscape; 13. Advocates, in parallel to technology-driven research, a focus on the development of common modelling and threat intelligence capabilities, utilising the comparative advantages enjoyed by Member States in every given instance; 14. Points out that in some cases proposed projects will contain dual elements of security and safety, which should therefore be strongly interlinked; underlines that to require research under the ESRP to deal solely with security aspects would be counter-productive; proposes, therefore, a more integrated approach and close coordination between the ESRP and other research activities within the Seventh EU Research Framework Programme; recommends that the ESRP should make as clear as possible the distinction between military and non-military research; 15. Considers that in the Commission's Communication there is an accent on technology research; calls for a more balanced interaction between research in the natural sciences and technology and other sciences, in particular political, social and human sciences; 16. Considers that, in order to bridge the gap between research and real-life applications and to put technological advances into service in real everyday use, special and greater attention should be paid to operations research (OR), systems analysis (SA) and simulation; 17. Points out that, in order to tackle the substantial weaknesses and failures of the Member States in the fields of C4ISR systems (command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), greater progress in sensors systems, biotechnology, space and IT technology should be sought; 18. Notes that aerospace-related applications and services in fields such as global positioning, worldwide
