Reply (22 December 2008) The Council is aware of the recent problems with regard to Belarusian children travelling on aid trips and holidays to various European countries, including Ireland. The countries concerned are currently holding consultations with the relevant Belarusian authorities to address bilaterally the concerns that have arisen in this context, and therefore the Council does not at this stage envisage intervening in this issue.
