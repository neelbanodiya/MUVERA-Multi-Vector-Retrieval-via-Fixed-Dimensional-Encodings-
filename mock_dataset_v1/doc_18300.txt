Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (10 August 2010) The Commission — in line with G20 commitments — put forward the proposal for the now adopted Regulation on Credit Rating Agencies (CRA) Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies, OJ 17.11.2009. which will be fully applicable from 7 December 2010. The regulation aims at responding to the problems identified with regard to the activity of the credit rating agencies. It introduces mandatory registration for all credit rating agencies operating in the EU and puts in place a number of rigorous requirements to make sure that: (i) the risks of conflicts of interest affecting ratings are effectively addressed; (ii) credit rating agencies remain vigilant regarding the quality of the rating methodology and the ratings; and (iii) credit rating agencies act in a transparent manner. It also establishes a mandatory oversight regime by competent authorities in the Member States with active involvement of the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR). On 2 June 2010, the Commission put forward a proposal to revise Regulation 1060/2009 on Credit Rating Agencies, which entrusts the future European Security Markets Authority (ESMA) with exclusive supervisory competences over CRAs and requires issuers of structured products to release the same level information to all interested CRAs. This means a clear improvement of the existing framework since it provides better protection of CRA users-through centralised supervision at EU level and by enhancing competition and transparency in the CRA business. In its communication dated 2nd of June, ‘Regulating financial services for sustainable growth’ , the Commission announced that it is currently assessing a number of additional issues relating to CRAs, including in connection with the structure of the CRA market and the reliance on credit ratings, and that it will present its conclusions on all these issues in September. If necessary, further legislative measures could be envisaged in 2011.
