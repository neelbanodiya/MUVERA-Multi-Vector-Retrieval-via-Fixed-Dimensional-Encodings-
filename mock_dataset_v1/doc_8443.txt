ORAL QUESTION H-0067/02 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Camilo Nogueira Román to the Commission Subject: The brutal Israeli destruction of airports and ports in Gaza built with the aid of EU investment In a brutal terrorist attack, the Israeli state has just destroyed Palestinian airports and ports in Gaza which were built with EU funding. It is incumbent on the EU not only to condemn this brutal act, and the disrespect for the EU itself which it implies, at political level, but also to call on Israel to make good the investment undone by the destructive actions of its army. What action does the Commission intend to take in this connection?
