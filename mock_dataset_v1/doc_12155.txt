of movement and residence is a fundamental right within the EU, MEPs stress that, with greater intra-Community mobility in general, the number of Community citizens who die in a country other than their country of origin is bound to increase. The draft resolution concludes that the repatriation of mortal remains without excessive cost or bureaucracy should be regarded " as a corollary of the right of each EU citizen to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States ". MEPs in the committee also add that the provisions of the Council of Europe's 1973 Strasbourg Agreement, which impose strict rules on the cross-border transfer of mortal remains, were the source of indirect discrimination in that they applied essentially to " non-nationals ", which ran counter to the Community scheme of things. The Commission is urged to ascertain whether or not the Agreement is compatible with Community law and to ensure that the latter is upheld. MEPs in the committee also call for harmonised standards and procedures to be applied in the cross-border transportation of corpses throughout the EU and ask the Commission to ensure that, as far as possible, Community citizens are treated in the same way as nationals in their home country.
