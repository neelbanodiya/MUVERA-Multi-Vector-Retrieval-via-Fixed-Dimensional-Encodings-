WRITTEN QUESTION E-1446/09 by Hélène Goudin (IND/DEM) to the Commission (5 March 2009) Subject: Plucking of down from live geese The Swedish television programme Kalla Fakta has broadcast a couple of high profile reports on the plucking of down from live geese. The programme showed that a large number of farms and companies in Hungary and Poland pluck the down from live geese. The television report showed that this painful down production happens with the direct support of the EU, since a number of the farms in question receive EU subsidies. Can the Commission confirm that EU funding has gone to farms, producers and companies which pluck down from live geese? What is the total amount of EU funding that the down producers have received from the EU budget during the last five years (2004‑08)?
