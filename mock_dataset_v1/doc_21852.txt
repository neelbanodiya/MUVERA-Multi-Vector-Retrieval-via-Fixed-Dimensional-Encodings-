Question for written answer E-4710/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (25 June 2010) Subject: Use of EAFRD funds for restoration work in Serra do Courel (Galicia, Spain) In its answer to Question No E‑1841/10 on the effects of restoration work in Serra do Courel, the Commission states that ‘following information provided by the competent authorities of Galicia, no European funds has been allocated for these hydrological-forestry restoration measures that were financed exclusively by national funds’. However, there is a sign in Serra do Courel displaying the seal of the Xunta (autonomous government) of Galicia, mentioning the Directorate-General for Mountains and Forestry of the Galician Ministry of the Environment, alongside the EU flag and the words ‘European Union, EAFRD’. The sign states the following: ‘Procedure No: 1127183/2007. Beneficiary: C.M.V.M.C. “Sudros e Miranda”, Vecinos de Eiriz. Folgoso do Caurel (Lugo). Approved budget: EUR 40 361.26 plus VAT Work to be carried out: Planting of maritime pine trees across 25 hectares and construction of a forest road 1 km in length Deadline for tree planting: 14 August 2008 Maintenance grant payable until 2013 Project co‑financed by the European Union’. In view of the above, could the Commission state whether this work to regenerate water and woodland resources has been financed through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, as the sign states? What information has the Commission received from the Spanish authorities concerning compliance with Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. , in particular with regard to damage to natural habitats and the introduction of non-native species?
