WRITTEN QUESTION E-1910/08 by Carlos Carnero González (PSE) to the Commission (9 April 2008) Subject: General road plan for the Madrid autonomous region The government of the Madrid region (Comunidad de Madrid) recently adopted a general road plan for the region, which the author of this question believes should, since it seriously affects areas that are protected under EC law, be subject to a mandatory impact assessment as laid down in law in respect of those areas. The Madrid regional government is well-known for its repeated failures to comply with the EU nature protection legislation. The most recent example was the M‑501 motorway, which has been the subject of infringement proceedings taken out by the Commission and a ruling by the Higher Court of Justice of the Madrid region. What measures is the Commission taking to require the Madrid regional government to apply the EU nature protection legislation to the general road plan, with a view to carrying out an impact assessment and ensuring the preservation in full of the areas affected by the plan?
