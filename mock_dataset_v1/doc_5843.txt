implementation of legal unbundling for distribution system operators until 1 July 2007. In addition the Member States can apply for overall exemption if they have alternative instruments which have the same aim as legal unbundling, have already been implemented and have been shown to be effective overall. Under Article 29 the Commission must adopt an opinion on a Member State’s application for exemption from the provisions of the directive (including the provisions on legal unbundling of distribution system operators). If appropriate it can then ‘submit proposals to Parliament and to the Council to amend the relevant provisions of the directive or provide for other appropriate means’. Once more on the grounds of willingness to compromise, your rapporteur is not against this option. It must however be made clear that exemption applies only to legal unbundling of distribution system operators and that notification to the Commission is not sufficient. In this instance therefore the proposed directive must be amended! If it is to be consistent with the outcome of the first reading, Parliament can agree only under this condition. What does ‘other appropriate means’ mean? Parliament has the legislative power under Article 251 of the EC Treaty to amend a directive. There are no other ‘appropriate means’ for a decision by Parliament. This part should therefore be deleted for the sake of clarity.
