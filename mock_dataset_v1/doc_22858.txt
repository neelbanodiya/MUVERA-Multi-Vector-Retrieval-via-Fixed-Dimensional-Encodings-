Answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission (5 December 2011) Improving literacy levels is crucial if Europe is to meet its Europe 2020 ambitions for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and if Europe's citizens are to develop the key competences necessary for lifelong learning. Currently, 20 % of 15-year-olds across Europe cannot read at an adequate level. Within the framework of the Education and Training 2020 programme, EU Member States have set out to reduce the share of low performers in reading to less than 15 % by 2020. On 1 February 2011, the Commission launched a High-Level Group of experts in the field of literacy. This group is examining effective ways of supporting literacy throughout lifelong learning, and will make proposals to the Commission in 2012 on improving literacy among both school students and adults. The work of the High-Level Group also supports my Europe-wide literacy campaign —‘Europe loves reading’ — which aims to raise awareness of the changing and complex nature of literacy. In 2008 about 796 million adults, 17 % of the world's population, were illiterate, two thirds of which were women. Improving literacy levels is crucial for countries to enable citizens to develop the key competences necessary for better livelihood opportunities, broad social and economic development and lifelong learning. The EU supports developing countries within the framework of the recent Communication on ‘Increasing the impact of EU Development Policy: an Agenda for Change’ Available at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2011:0637:FIN:EN:PDF . The EU works with governments and non-state actors to expand access to quality primary and secondary schooling and, where appropriate, supporting alternative and second chance opportunities to promote better learning achievement, especially in literacy and other essential skills.
