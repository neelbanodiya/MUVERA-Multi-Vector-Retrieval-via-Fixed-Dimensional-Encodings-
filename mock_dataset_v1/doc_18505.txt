Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (3 December 2010) The Commission is well aware of the risks posed by asbestos fibres. With a view to increasing worker protection, Directive 2009/148/EC Directive 2009/148/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2009 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to asbestos at work, OJ L 330, 16.12.2009. consolidates various asbestos-related legislative instruments to make the legislation easier to understand and implement. In particular, Article 14 of that directive makes it an obligation for employers to provide appropriate training for all workers who are, or are likely to be, exposed to dust from asbestos or materials containing asbestos. Implementing that legislation is the responsibility of Member States. As regards any further steps needed to protect persons, and in particular workers, who have been in contact with and affected by asbestos, the Commission would refer the Honourable Member to the answers to recent parliamentary questions. These include the joint answer to Questions E‑8199/10 , E‑8205/10 , E‑8210/10 , E‑8304/10 , E‑8309/10 and E‑8313/10 concerning guidelines, and the joint answer to questions E‑8197/10 , E‑8203/10 , E‑8208/10 , E‑8302/10 , E‑8307/10 and E‑8311/10 , which refer specifically to continuing contacts with professional organisations in the field. The Commission has no plans at present to take any measures to finance the remediation of sites where asbestos has been extracted or processed or any measures targeting families of persons who have died as a result of exposure to asbestos.
