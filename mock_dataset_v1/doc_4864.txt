Answer given by Mr Cioloş on behalf of the Commission (22 November 2011) On the basis of the proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework of 29 June 2011 COM(2011) 500 final. , the Commission presented on 12 October 2011 a set of proposals laying down the legislative framework for the common agricultural policy (CAP) in the period 2014-2020. In the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the proposals aim at enhancing the effectiveness of the CAP in furthering the objectives of viable food production, sustainable management of natural resources and climate action and balanced territorial development. To this end, better targeted support is a key element. Hence the new design of better targeted direct payments includes, among others, a basic payment, support for practices beneficial to the environment and climate and support to young farmers. In addition, it is thus proposed that direct payments will be better targeted by limiting support to active farmers that pursue agricultural activities (thus excluding those companies where direct payments do not exceed 5 % of total receipts from non-agricultural activities), as well as to reduce and ultimately cap payments to large beneficiaries. In the area of rural development, it is proposed to reinforce the strategic approach in the pursuit of Europe 2020, including a Common Strategic Framework with other EU funds, quantified targets set in programmes in relation to the rural development priorities, as well as higher support and co-financing rates for certain areas, beneficiaries and measures. Given the strong links between agriculture, food processing and other economic activities producing growth and jobs in rural areas, it is envisaged that the policy will continue to support investments in processing and marketing of agricultural products, with higher support rates in less developed regions and for innovative projects.
