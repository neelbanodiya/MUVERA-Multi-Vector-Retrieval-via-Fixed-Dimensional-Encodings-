WRITTEN QUESTION E-2612/07 by Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 May 2007) Subject: Implementation by the Netherlands of Directive 2003/86/EC on the right to family reunification 1. A condition for entitlement to family unification in the Netherlands is an income amounting to 120 % of the minimum earnings of a 23‑year old (see Article 3.22(2)(a), together with Article 3.74 of the Immigration Decree). In the Commission's opinion, is this requirement in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Directive 2003/86/EC OJ L 251, 3.10.2003, p. 12. (‘without recourse to the social assistance system’) and the principle of proportionality? 2. For the purposes of family unification and reunification, the Dutch authorities require a naturalisation test to be completed abroad (see Article 16(1)(h) of the Immigration Law). Does the Commission consider this requirement to be in accordance with Article 7(2) of Directive 2003/86/EC which merely refers to ‘integration measures’, and the general principles of Community law, including the principle of proportionality in particular? 3. Under Article 3.71(1), together with Article 3.71(a)(2)(c) of the Immigration Decree, family members unable to prove that they have passed the naturalisation test are not eligible for temporary residence permits unless there are medical reasons. Does the Commission consider this to be in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Directive 2003/86/EC and the Community principle of effective legal protection? 4. Article 29(1)(e) and (f) of the Immigration Law stipulate that, to be eligible for family reunification, the person enjoying the right of asylum and his/her spouse must have the same nationality. Does the Commission consider this requirement to be in accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2003/86/EC? 5. Has the Commission made its views known to the Dutch authorities? 6. If so, can it forward to me a copy of its letter to the Dutch authorities? 7. Is the Commission prepared to initiate infringement proceedings against the Netherlands if its legislation remains entirely or partly unamended despite non-compliance with EC law?
