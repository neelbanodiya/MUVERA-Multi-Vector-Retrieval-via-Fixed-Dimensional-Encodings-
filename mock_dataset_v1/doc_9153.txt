Urges the Commission to ensure better visibility for Union-funded activities overseas; Disclosure statement by beneficiary countries 49. Recalls once more its view that development aid in general and budget support in particular should be tied to an ex-ante disclosure statement, issued by the recipient country's government and signed by its finance minister, concerning selected issues that affect the governance and accountability structure of a beneficiary country; Human resources 50. Is extremely concerned that vacancy rates in third-country Delegations are considered as a ’critical risk’ Point 40, Court of Auditors’ Annual Report 2009 on the EDFs. and that resource constraints, staff shortages and high staff turnover significantly hamper the Commission's effective implementation of EDF funds, in particular as regards project management, training, monitoring, and reliable and timely audits; consequently expects the European External Action Service to make it a priority to equip all Delegations with adequate levels of qualified staff, notably experts in the field of development; EuropeAid 51. Regrets that, although the ex-ante controls by authorising officers in EuropeAid's central services were assessed by the Court of Auditors as effective, it concluded that EuropeAid's supervisory and control systems were only partially effective in ensuring that payments are regular; 52. Reminds the Commission that: - EuropeAid should, in the context of its planned review of its overall control strategy, develop a key indicator of the estimated financial impact of the uncorrected errors after all controls have been implemented; - EuropeAid should, in the context of this review, assess the cost-effectiveness of the various controls, notably of the transactional ex-post control system, and examine the relevance and feasibility of an annual audit of a representative statistical sample of closed projects; – regarding budget support, EuropeAid should ensure that the specific conditions for payments are clearly defined and that Delegations’ reports provide a structured and formalised demonstration of progress achieved in public
