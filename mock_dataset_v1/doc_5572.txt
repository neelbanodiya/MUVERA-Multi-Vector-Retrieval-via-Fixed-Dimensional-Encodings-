WRITTEN QUESTION E-2659/06 by Mario Borghezio (NI) to the Council (16 June 2006) Subject: Appointment of a former terrorist as assistant to the Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies Sergio D’Elia, a former terrorist, has been elected to the important post of assistant to the Speaker of the Italian Chamber of Deputies. Among other things, he was once involved in the murder of an Italian policeman and used to belong to the terrorist organisation ‘Prima Linea’. Does not the Council consider that this decision, which is meeting with strong opposition from trade unions representing the police, is in conflict with the anti-terrorism principles upheld by the European Union?
