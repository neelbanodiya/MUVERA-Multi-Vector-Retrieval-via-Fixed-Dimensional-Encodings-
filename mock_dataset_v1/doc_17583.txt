its motion for a resolution: 1. Notes that there is a tension in the budgetary procedure for 2006 between high aspirations (a new college of Commissioners, the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy) and the fact that this will be the last year of the 2000 - 2006 Financial Perspective and the final year of many multi-annual programmes, such as the European Social Fund, the labour incentive measures programme, the anti-discrimination programme, and the social inclusion action programme; 2.

Expects that the Commission will work closely with the European Parliament in the design of the European Year of Workers´ Mobility; 6. Expects that the amounts set aside for the European Year of Workers' Mobility will be spent on decentralised campaigns close to the citizens and that the visibility and the services of existing tools, such as EURES and EUROPASS, will be extended, and their coverage increased to include migrants from third countries, since, given the ageing population, more sustained immigration flows will increasingly be required to meet the needs of the EU labour market; 7.
