the measures contained in the legislative proposal 'Improving America's Security Act' of 2007, when adopted by the US Congress, will have a direct impact on EU countries, in particular concerning police and judicial cooperation in the fight against terrorism and the protection of fundamental rights and guarantees; 12. Welcomes the commitment shown by Vice-President F. Frattini to launching a Euro-Atlantic cooperation framework in the fight against international terrorism, with harmonised rules on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms; requests the Commission to continue those efforts and to fully involve Parliament in that initiative; 13. Notes the newly created High-Level Working Group composed of representatives of the Commission, the Council and US governmental representatives of the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, which constitutes the framework for EU-US dialogue on security matters; so as to give greater democratic legitimacy to this dialogue, calls for the European Parliament to be involved; 14. Recalls the resolutions of Parliament calling for the closure of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre; calls on the Council and the Commission to urge the US Government to find a mechanism that will facilitate the charging or releasing of detainees in accordance with international law; is concerned that the very existence of the Guantánamo Bay detention centre continues to send out a negative signal as to how the fight against terrorism is being pursued; urges the Council to issue a clear and forceful declaration calling on the US Government to put an end to the practice of extraordinary arrests and renditions and that the US Government be requested for clarifications regarding the existence of secret prisons outside US territory; 15. Reiterates the view that NATO, which remains an important tie between many European countries and the US and a guarantor of European security, should develop its potential as a transatlantic forum for political debate in a true partnership of equals; 16. Welcomes the close cooperation between the US and the EU on the status negotiations in Kosovo and highlights the need to find a balanced and viable outcome on Kosovo's future status; encourages both partners to use the EU-US Summit, to be held on 30 April 2007 in Washington, to endorse their consensus on the Ahtisaari Plan and to continue their dialogue with all parties concerned; recommends, to this end, a closer security relationship between NATO and the EU, in particular in view of the situation in Kosovo,
