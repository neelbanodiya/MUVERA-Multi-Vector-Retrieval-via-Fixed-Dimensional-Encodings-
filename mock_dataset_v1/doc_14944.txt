, which stated that ‘macroeconomic surveillance covers countries with current account deficits and surpluses with appropriate differentiation as regards the urgency of policy responses and the type of corrective actions required’; points out that this declaration paved the way for a final agreement on the ‘six pack’; invites the Commission to remain fully committed to it; maintains that any conclusions that may be reached by the Council cannot limit the Commission's legal rights in this respect; 6. Notes that most indicative thresholds for the indicators used in the draft scoreboard are either upper or lower thresholds, even though the regulation explicitly states that both upper and lower thresholds shall be adopted unless this is inappropriate; stresses, in that connection, that the Commission working document does not contain an explanation of the inappropriateness of setting both upper and lower thresholds for most of these indicators; 7.
