The appropriations for this title of the budget remain stable overall compared to 2005, at a total level of EUR 548 million. Following the development of this sector, including ongoing and recently finalised legislative proposals, there are however considerable changes for some lines proposed in the PDB. The rapporteur will need to analyse these appropriations carefully. For the time being, the following substantial variations can for example be observed: Budget line 2005 Budget 2006 PDB Difference % 18 02 0 - Schengen facility 336.000.000 310.000.000 - 26.000.000 - 7.7% 18 08 01 - Prince - Area of freedom, security and justice 5.000.000 3.200.000 - 1.800.000 - 36.0% 18 08 02 - Schengen information system (SIS II) 15.800.000 1.050.000 - 14.750.000 - 93.3% 18 08 03 - Visa information system (VIS) 3.300.000 29.000.000 18.000.000 + 545% Agencies 49. The rapporteur draws attention to the fact that, overall, appropriations proposed for the agencies are considerably increased in the PDB (+ EUR 46 million in heading 3). In Annex 3 members will find a summary provided by the Commission for all agencies. The rapporteur will evaluate the situation after the annual meeting with agencies on 16 June. An evaluation of the budgetary impact of Executive Agencies will also need to be undertaken along the course of the budgetary procedure.
