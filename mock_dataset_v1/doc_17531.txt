limited considering that the Lisbon strategy priority is not receiving a clear boost in the PDB 2006. Concerning staff 12. Agencies participate in Community policies and carry out tasks of public authority under the responsibility of the Commission but on a decentralised basis, as defined by articles 53, 54 par.2, lit a) and 185 of the Financial Regulation. To do so, each agency has its own structure located in one of the Member States. The rapporteurs repeat what was said in earlier occasions, that contrary to the case of the Commission itself, agencies' staff (title 1) and buildings (title 2) are financed under heading 3 (or 4) of the Financial Perspective although they are purely administrative expenditure. 13. Comparing the establishment plans for 2004 and 2005, rapporteurs notice an increase of 487 posts, i.e. an increase of 21% figures provided by Budgetary Support Service, Annex I, Table 3 .

The rapporteurs insist that the de-centralized European agencies are European organisations and the nationality of staff should respect a geographical balance. In order to achieve an appropriate mix of geographical, gender, statuary and age amongst the agencies personnel, rapporteurs are calling on the agencies and the Commission to develop a proper career policy and to create a career profile for the agencies on the basis of an
