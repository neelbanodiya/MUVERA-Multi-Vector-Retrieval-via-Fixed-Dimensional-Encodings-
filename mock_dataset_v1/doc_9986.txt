Reply (8 September 2010) The Council shares the Honourable Member's concern about unfair competition from companies in third countries. Problems arising from unfair trade are dealt with in the framework of the Common Commercial Policy, which is governed by Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It is based on uniform principles, particularly with regard to measures to protect European industries against unfair competition from third countries. The general framework for addressing problems of unfair trade consists of the following Trade Defence Instruments, in particular: — Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Union (the ‘Basic anti-dumping Regulation’) OJ L 343, 22.12.2009, p. 51. ; — Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Union OJ L 188, 18.7.2009, p. 93. ; — Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 laying down Community procedures in the field of common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the World Trade organisation (also called ‘Trade Barrier Regulation’) OJ L 349, 31.12.1994, p. 71. . As to the issue of whether there is any coordinated action at European level to combat the phenomenon of unfair competition from Chinese firms, the Council points out that during the 24th EU‑China Joint Committee on 20 and 21 May 2010 the EU encouraged China to accelerate the accession negotiations to join the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). China submitted its revised GPA accession offer on 9 July 2010. As far as the importance of enhancing bilateral investment flows is concerned both parties pledged to intensify discussions to further improve investment conditions on both sides. It was agreed for experts to hold further exploratory exchanges at technical level in the months ahead with a view to reporting back to the Summit. Both sides expressed hope that the publication of the State Council Circular ‘Opinions on Further Improving the Use of Foreign Capital’ will contribute to fostering an investment climate that is conducive to foreign investment Report of the 24th EU‑China Joint Committee — 21 May 2010 (m.d.: 299/10, points 4, 14. and 15. . At the WTO level on the occasion of the third Trade Policy Review of China in the WTO which took place on 31 May and
