WRITTEN QUESTION E-3825/05 by Werner Langen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 October 2005) Subject: Cheap fuel for people living in border areas The German petroleum industry plans to reduce ‘fuel tourism’ in Germany by offering discount cards in areas bordering France and Luxembourg. This move is aimed at ensuring petroleum revenue in border areas unable to withstand competition from France and Luxembourg. High taxes in Germany mean that prices can differ by seven cents or more per litre of petrol and by four cents per litre of diesel. The extra pollution caused by fuel tourism and the related additional journeys transporting large amounts of fuel in spare cans, increasing the risk of accident, are also cause for concern. 1. Is the introduction of discount cards for German consumers living in areas bordering France and Luxembourg compatible with European competition law? 2. Is it permitted, as the German petroleum industry wishes, for the scheme to be funded through a separate foundation under public law? 3. Have there been similar instances of discounts being offered to people living in border regions in the EU, possibly also in other industries?
