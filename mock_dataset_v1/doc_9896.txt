Question for written answer E-3730/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (27 May 2010) Subject: Sale of land in African countries Many African countries, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Sudan and Madagascar are currently the subject of new commercial interest, no longer for their raw materials but for their very land, which is being sold by local governments at cheap prices to richer countries such as China, South Korea, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which are making them into their own ‘granaries’, so to speak. International organisations such as the UN and FAO have expressed very cautious views on this phenomenon, given that any positive impact on the economies of the poorer countries — which would be highly desirable — could be far smaller than expected and could be accompanied by controversial forms of exploitation of the territory and of the local workforce. Does the Commission believe that this phenomenon could be regarded as a clear opportunity for poor countries, or does it rather consider that it might conceal a dangerous, surreptitious form of neo-colonialism, promising apparent opportunities but essentially incapable of sparking a real, virtuous economic development process which respects the territory, history and rights of the local people? Is the Commission aware of any evident signs, or indications based on circumstantial evidence, that any EU Member States might be involved in this particular phenomenon, perhaps not only in respect of Africa? If so, which European operators are involved (public or private individuals/bodies, Member States, companies, banks, investment funds, etc.) and in respect of which poor countries (including outside Africa) and to what extent have they hitherto operated along such lines?
