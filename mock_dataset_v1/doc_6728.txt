Question for written answer E-005886/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mara Bizzotto (EFD) (16 June 2011) Subject: Establishment of an al-Qaeda controlled State in the Western Sahara Since the mid‑Seventies, the Polisario Front, a political movement, has claimed sovereignty of the Western Sahara against the competing claims of Morocco. Until recently, Polisario’s objectives were purely secular, and were unrelated to the Islamic jihad promoted by movements such as al-Qaeda. Between 2010 and 2011, however, Algerian security forces and institutions for the study of terrorism have warned that a growing number of Polisario Front members have begun to establish links with the jihadist group known as ‘Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb’ (AQIM). A Polisario-supporting imam was arrested after the security forces found letters addressed to AQIM, as well as weapons and explosives, at his home. Various other members of Polisario have issued official statements in support of AQIM and the jihadist cause, indicating their own readiness to transform the Western Sahara into an operating base for AQIM. Given the Western Sahara’s geographical proximity to the EU, does the Commission regard the possibility of that region falling under AQIM’s direct control as a serious threat to the security of the EU and the whole Mediterranean area? Does the Commission intend to make every effort to find a solution to the dispute between Morocco and the Polisario Front over the sovereignty of the Western Sahara as quickly as possible, to reduce the risk of AQIM taking advantage of the lack of State authority to entrench its own presence there?
