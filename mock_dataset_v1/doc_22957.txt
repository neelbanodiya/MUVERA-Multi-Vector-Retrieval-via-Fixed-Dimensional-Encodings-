Answer given by Baroness Ashton on behalf of the Commission (7 December 2009) The Commission discusses human rights-related issues in all its contacts with representatives of the Iranian government, at all levels. It will continue to call on the Iranian authorities to respect Human Rights and fundamental freedoms in the country, including pursuant to international agreements and conventions Iran voluntarily signed and ratified. The Commission has supported several statements issued by the EU Council Presidencies expressing EU’s concern at the way Iranian authorities handled the street demonstrations that took place following the 12 June 2009 presidential elections. On 4 November 2009 the Commission summoned the Iranian Ambassador to the EU to complain about the sentencing to four years in jail against the employee of the United Kingdom embassy, Mr Hossein Rassam. On that occasion the Commission also asked Iran to free all political detainees arrested after the June elections and to ensure better protection to Human Rights in the country.
