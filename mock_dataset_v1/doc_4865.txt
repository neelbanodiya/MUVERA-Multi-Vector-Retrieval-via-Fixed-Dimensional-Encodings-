1999/C 348 E/197 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0922/99 by Riccardo Nencini (PSE) to the Commission (8 April 1999) Subject: Laboratoires Boironm - the case of Mr Mariano Parrucci Mr Mariano Parrucci, resident in Italy and registered on the provincial list of disabled persons available for suitable employment, was sent by the Bologna employment office to the company Laboratoires Boironm to fill a vacant position. In October 1998 the above-mentioned company rejected Mr Parrucci, claiming it was awaiting instructions - which never arrived - from its head office. This is a clear breach of the law in general and of existing legislation in Italy. Will the Commission take urgent action to protect one of the rights of a disabled person, a right that is enshrined in the law of an EU Member State?
