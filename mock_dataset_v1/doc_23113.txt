the different EU instruments with a view to their optimisation in the area of security and development, P. whereas, apart from the designation of six pilot countries (Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Sierra Leone, East Timor and Yemen), the discussions launched between the Commission, the Council, the European Parliament and civil society as part of the follow-up to the above Commission communication on the EU response to situations of fragility have not yet made it possible to implement specific measures on the ground, Q. whereas European undertakings are present and have interests in conflict zones, 1.
