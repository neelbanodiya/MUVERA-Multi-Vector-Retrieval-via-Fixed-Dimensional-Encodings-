Question for written answer E-000803/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Jim Higgins (PPE) (31 January 2012) Subject: Economic activity in aquaculture in Europe Can the Commission state what new initiatives it intends to pursue this year so as to promote greater economic activity in the field of aquaculture in Europe? Does it agree that more marketing needs to take place? Does it agree that the lack of information given to consumers means that in large stores only five or six species are sold, whereas there are 200 species commercially available?
