WRITTEN QUESTION E-6315/09 by Roberta Angelilli (PPE) to the Commission (16 December 2009) Subject: Possible programmes or funding to support the full educational and social integration of schoolchildren with disabilities in the province of Pistoia In recent years the province of Pistoia and its municipalities have noted an increase in social unease due to the difficulty in providing assistance to disabled pupils of all school levels. Despite the fact that Laws 517/77 and 104/92 facilitate the right to education through the introduction of support teachers and other forms of support for school integration, it is still impossible fully to meet the needs of students with disabilities, owing to a lack of sufficient funds. In fact, all forms of support for the full educational and social integration of students with disabilities involve high costs which are difficult for the municipalities and province of Pistoia to bear. The aim of both the municipalities and the province is to be able to provide full access to the right to education for this new school year and for subsequent years. This is a constitutional right with two aims: to allow these children's personality to develop and to encourage full integration at the same level as other, able-bodied, pupils. In the light of the above, can the Commission say: 1. whether any programmes or funding are available to support students with disabilities; 2. whether any Community funding is available to help municipalities and provinces bear the high costs of assistance to pupils with disabilities?
