Question for written answer E-005760/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (14 June 2011) Subject: EU zoos fail to comply with law Further to the ‘EU Zoo Inquiry 2011’, it has emerged that EU Member States have a tendency to fail to comply with the EU‑wide management and safety standards for zoos laid down by Directive 22/1999. The regulation of zoos and the protection of wild animals in captivity is the responsibility of each individual Member State and zoos are supposed to perform their important role in an appropriate manner with a view to species conservation. Can the Commission therefore say what measures it intends to take to protect wild animals and safeguard biodiversity by calling on the Member States to comply with existing EU legislation, thereby enhancing the role of zoos in terms of biodiversity protection and animal welfare?
