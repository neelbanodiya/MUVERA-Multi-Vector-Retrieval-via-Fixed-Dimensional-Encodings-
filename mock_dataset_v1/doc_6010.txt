Question for Question Time H-000071/2011 to the Commission Part-session: March 2011 Rule 116 Georgios Toussas (GUE/NGL) Subject: Problems of immigrants and refugees in Greece Hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees in Greece live in squalid conditions, without a residence or work permit or international protection. Most of the political refugees and immigrants are bound, ultimately, for other EU countries, where relatives or friends are already established, but cannot travel there because they are not issued with identity cards or travel documents because of the Dublin Regulation. The recent tragic sinking of a boat off the coast of Corfu, in which immigrants, including women and children, died, shed light on the explosive situation in Greece. When will the Commission abrogate the Dublin Regulation so as to allow immigrants trapped in Greece to travel to their countries of destination? What is its position on the need to give immigrants identity cards and to grant international protection to political refugees?
