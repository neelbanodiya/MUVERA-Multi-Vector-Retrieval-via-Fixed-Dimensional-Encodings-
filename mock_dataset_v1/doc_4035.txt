commitment to conclude negotiations on competition and government procurement only when adequate capacity has been built; 34. Calls on the Commission to respond unconditionally and in a flexible way to demands by ACP countries to review contentious issues in the IEPAs, including the definition of ‘substantially all trade’; the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) clause, obligations concerning the elimination of export taxes, the standstill clause and bilateral and special safeguards; 35. Calls for the Commission, in the event that Central African states which are not among the LDCs do not wish to sign an EPA, to examine all alternative possibilities in order to provide those countries with a new framework for trade which is in conformity with WTO rules; 36. Points out that the WTO rules do not require agreement on services or the Singapore Issues; stresses, therefore, that the Commission must not demand negotiations on those issues if these countries are unwilling to negotiate on them, and that it cannot use the ‘rendezvous clauses’ in the IEPA to force all the countries in the region to discuss those issues; 37. Calls on the Commission not to include provisions on intellectual property in the EPAs, which would hinder access to essential medicines; calls on the European Union to use the EPA framework to help ACP countries apply the flexibilities provided for in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health; 38. Stresses that the EPAs should include enhanced chapters on development for the achievement of the MDGs and for the promotion and strengthening of basic social and human rights; 39. Stresses that any comprehensive EPA must also include provisions regarding good governance, transparency in political offices, and human rights; 40. Stresses that Parliament should be kept informed on a regular basis and actively participate in the EPA negotiating process; points, in this context, to Parliament’s role of scrutiny and early warning, as well as the willingness of Members to trigger a more in-depth dialogue between the European institutions and representatives of the ACP states and civil society; 41. Calls for appropriate and transparent monitoring mechanisms - with a clear role and influence - to follow the impact of EPAs, with increased ACP ownership and broad stakeholder consultation; 42. Stresses in particular the crucial role of ACP parliaments and non‑state actors in the monitoring and management of EPAs, and asks the Commission to guarantee their involvement in the ongoing negotiation procedures; takes
