WRITTEN QUESTION E-3819/09 by Daniel Hannan (ECR) to the Commission (29 July 2009) Subject: Import duty on bamboo A constituent of mine from Lewes owns a furniture business. He is moving his business over to sustainable bamboo products that are produced for him in China. Whilst there is no import duty on hardwood furniture, there is a 5.6 % duty on bamboo furniture set by the EU. Can the Commission explain why import duty is imposed on environmentally sustainable materials such as bamboo?
