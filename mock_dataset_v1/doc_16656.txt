WRITTEN QUESTION E-2941/08 by Katerina Batzeli (PSE) and Evangelia Tzampazi (PSE) to the Commission (23 May 2008) Subject: Circulation of contaminated sunflower oil imported from Ukraine In mid‑April, a warning was received from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed that sunflower oil contaminated with mineral oil and extremely dangerous to public health had entered the Greek market and the markets of other EU Member States. According to the authorities, the oil had been imported from Ukraine. About one month after the issuing of this warning, the Greek authorities have failed to indicate the exact quantities imported. In addition, it is not known to what extent the contaminated sunflower oil has been marketed and used either for direct consumption or the manufacture of other food products many of which are intended for direct consumption. Does the Commission consider that Rapid Alert System is adequate and that it is being implemented in such a way as to guarantee that consumers are protected from dangerous products? What monitoring and other procedures are Member States required to carry out and are the Greek authorities compling to the letter with the provisions of the relevant Community legislation? How does the Commission intend to improve procedures for the monitoring and supervision of food imports and the marketing thereof so as to ensure that they can be traced and tht such dangerous situations can be averted?
