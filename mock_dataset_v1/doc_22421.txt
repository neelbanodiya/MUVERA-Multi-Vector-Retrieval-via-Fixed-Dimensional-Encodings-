competent national court. In the case mentioned in the question, the competent NEB should be the one in Cyprus, which the Commission has already contacted in this instance. It is in the remit of this national authority to clarify whether, in the mentioned case, re-routing was offered at the earliest opportunity according to the regulation. The Commission is actively monitoring the activity of NEBs in order to ensure a uniform application and enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, notably as regards the interpretation of Article 8.1.b, which is relevant in this particular case.
