with liquidity problems. In addition to these actions and in response to the conclusions from the June 2009 European Council, Commission has now finalised an in-depth analysis of the dairy market, aiming to identify the causes for the serious situation in 2009 and to discuss further stabilising options while respecting the outcome of the Health Check. This report COM(2009)385. was adopted on 22 July 2009 by the Commission. It sets out a number of further steps which the Commission considers could potentially help resolve the sector's current difficulties. These options were discussed for the first time by the Council on 7 September 2009. However, quota system changes such as the elimination of the quota increases and the cancellation of the decision to end quota system as requested by the Honourable Members would not respect the outcome of the Health Check. Therefore, in recognition of the parameters set by the Council for this report, such initiatives are not included in the options presented by the Commission. As regards taking steps towards a new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the debate on the CAP post 2013 is now getting underway. A formal communication on the CAP after 2013 will be published by the Commission in the summer/early autumn of 2010.
