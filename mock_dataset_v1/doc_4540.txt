Answer given by Mr Barrot on behalf of the Commission (25 July 2006) In the light of concerns that airport capacity will increasingly constrain the development of air traffic, the Commission published in September 2005 a consultation paper on the subject of ‘Airport capacity, efficiency and safety’. It received 60 answers, which were all published on the Commission’s Internet site http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air/consultation/2005_11_30_en.htm . Among the replies, there was one from an Irish regional airport and one from an Irish airline. In the light of its analysis of the responses, the Commission is currently elaborating a communication which will develop themes such as the following : — make better use of existing airport capacity and integrate airports into the air traffic management (ATM) network; — improve the planning framework for new airport infrastructure by improving the information flow between airports and neighbouring planning authorities as to their spatial and noise impact and by developing best practice guidelines to help promote improved coordination of airport plans and wider land-use plans; — promote ‘co-modality’, the integration and collaboration of different transport modes in order to improve airport access and to make more combined air-rail journeys possible; — work towards parallel improvements to air transport safety; — develop and implement new technology (now and during the Single European Sky ATM research (SESAR) development and deployment phase). The Commission communication on the subject is planned for autumn 2006.
