Question for written answer E-010175/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (8 November 2011) Subject: Humanitarian workers abducted in Algeria During the night of Saturday, 22 October 2011 a dozen men broke into the Rabuni refugee camp in the self-proclaimed Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Algeria and abducted Italian aid worker Rossella Urru and two Spanish colleagues of hers; to date, there has been no news of their whereabouts. Ms Urru, International Committee for the Development of Peoples (CISP) coordinator in the Sahrawi refugee camps, has been working in Algeria for two years as coordinator of a Commission-funded project. According to the Sahrawi Foreign Minister, Mohamed Salem Ould Salek, the kidnappers have taken the hostages to Mali and their aim is both to secure a ransom and to spread fear among humanitarian workers and destabilise the Tindouf region. The kidnappers' identity is not yet known for certain, although there are suspicions that al-Qaeda was responsible. Given that a large number of humanitarian workers have been kidnapped or attacked in various countries and that no reliable news has been received as to the whereabouts of Rossella Urru and her colleagues, does the Commission intend to take special steps to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers involved in EU projects in third countries?
