WRITTEN QUESTION E-2670/09 by Mario Mauro (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (8 April 2009) Subject: The Madoff case In view of the impact of the Madoff case on the European market, and the fact that: — UCITS law stipulates that the depositary bank should always have sight and custody of the securities, even if deposited with other ‘subcustodians’ and those of the managers was not complied with, resulting in general depreciation, so that the managers’ shares as well as their funds fell in value; since, moreover, if the banks were allowed not to refund the underwriters’ money, the entire operation and credibility of the European banking system would be compromised and since, in a similar situation, this could be considered to constitute discrimination between the conduct required of banks and that required of private citizens, could the Commission provide clarification of this issue and say if it will be taking steps to safeguard European citizens’ savings?
