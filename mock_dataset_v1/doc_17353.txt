the new Constitution's provisions in this area have not been questioned during the ratification process; underlines therefore that the CFSP could also play an important role in reinforcing the European project in public opinion and in demonstrating the advantages of the relevant parts of the Constitutional Treaty; 9. Regrets, in this respect, the attitude of some Members States which, in spite of the adoption of the Constitution by the European Council, have used the right of veto in important foreign affairs matters for domestic reasons; calls, therefore, on all Member States to act in a constructive manner in line with the spirit of the Constitution; 10.
