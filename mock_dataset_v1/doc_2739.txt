WRITTEN QUESTION E-3071/08 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (2 June 2008) Subject: Problems at the border between Italy and Switzerland Crossing the border between Italy and Switzerland is becoming increasingly chaotic. The most recent episode occurred on 12 May, Whit Monday, which is a public holiday in Switzerland, when the Brogeda crossing was closed. Huge tailbacks of lorries started forming on the Italian side at the Como Sud motorway toll booths in the morning, blocking the Como-Milan motorway. At 11 a.m. on Tuesday, 13 May, there was still a tailback, but traffic had started moving again a few hours earlier. The situation did not return to normal until the evening. Road hauliers are angered by this situation and consider it unacceptable for trade to be hampered unilaterally in this manner. The partnership agreements that Switzerland has concluded with the European Union need to be made more rigorous. Eighteen months ago, tolls rose by 30 % without road hauliers and ordinary motorists gaining anything in return. Irrespective of their origin, hold-ups and the chaos they cause are not just exasperating for those caught up in them for hours — and in some cases, days — but are also harmful. Given that the situation is becoming increasingly unbearable as such hold-ups become more and more common, would the Commission not agree that new agreements should be concluded with a view to harmonising border crossing opening times and preventing problems from occurring during public holidays on both sides of the border?
