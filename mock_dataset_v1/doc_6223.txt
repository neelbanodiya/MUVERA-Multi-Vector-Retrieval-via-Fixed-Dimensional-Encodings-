Question for written answer E-006597/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Stavrakakis (S&D) (12 July 2011) Subject: Simplification of Cohesion Policy The complicated management and control rules regarding both the policy itself and the legislation governing public procurement are cited as one of the most important causes for the high rate of errors recorded in the implementation of Cohesion Policy programmes. It has been proposed that a further simplification of the rules could play a key role in reducing this rate of errors and facilitate management by the bodies concerned. Will the Commission say if any data are available on the impact of the simplification initiatives that it has promoted itself to date? Furthermore, does it plan to present other proposals to further simplify the rules, especially in areas where high rates of errors are recorded?
