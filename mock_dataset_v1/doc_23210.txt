Question for written answer E-7030/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Giommaria Uggias (ALDE) , Niccolò Rinaldi (ALDE) and Luigi de Magistris (ALDE) (16 September 2010) Subject: Tax shield and Commission's belated reply With this question we wish to condemn the unacceptable behaviour of the services of the Commission, which is essentially failing to account for its own actions when subjected to the scrutiny of members of this Parliament and therefore of Parliament itself. Further to our tabling of a question on 18 March 2010 (E‑2036/10) concerning the Italian legislation known as the ‘tax shield’, we received a reply the content of which appears to be evasive and incomplete and fails to provide a genuine de jure and de facto reply to the questions raised. This is all the more serious in the light of the fact that on 11 November 2009, a complaint was submitted to the Commission with a view to verifying the compatibility of the ‘tax shield’ with Community law. No reply has yet been received, even though the file was sent to the Commission services nearly a year ago. We therefore reserve the right to contact the European Ombudsman with regard to this failure of the Commission to fulfil its duties. Meanwhile, can the Commission explain its behaviour and — bearing in mind that by failing to reply to the complaint in question it is causing considerable damage to the Community budget, given that a substantial amount of resources are not actually entering the EU's coffers — provide a proper and exhaustive reply?
