WRITTEN QUESTION E-6051/09 by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) and Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Commission (3 December 2009) Subject: Piracy off the coast of Somalia Acts of piracy off the coast of Somalia have been escalating since September. For example, 36 people from the vessel Alakrana will have been in captivity for a month and a half. Even though the Atalanta force has shown its effectiveness in the Gulf of Aden, the recent attacks suggest that the pirates’ capacities are growing, as they have stepped up their activity off the coast of East Africa, 200 nautical miles north of the Seychelles and 650 miles off the Somali coast in the case of the latest attack. Does the European Commission agree with the feasibility of solving the problem of piracy off the coast of Somalia in the way approved in the EP resolution of 14 October 2008? Does the European Commission agree with the idea of sending military escorts, as in the case of French vessels, fishing vessels and cargo ships? Could this military force be composed of European military personnel along the lines of EU NAVFOR? What is the position of the European Commission on the IMO’s recommendations not to carry private security agencies on vessels, whether fishing or trading? What are the possibilities for a combination of private and military forces, and what are the legal implications? How can the European Commission put pressure on the Member States to set up a permanent legal instrument to bring arrested pirates to trial? In the view of the European Commission, could the regional agreement signed in January 2009 in Djibouti between the Coastal States of the Gulf of Aden under the aegis of the IMO contribute to finding a local solution to the piracy problem and help the Somali authorities to tackle this problem?
