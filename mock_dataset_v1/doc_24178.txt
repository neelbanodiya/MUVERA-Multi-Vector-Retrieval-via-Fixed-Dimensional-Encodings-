such as a Euro-Mediterranean energy community, to ensure security of supply; Underlying principles and recommendations for action within a common European foreign policy on energy A. Diversification 16. Is of the opinion that, taking into consideration the increasing dependence of the EU on a limited number of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes, it is essential to support the priority initiatives aimed at their diversification, both geographically and by developing sustainable alternatives; believes that special priority should be given to environmentally safe and renewable energy sources; considers that security of supply at affordable and predictable prices must be a major goal for the EU; 17. Supports the prioritisation of all the energy diversification projects realised within the neighbourhood – especially those aimed at creating new transport corridors which diversify both suppliers and routes, such as the Trans-Caspian/trans-Black Sea energy corridor – in particular the construction of the Nabucco pipeline, liquefied natural gas infrastructure (LNG), the interconnection of electricity grids and the completion of the Euro-Mediterranean electricity and gas infrastructure rings as well as the realisation of new oil infrastructure projects of European interest such as the Odessa-Gdańsk and Constanta-Trieste projects which should be included in the list of high-priority projects of European interest; 18. Welcomes the nomination of EU coordinators for priority projects of European interest, as defined by the European Council in the Presidency Conclusions of March 2007, in particular for the Nabucco project and the Power-Link between Germany, Poland and Lithuania; 19. Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pursue active policies at the highest political level so as to enable the Community to diversify its natural gas sources; expects that any cooperation between gas exporting countries would respect an open, transparent and competitive market; considers that an initiative to create a gas version of OPEC would be contrary to that aim; 20. Notes that it is essential to move beyond declarations and open bids for concrete priority projects, and calls for the High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, upon being appointed, to be also responsible for coordinating the engagement in developing external energy infrastructure, such as the Nabucco and Odessa-Gdańsk projects; meanwhile, calls on the Commission, the Presidency and the SG/HR to strengthen the commitment to developing external energy infrastructures, together with the European coordinators; 21. Considers that the realisation of the energy diversification projects should be one of the priorities of the strengthened European
