Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (7 December 2005) The Commission cannot rule out the possibility that the transport of untreated household waste in the near vicinity of ferry passengers poses a risk to their health, even though the main problem in this case seems to be one of nuisance through odours. The Commission is of the opinion that the shipment of waste, also within Member States, should neither endanger human health nor cause a nuisance through noise or odours. This principle, which is explicitly laid down in Article 4 of the Waste Framework Directive Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste, OJ L 194, 25.7.1975. for the processes and methods of waste disposal and recovery, should also be respected by collectors and transporters of waste.
