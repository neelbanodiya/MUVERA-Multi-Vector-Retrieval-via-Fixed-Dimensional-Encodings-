It urged for the immediate release of all political prisoners. As soon as all prisoners are freed and arbitrary arrests have ceased the EU Council and Commission should determine a global policy towards Cuba. MEPs condemned the 44-years old US embargo of Cuba, favouring instead a policy aimed at the adoption of positive measures such as the signing and application of international human rights treaties and encouraging both authorities and democratic opposition to work together for a peaceful democratic transition. Such a policy should include incentives such as generous cooperation programmes, so as to improve respect for human rights at all levels. Parliament deplored the recent deterioration of the human rights situation in Cuba, with the arrests of and severe sentences after summary trials for more than 70 dissidents and human rights activists and the resumed use of the death penalty. As a result, the EU has decided to limit bilateral high-level governmental visits, to reduce the profile of Member States' participation in cultural events, to invite Cuban dissidents to national day celebrations and to re-evaluate its stated policy towards Cuba. The EU Commission has decided to suspend its evaluation on the Cuban request for accession to the ACP, upon which Cuba withdrew its request. MEPs deplored the Cuban decision to reject EU aid, as well as the lack of economic and social reforms, which, they said, is making the daily lives of Cuban citizens harder. Parliament asked for last year's Sakharov Prize winner Oswaldo Payá Sardiñas and Cuban opposition leader to be invited as soon as possible for an official visit to the EU.
