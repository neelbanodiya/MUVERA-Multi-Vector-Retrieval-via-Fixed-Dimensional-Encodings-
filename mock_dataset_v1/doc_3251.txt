in 2011. Therefore, deducing from the appropriations available the current amount requested (EUR 6.247.415) an amount of EUR 483.381.264 remains available until the end of 2011. This will leave more than 25% of the maximum annual amount earmarked for the EGF available for allocations during the last four month on 2011, as required by art. 12(6) of the EGF Regulation. III. Procedure The Commission has presented a transfer request in order to enter specific commitment appropriations in the 2011 budget, as required in Point 28 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006. The trilogue on the Commission's proposal for a Decision on the mobilisation of the EGF could take a simplified form, as provided for in Article 12(5) of the legal base, unless there is no agreement between the Parliament and the Council. According to an internal agreement, the Employment and Social Affairs Committee (EMPL) should be associated to the process, in order to provide constructive support and contribution to the assessment of the applications from the Fund. Following its evaluation, the EMPL committee of the European Parliament will give its view on the mobilisation of the Fund, which will be attached as letter to the present report. The Joint Declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, adopted during the conciliation meeting on 17 July 2008, has confirmed the importance of ensuring a rapid procedure with due respect of the Interinstitutional Agreement for the adoption of decisions on the mobilisation of the Fund.
