I directly started as reporting member for chapter five (External aid, Development and Enlargement) of the Court’s Annual Report for the financial year 2010. It was a unique opportunity to immediately involve myself in the detailed DAS audit work and quickly familiarize myself with the Annual Report procedure. Simultaneously I took up the responsibility of the performance audit on the effectiveness of EU development aid for food security in sub-Saharan Africa. I expect the resulting Special Report to be published during the first quarter of 2012. I also took up the task of a performance audit on the Commission’s management of external assistance to “fragile states” where state structures lack political capacity to provide basic functions that are needed for poverty reduction, development and to safeguard security and human rights of populations. After finalizing the preliminary study the audit work should start early 2012 with a Special Report publication foreseen in April 2013. Personal objectives for a possible future mandate My immediate priority will be to actively contribute to the discharge 2010 debate for External Actions with the European Parliament and the Committee
