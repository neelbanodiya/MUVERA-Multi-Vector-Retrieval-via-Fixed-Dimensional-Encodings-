WRITTEN QUESTION P-2283/06 by Agustín Díaz de Mera García Consuegra (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (17 May 2006) Subject: Death in the Atlantic In the months of November and December 2005 alone, between 1200 and 1700 people lost their lives in the Atlantic trying to reach the coast of the Canaries. Experts claim that the tragedy now confronting us is only just beginning, since what we have seen hitherto is only the tip of the iceberg. The Spanish Government's proven inability to prevent the tragedy taking place in the Canaries demands immediate European Union intervention. Is the Commission aware of the extreme gravity of the situation? Is it aware that what has happened so far is only the beginning, and that the worst is to come? Is it going to take specific emergency cooperation measures to prevent mass exoduses and enable these human beings to place their hopes for the future in their countries of origin?
