In a resolution establishing priorities for an EU migration policy, the European Parliament underlined the need for well-managed legal immigration, as legal channels were needed to counter illegal immigration. MEPs had called, already in 2007, for a blue card to facilitate the entry of highly qualified migrants to take jobs in sectors suffering skills shortages. Subsequently, Parliament supported the scheme developed by the European Commission, but urged Member States to avoid a brain-drain from third countries. Resolution adopted by EP: 26.09.07 by 557 in favour, 101 against and 22 abstentions EP vote: 20.11.2008 (consultation) Call for free access to labour markets for new Member States Parliament called on "old" Member States to open their labour markets to workers from the new Member States, putting an end to the transitional measures restricting access to workers from eight new Member States until 2011. Most countries have subsequently opened their labour markets to workers from all the EU, but at the end of 2008 restrictions remained in Belgium, Denmark, Austria and Germany. EP vote: 05.04.2006 Sanctions against employers who illegally employ third-country nationals Parliament adopted the legislative resolution on the crackdown on employers of illegal immigrants, following the vote on the amendments in Strasbourg on 4 February. At the time, MEPs decided to postpone the final vote at the request of the rapporteur Claudio FAVA (PES, IT) to allow the addition of a declaration providing reassurance that this directive will not prevent further legislation on subcontractors. Between 4.5 and 8 million illegal immigrants work in the construction, farming, hotel and other sectors in the EU. One of the factors encouraging illegal immigration into the EU is the possibility of finding work. This legislation aims to reduce that pull factor by targeting the employment of third-country nationals who are illegally staying in the EU.
