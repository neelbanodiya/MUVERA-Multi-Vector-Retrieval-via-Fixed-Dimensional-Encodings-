WRITTEN QUESTION E-2327/10 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (12 April 2010) Subject: Genetically modified cotton The acreage devoted to genetically modified cotton is increasing in several regions of the world. However, the traces of GM cotton are lost after harvesting. No official information is available about whether and to what extent this cotton is used in the manufacture of textiles. It is therefore impossible for the consumer to trace the countries of origin of textiles manufactured with genetically modified cotton and to know the extent to which these have been, and continue to be, imported into the EU. Even for retail chains with rigorous quality controls it is not always a simple matter to completely exclude GM cotton, as the recent organic cotton scandal involving H&M, C&A and Tchibo has shown. In the case of cotton fibres, (dyed) threads or textiles it is not easy to obtain meaningful information, since factors such as impurities, pesticides and contamination during transport (traces from other fields or of other products such as soya, rape, etc.) can call into question the reliability of the findings. The most reliable result would be that from seed testing. 1. Does the Commission have any information about the extent to which genetically modified cotton is present in textiles imported into the EU? 2. What are the countries of origin of these textiles? 3. Are detailed checks made on this point? 4. Have any studies been made of whether textiles made with GMO products have any effects on the wearer? 5. How can environmentally aware consumers avoid buying GM-contaminated textiles since these are not labelled? 6. Are there plans to introduce such labelling for textiles?
