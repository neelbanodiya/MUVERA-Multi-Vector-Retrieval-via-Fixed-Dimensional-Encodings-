Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (14 September 2011) The Commission is undertaking a process to modify the targets of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region (EUSDR). This takes into account the concerns raised by the Member States and the Parliament. New and clearer targets, including for navigability, will be presented to the High Level Group for the EUSDR scheduled to meet for the first time in autumn 2011. The new targets take into account the Joint Statement on the Development of Inland Navigation and Environmental Protection in the Danube River Basin. They have been subject to thorough discussions with the different stakeholders involved, especially through the Steering Groups working with the Priority Area Coordinators for the implementation of the strategy. The Commission, through its involvement in the monitoring of the action plan, reporting at the Annual Forum and in particular through the 2012 report, will continue the close cooperation with the Member States in making sure that the desired results are achieved.
