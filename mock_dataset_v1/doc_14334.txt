Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2007) Following its commitments during the accession negotiations Bulgaria closed down units 1 and 2 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant (KNPP) in 2002 and closed units 3 and 4 at the end of 2006. Bulgaria plans to continue operating units 5 and 6 of KNPP. Currently, the Commission has no evidence that Bulgaria will not implement its obligations regarding KNPP as laid down by the Treaty of Accession. As regards the further development of nuclear energy in Bulgaria the Commission refers to its recent answer to Written Question E‑4949/06 by Mr Beglitis.
