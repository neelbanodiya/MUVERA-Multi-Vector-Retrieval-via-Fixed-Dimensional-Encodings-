Question for written answer E-011255/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Godfrey Bloom (EFD) (30 November 2011) Subject: Company capital Where the Lehne report ( P7_TA(2011)0477 ) on company capital refers to ‘companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union’, does the Commission accept that this definition encompasses not just companies (whether public or private) incorporated under the United Kingdom’s Companies Act but also to all other forms of business enterprises, other than those which are not profit-making?
