WRITTEN QUESTION E-2953/04 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Council (23 November 2004) Subject: Rise in inflation and the volume of counterfeit euro banknotes The press in the eurozone and all the Eurostat surveys have registered the public's perception that prices rose when the euro was introduced on 1 January 2002. Eurostat Bulletin No. 58 published in May 2003 reported that 77% of the public in the eurozone consider that prices have been rounded upwards, while in Greece that figure rises to 88% and in the Netherlands to 91%. Furthermore, there are constant allegations that counterfeit euro notes are in circulation. Nevertheless, the Council gave an assurance in its answer to written question No. E-3451/03 OJ C that there was no great increase in prices following the introduction of the euro, while noting that the volume of counterfeit euro notes is much smaller than the volume of counterfeit national notes (answer to Question No. H-0013/03 Written answer of 12.3.2003 ). Why does the Council contradict both the Eurostat surveys and the members of the public who take part in those surveys as well as the press, which provides detailed substantiation of these allegations?
