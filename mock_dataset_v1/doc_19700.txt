The financial regulators will have the necessary information to help them understand the role played by speculation, and the appropriate tools to intervene if necessary in the event that these markets malfunction; In addition to these measures relating to European financial legislation, sectoral measures will if necessary be taken in order to address the problems specific to the underlying physical markets.

Efforts are currently being made to improve the range, quality and accessibility of this tool.
