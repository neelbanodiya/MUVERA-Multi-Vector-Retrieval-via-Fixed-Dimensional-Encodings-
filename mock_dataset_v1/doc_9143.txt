next financial framework; believes this measure to be long overdue and that the budgetisation of the EDF should take place at the earliest possible date; Development priorities 5. Recalls the Commission's commitment Commission Declaration concerning Article 5 DCI, Annex to the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament of 24 October 2006 ( COM(2006)0628 ). to ensuring that a benchmark of 20 % of its allocated assistance under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) is dedicated to basic and secondary education and basic health; calls for reporting against the same benchmark to be provided for the EDFs; calls on the Commission to prioritise support to strengthen health systems by focusing especially on targeting the poorest people, to improve the quality of learning and to help establish a policy framework which favours the poor and which is gender responsive; calls on the Commission to take full account of the recommendations by the Court of Auditors as formulated in its Special Reports No 10/2008 and 12/2010; calls on the Commission to increase this share to 25 % in the future; urges the Commission to place greater emphasis on maternal health and stresses the importance of education and awareness of sexual and reproductive health as an integral part of the women's health agenda, since this is the Millennium Development Goal in respect of which progress has been most disappointing; 6.
