measures provided for in the initiative are taken exclusively by the judicial authorities of either the issuing State or the executing State and in the framework of criminal proceedings. Amendments 11, 12, 13, 14 and 18 are aimed directly at the heart of the initiative, namely its scope. Your rapporteur considers that, for the purposes of issuing a freezing order, the maximum length (three years) of the sentence which may be imposed in respect of an offence to which verification of double criminality does not apply is excessive and should therefore be reduced to two years, failing which many proceeds of an offence will wrongly remain beyond the reach of the law. Your rapporteur also believes that the Member States should not make execution in the case of offences which are not specifically listed in the initiative subject to double criminality or dependent on whether or not freezing in such cases is allowed under a Member State’s domestic law. The purpose of amendments 6 and 19 is to provide for judicial review of decisions and to stipulate the cases in which actions should be launched in the executing State; actions relating to substance should always be lodged in the issuing State. Lastly, your rapporteur firmly believes that the framework decision must be brought into effect as a matter of urgency as a means of combating crime (organised or otherwise) and also that it could come into force earlier than is suggested in the legislative proposal. This is the reason for amendments 20 and 21.
