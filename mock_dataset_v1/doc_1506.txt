WRITTEN QUESTION P-0935/09 by Péter Olajos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 February 2009) Subject: Ecological thinking under the Commission's Danube Strategy On 6 October 2008, the Commissioner for Regional policy, Danuta Hübner, announced her intention to promote a European Danube Strategy. As she put it, this would ‘need a targeted policy for the Danube that meets its ecological, transport and socioeconomic needs’. Will the Commission describe what thinking has been developed about the Danube Delta's ecological needs and specifically how this will be incorporated during development of this strategy?
