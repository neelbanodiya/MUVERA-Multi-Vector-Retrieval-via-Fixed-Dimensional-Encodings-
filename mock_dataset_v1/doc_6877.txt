Answer given by Mr Kovács on behalf of the Commission (24 June 2005) Under Community customs law, all customs declarations have to be accompanied by all the documents required for the implementation of the provisions governing the customs procedure for which the goods are declared, including proofs of preferential origin. The customs authorities verify the correctness of these documents by applying risk management techniques. The technical arrangement on rules of origin with Israel is being implemented by the Member States since 1 February 2005 and none of them has informed the Commission that it created an exceptional administrative burden for their customs authorities. The EU has no competence to interfere in the organisation of customs controls by third countries participating in the system of pan-Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin. However, in case EU customs authorities have reasonable doubts that goods produced from materials covered by irregular proofs of origin are exported to the Community under the preferential trade agreements between the EU and other pan-Euro-Mediterranean partner countries, the EU customs authorities will activate the relevant procedures for administrative cooperation. The Commission has no indication that the technical arrangement would be abandoned or not be implemented correctly by Israel.
