Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (26 March 2007) The principles governing accession negotiations with Turkey are set out in the negotiating framework of 3 October 2005. The negotiating framework provides that advancement of the negotiations will be guided by Turkey's progress in preparing for accession, and that progress will be measured, inter alia , against the requirements of the Copenhagen political criteria, which include freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is a fundamental value of the European Union. As such, it is included as a short-term priority in the Accession Partnership for Turkey. In its progress report, published on 8 November 2006 COM(2006)649 final. , the Commission expressed concern about the limitations to freedom of expression in Turkey, and in particular Article 301 of the Turkish penal code, which has been used to prosecute non-violent opinions. In the past months, the Turkish Government initiated a consultation with civil society organisations to prepare amendments to Article 301 of the Turkish penal code. The Commission is closely following these developments, and has indicated that provisions restricting freedom of expression should be brought into line with the relevant European standards.
