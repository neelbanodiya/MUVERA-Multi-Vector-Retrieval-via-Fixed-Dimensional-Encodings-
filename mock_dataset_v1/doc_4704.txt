of the European Union; 2. Stresses that, although the 2004 enlargement caused disturbances on the agricultural and food markets of certain new Member States, it contributed significantly to the development of well-established market relations in the 25 Member States as a whole; 3. Points out that the agriculture and food sector in both the new and old Member States benefited at least partially from the enlargement – stakeholders in the new Member States benefited from the higher level of agricultural support and from the increase of trade possibilities, while the food-processing industry and international trade in the old Member States progressed, and there was a higher level of investment and a rise in turnover in the retail sector, in particular in the run-up to enlargement; 4.

Stresses the fact that enlargement has not increased the risk level as regards food safety and animal and plant health, and notes in this respect that the standards and efficiency of the work of the competent authorities in the new Member States are above the EU average in certain aspects; 6.

Laments the fact that higher quotas were not allocated for either the 2004 or 2007 enlargement, if only at the level initially planned; Application of the CAP in the new Member States 8. Notes that the considerable differences between the agricultural sectors of the new Member States result in differences in the
