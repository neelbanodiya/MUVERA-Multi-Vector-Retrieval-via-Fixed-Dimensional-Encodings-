Answer given by Ms Wallstrom on behalf of the Commission (21 April 2006) All contracts awarded in the field of communication are based on the annual work programme of the Directorate-General (DG) for Communication. The work programme for the procurements and the grants planned by DG Communication in 2006 provides information on the objectives, the actions and the related procedures which will be implemented. This work programme is available on the Europa website at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/communication/grants/index_en.htm. The Honourable Member will find on the same website all the available information on contracts awarded so far. This website is updated regularly. As regards future plans, the Commission has recently adopted a White Paper on a European communication policy. The White Paper foresees a six month consultation period (until 1 July 2006) with all the stakeholders concerned — the EU institutions, Member States’ governments at national, regional and local level, European political parties and civil society — in order to propose ways of closing the communication gap between the European Union and its citizens based on a new approach building on a genuine dialogue between the people and the policymakers. At the end of this consultation period the Commission will summarise the results and draw up a plan for concrete actions by all the stakeholders.
