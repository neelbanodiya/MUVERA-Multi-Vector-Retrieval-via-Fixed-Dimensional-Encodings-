WRITTEN QUESTION E-1328/05 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (8 April 2005) Subject: US-EU agreement on rice On 1 March 2005 the United States and the European Union reached a trade agreement on the import regime for brown rice at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva. The relevant Italian trade organisations have expressed deep regret at the substance of the agreement which they regard as highly penalising for Italian rice farmers as it includes the application of new tariffs and new quantities for the import of brown rice from the USA. 1. What is the Commission's assessment of this agreement? 2. Is it correct that agreement goes well beyond the concessions that could have been made to the United States? 3. Does the Commission not consider that this agreement, together with the EBA protocol, which provides for imports of rice from the least developed countries at zero rates of duty and without physical quotas, seriously threatens to destabilise the European and Italian rice market, causing incalculable damage to the whole rice sector? 4. Following the damage caused by the opening-up of the textile and clothing market to China, why does the Union insist on taking decisions when it knows that they will damage entire sectors of production? 5. Is there any quid pro quo for the concessions made by the EU to the USA?
