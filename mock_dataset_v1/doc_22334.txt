2002/C 205 E/204 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0683/02 by Miquel Mayol i Raynal (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (12 March 2002) Subject: EU-Algeria trade On 19 December 2001 the EU and Algeria signed an association agreement. This agreement provides, in particular, for a trade regime for agricultural products, relating to the EU's exports to Algeria of cereals, sugar and oilseeds and its imports from Algeria of vegetables, olive oil, fruit juice and wine. Algeria further undertakes to phase out its tariff barriers to enable the entry of industrial exports from the EU. Although the establishment of these relations is to be welcomed and it is to be hoped that they will contribute to the restoration of peace and respect for human rights in Algeria, it has nonetheless to be stressed that the resultant trade flow will, once again, create competition for the products of southern Europe, which are already in circumstances of crisis, while redounding to the benefit of well-off farmers and industrialists in northern Europe. Does the Commission agree with this analysis? If so, what compensatory measures does it intend to take in support of southern European producers?
