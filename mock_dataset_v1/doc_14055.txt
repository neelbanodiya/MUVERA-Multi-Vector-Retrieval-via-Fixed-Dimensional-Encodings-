Question for written answer E-010299/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sir Graham Watson (ALDE) (16 November 2011) Subject: Israeli detention of minors on the West Bank The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) requires signatory states to recognise the right of every child accused of breaking the penal law ‘to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child’s sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child’s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child’s age and the desirability of promoting the child’s reintegration and the child’s assuming a constructive role in society’ (Article 40). The UNCRC does not specify a minimum age of criminal responsibility: however, the United Nations committee responsible for monitoring compliance with the convention has criticised jurisdictions which prosecute children below the minimum age of 12. Israel is a signatory to the UNCRC, and its minimum age of criminal responsibility is 12 years. 1. Is the Commission aware of the detention by the Israeli authorities of minors below the age of 12; including the detention for 10 hours of Ammeer Muhtasseb, aged nine, on 24 February 2010? 2. Is the Commission aware that Palestinian minors held by the Israeli authorities are denied access to their parents until their trial? 3. Is the Commission aware that many children do not have access to legal representation until minutes before the opening of their trial?
