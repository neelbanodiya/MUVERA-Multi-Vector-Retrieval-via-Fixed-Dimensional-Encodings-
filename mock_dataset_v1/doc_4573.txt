Reply (20 February 2006) The EU has consistently spoken in favour of democratic reform in the Maldives. It therefore welcomes the proposal to create a fully democratic multi-party system there. It notes, however, that a genuine commitment to democracy requires living up to the spirit as well as the letter of reform. The reform process needs to be undertaken in a truly inclusive manner, involving all stakeholders and the wider public of the Maldives, in order to raise awareness and confidence. President Gayoom announced his proposals for constitutional reforms in June 2004. Since then four political parties have registered for the first time. Unfortunately, however, only a few months later, a number of opposition activists face very serious charges and are alleging human rights violations. The progress so far towards the introduction of a multi-party system may therefore best be described as mixed. The EU will continue to pay close attention to the conduct and progress of all investigations. The EU provides substantial assistance to the Maldives, particularly since the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004. The EU has been actively involved in advancing the democratic reform process in the Maldives, particularly since August 2004. The EU also supports work by others in this direction, and commends the good offices of the Commonwealth Secretary-General's Special Envoy. There are no plans by any of the EU Member States to open a mission in Male, but the Council continues to follow the process closely through frequent visits by EU Heads of Mission in Colombo.
