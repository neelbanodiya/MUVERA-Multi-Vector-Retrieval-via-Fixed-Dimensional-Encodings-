is frequently far higher than the actual level of catches, which unfortunately tally with the actual state of stocks, which are scarce. In fact, the upshot of this tendency for TACs to be set at higher levels than those recommended on the basis of scientific data and which do not correspond to catches has been that the overall TACs set for many species have never in fact been a restrictive measure to prevent the over-exploitation of stocks, reducing fishing mortality. In short, the setting of annual TACs by the Council has been guided more by socio-economic and political considerations than by criteria relating to the strict conservation of stocks. Not only that, it has also ignored the real situation as evidenced by data relating to actual catches. The overall outcome of this failure of policy on the conservation of resources is that, at present, according to the data provided in April 2000 by the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, of the 240 species of interest for the Community fisheries analysed, embracing both Community and international waters, stocks of only 40 species can be considered to be in a state which conforms to the rules of the precautionary principle; 80 species, including such valuable commercial species as hake and cod, are at imminent risk of collapse or over-exploitation. Moreover, the development of the spawning biomass between 1994 and 1998 and fishing mortality levels in the 1990s make it possible to deduce that Community policy on the reduction of the fleet as implemented through the multiannual guidance programmes has not proved effective in terms of ensuring the recovery of Community fish stocks. This state of affairs - which has become clear from the crisis affecting cod stocks in the Scottish and North Sea areas, as a result of which urgent protection measures have needed to be taken such as the closing of fishing grounds until 30 April 2001 and the adoption of a rigorous long-term plan for the recovery of stocks, as well as from the collapse in northern hake stocks, which are now at levels which seriously threaten their continued existence, given that the biological safety limits have been exceeded in recent years, as shown by the scarce recruitment observed from 1997 to the present – has demonstrated the unavoidable need to adopt measures to cut fishing mortality to levels compatible with sustainable fishing, since we will be
