WRITTEN QUESTION E-4610/05 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (12 December 2005) Subject: Disbanding of the biggest federation of agricultural cooperatives in Greece The Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives of Thessaloniki consists of 147 agricultural cooperatives in the region and is the biggest in Greece. It has four processing plants for agricultural produce, 7.5 hectares of covered areas and land for building within the Thessaloniki conurbation, while being instrumental in reducing unemployment and absorbing the agricultural produce of the area. The Agricultural Bank of Greece had agreed (both with the administration appointed by PASOK governments and that appointed by the New Democracy government) on an arrangement to settle the debts of the Federation (which amounted to EUR 25 million) and regular payments were made up to the present time at which time 80 % of the debt had been repaid. Nevertheless, the current administration of the Agricultural Bank of Greece, headed by Mr Miliakos, recently announced that it did not recognise the above debt settlement agreement and that the Federation was to go into liquidation. The liquidators have in fact already moved into the Federation’s offices. Rumours are rife that the Federation’s land within the Thessaloniki conurbation is being targeted by certain interests that are seeking to set up large shopping centres. How can the Commission intervene to ensure that the Agricultural Bank of Greece respects the agreement which has been concluded? Can the Agricultural Bank of Greece revoke an agreement which had been concluded and was in operation, thereby leaving farmers and workers at the Federation’s plants unemployed?
