Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (1 September 2010) Since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union has the same legal value as the Treaties. In the same manner as no general guidelines have been issued on how to apply the Treaties as such, the Commission considers that, for the moment, there is no need for general guidelines for the Member States on how to apply the Charter. Concerning the interpretation of the Charter, Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the rights, freedoms and principles in the Charter shall be interpreted in accordance with the general provisions in Title VII of the Charter governing its interpretation and application and with due regard to the explanations referred to in the Charter Explanations relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, OJ C 303, 14.12.2007 . , that set out the sources of those provisions. As announced in the action plan implementing the Stockholm Programme COM(2010)171 final , the Commission will present in 2010 a Communication on the Fundamental Rights Policy. This communication will among other, address aspects of the application of the Charter by Member States when they are implementing Union law.
