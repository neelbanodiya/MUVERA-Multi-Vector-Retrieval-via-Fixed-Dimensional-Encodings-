information to their military and civilian personnel on mission, as well as to their professional organisations, about the probability that depleted uranium has been or might be used in their region of operations, and to take sufficient protective measures; 5. Calls on the Member States, the Council and the Commission to establish an environmental inventory of depleted uranium-contaminated areas (including testing ranges) and to provide full support – including financial support – for projects to assist victims and their relatives as well as for clean-up operations in the affected areas; 6. Calls on all EU Member States and NATO countries to work further towards a global ban – or, at the very least, a moratorium – on the use of depleted uranium weapons, and systematically to halt production and procurement of this type of weaponry; 7. Calls on the Member States and the Council to take the lead in working towards an international treaty - through the UN or through a 'coalition of the willing' - to establish a ban on the development, production, stockpiling, transfer, testing and use of uranium weapons as well as the destruction or recycling of existing stocks; 8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, NATO and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the UN, Euromil, the International Red Cross, the World Health Organisation and the International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons.
