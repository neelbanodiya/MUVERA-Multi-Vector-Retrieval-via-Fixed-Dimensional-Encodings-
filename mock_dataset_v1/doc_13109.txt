further deterioration of the environment being caused by foreign fishing vessels. There is no evidence to support this claim. Some EU vessels operating under the Indian Ocean Fisheries Partnership Agreements have already shifted their activities to other fishing grounds in the Atlantic and the Pacific. However, the numbers of alternative fishing possibilities are limited by the fact that any increase in fishing possibilities would depend on the state of the stocks in the fishing grounds covered by other bilateral or multilateral fisheries management regimes.
