particularly as regards agricultural and fisheries subsidies and other trade barriers; 17. Supports in particular the effort to provide world-wide assistance to increase employment opportunities, taking into account the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work; Better international governance 18. Considers that the central challenge is now to monitor and properly implement the Johannesburg action programme, to ensure that its targets are met and that the necessary steps are taken to meet its specific objectives; 19. Emphasises that the implementation of this agreement must be an inclusive process, involving all major groups, especially social partners, as sustainable development requires broad-based and democratic participation in policy formulation, decision-making, implementation and monitoring at all levels; 20.

Welcomes the contacts that were made between the parliamentarians attending the WSSD, including the meeting held under Interparliamentary Union auspices, and that between the European Parliament and the Council of Europe; believes that these constituted a useful first step towards the establishment of a parliamentary network to support sustainable development and to ensure greater parliamentary input into future international organisations and greater accountability to Parliament of relevant international organisations such as UNEP and the WTO; 25. Again emphasises that the input of Members of the European Parliament taking part in future EU delegations to international conferences would be reinforced if they were able to attend, if only as observers, the daily EU coordination meetings and proposes that the interinstitutional rules should be clarified as a matter of
