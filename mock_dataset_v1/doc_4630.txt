Question for written answer E-000757/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Hannu Takkula (ALDE) (4 February 2011) Subject: Promoting exemptions from visa requirements between EU Member States and Australia In Europe, EU citizens’ freedom of movement between countries has been eased. In the Schengen countries within the EU, exemption from visa requirements prevails and people are guaranteed freedom of movement between these countries (the Schengen Agreement is also applied to nationals of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). When citizens of the Nordic countries move between the Nordic countries, they need only to be able — where required — to demonstrate their identity and prove that they are nationals of one or other of those countries. When foreign nationals enter Australia and reside there, they are subject to fairly strict surveillance in accordance with the prevailing practices, including those relating to visas. In many respects this remains justified, but it would be desirable to achieve reciprocity in visa practices between the EU Member States and Australia. There are also historical reasons in favour of this in some cases, supported furthermore by the current close cooperation between Europe and Australia, as well as the fact that Australian nationals do not require a visa to travel in EU Member States/Schengen countries. Have the Commission and the Australian Government (Department of Immigration and Citizenship) discussed the possibility of introducing a complete exemption from visa requirements between EU Member States and Australia?
