Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (19 May 2006) Eurostat is not in a position to provide the elements of information demanded by the Honourable Member due to the fact that it was confirmed by the Greek authorities that, in the past, only a relatively small fraction of deliveries were ever captured, that no information on deliveries were received by the National Statistical Service of Greece (NSSG) and the Ministry of Finance since 1997, and therefore it was not possible to correctly implement the delivery method. Further information can be found by the Honourable Member in the ‘Report of Eurostat on the revision of the Greek Government deficit and debt figures’ (pages 15‑18) publicly available on the Eurostat website: http://epp.eurostat.cec.eu.int/portal/page?_pageid=1073,46587259&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL&p_product_code=GREECE
