2006 onwards earmarking is ruled out by the Financial Regulation, and access to these grants is instead decided on the basis of a call for proposals. Late publication of calls for proposals could restrict the range of eligible organisations able to apply. The Commission should ensure that the call for proposals is on track, open, fair and timely. European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) 2. OLAF has asked for 25 new staff and an increase in its budget of 10% in 2006. The Bösch report of 7 June 2005 on the protection of the financial interests of the Communities and fight against fraud posits the idea of setting up OLAF branch offices to monitor key smuggling centres P6_TA-2005-0218 , paragraph 38. . While OLAF should receive sufficient resources to deal with its workload and resolve cases more quickly, your draftsman feels that a satisfactory justification for this increase is needed, particularly given the findings of the Court of Auditors that OLAF already has sufficient resources European Court of Auditors' Special Report No 1/2005 concerning the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office, paragraph 19. , and assurances concerning the supervision and control of the Office's activities. SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Budgetary Control calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Calls on the Commission to ensure that the call for proposals for grants awarded under budget lines 15040103 (subsidy for cultural organisations advancing the idea of Europe) and 15060103 (grants to organisations advancing the idea of Europe) is on track, open, fair and timely. 2. (a) Grants the request by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) for additional resources on the basis of a satisfactory justification; (b) asks for assurances concerning the supervision and control of OLAF's activities.
