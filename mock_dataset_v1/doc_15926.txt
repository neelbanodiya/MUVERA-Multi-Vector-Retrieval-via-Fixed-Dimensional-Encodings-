WRITTEN QUESTION E-3057/09 by David Hammerstein (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (22 April 2009) Subject: Apiary sites The Valencian Autonomous Community allows phytosanitary treatment of flowering plants on sites where beehives are located. Phytosanitary products from the neonicotinoid family (Imidacloprid, Fipronil, Thiamethoxan, etc.), which have a high incidence of mortality on bees and other pollinators, are commonly used. These products are in fact banned in certain EU countries. Some scientists consider that these treatments contribute to colony collapse disorder. In many cases, this has meant hives within a radius of over two kilometers from the farm site treated with phytosanitary products being wiped out. The demise and destruction of beekeeping on this scale breaches EU legislation on plant protection. Does the Commission consider that this crop treatment contravenes Community law?
