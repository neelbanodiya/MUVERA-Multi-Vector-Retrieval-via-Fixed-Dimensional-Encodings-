Heading 5 strategy options The Rapporteurs are examining whether the Council's Draft Budget provides sufficient appropriations for the proper functioning of the institutions and any position that severely hinders the recruitment foreseen should be avoided. The Commission has argued that Council's cuts could freeze all recruitment, both non-enlargement and enlargement. The following main options could be considered: 1. To accept the Council’s Draft Budget and the cut of EUR 119.9 million compared to the PDB, leaving an important margin of EUR 130 million below the ceiling of Heading 5. This would mean accepting the Draft Budget. This is not estimated to be an option that could fulfil the real needs of the institutions. 2. To restore the PDB partially, leaving an adequate margin of around EUR 20-70 million . This would mean accepting all justified posts and restoring unreasonable cuts
