of food and feed. (14) Whilst considering MRLs of pesticides, it should also be recognised that few consumers are aware of the risks arising from pesticides. It would be valuable to fully explain such risks to the public. (15) Member States should look into the possibility of publishing the names of companies whose products contain higher pesticide residues than the maximum permitted levels. ( 16 ) Specific rules for animal feed including marketing, storage of feed and feeding of animals are provided for in Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed OJ L 140, 30.5.2002, p. 10. Directive as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/100/EC (OJ L 285, 1.11.2003, p. 33). . For certain products it is not possible to determine whether they will be transformed into food or animal feed. Therefore the pesticide residues in such products should be safe both for human and, where relevant, for animal consumption. Accordingly it is appropriate that the rules set out in this Regulation also apply to those products in addition to the specific rules for animal nutrition. ( 17 ) It is necessary to define at Community level certain terms used for the setting, control, and reporting on controls of MRLs for products of plant and animal origin. It is important that Member States apply proper sanctions in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules OJ L 165, 30.4.2004, p. 1. . ( 18 ) Directive 76/895/EEC provides that Member States may authorise higher levels of MRLs than are currently authorised at Community level. That possibility should cease to exist as, in view of the internal market, it could create obstacles to intra-Community trade. ( 19 ) The determination of MRLs for pesticides requires lengthy technical consideration and includes an assessment of potential risks to consumers. Therefore, MRLs cannot be set immediately for the residues of pesticides currently regulated by Directive 76/895/EEC or for pesticides for which Community MRLs have not yet been set. ( 20 ) It is appropriate that the minimum data requirements to be used when considering the setting of MRLs for pesticides be laid down at Community level. ( 21 ) In
