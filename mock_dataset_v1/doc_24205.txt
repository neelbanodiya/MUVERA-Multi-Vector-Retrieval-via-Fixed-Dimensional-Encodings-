Question for written answer P-002865/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Filip Kaczmarek (PPE) (22 March 2011) Subject: Humanitarian disaster in Japan The latest figures on the destruction caused in Japan by the earthquake and the tsunami are appalling. It is estimated that in the province of Miyagi alone, more than 10 000 lives have been lost, and over 3 000 people are thought to be missing. 63 000 homes have been destroyed, 450 000 people are living in shelters and a million have no access to water, heating or food. There is a need for medical and psychological care on the ground. This is a major humanitarian disaster. What volume of funding does the Commission intend to provide for humanitarian aid to the victims of the earthquake and the tsunami in Japan? How can Member States contribute in the long term to rebuilding the infrastructure in the worst-affected regions of Japan?
