Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (23 March 2011) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answer to Written Question E‑5767/09 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . As regards your reference to fraud, the Commission points out that criminal law remains within the competence of the Member States, as long as, and to the extent that, there is no EC law provision containing minimum rules on criminal offences and/or sanctions. There is currently no such minimum rule regarding criminal law protection of consumers in the context of auctions. The Commission therefore does not monitor systematically Member States' policies in this regard.
