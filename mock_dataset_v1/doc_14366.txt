WRITTEN QUESTION E-1030/05 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Commission (16 March 2005) Subject: Details of structural funds and investment in health and healthcare In his speech to The European Voice Conference ‘Healthcare: Is Europe getting better’ on 20 January 2005 (speech 05/24), the Health and Consumer Protection Commissioner, Markos Kyprianou, said that some Member States take advantage of the potential of the existing structural funds to support investment in health and healthcare but that ‘making the necessary [structural funds] investment depends on the regions and countries concerned identifying investment in health and health infrastructure as a priority for European support’. Could the Commission give specific examples of such investment, broken down by region and country? If possible, could it list all such projects identified by Ireland for the current round? Which of the projects identified by Ireland are receiving, or have received, European support?
