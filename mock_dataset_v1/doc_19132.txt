and then inform the discharge authority of what it has done; Budget transfers without supporting documents 6. Notes the Court of Auditors' statement that budget transfers were not properly justified, since no estimate of needs had been provided and the Administrative Board had not been informed; congratulates the Foundation, however, on having now remedied this shortcoming; Procurement procedures 7. Calls on the Foundation to take steps to improve the monitoring of its contracts and the programming of its procurement procedures, by issuing new invitations to tender well before the corresponding contracts come to an end; in that connection, emphasises the fact that the Court of Auditors states that in two cases the Foundation improperly extended a contract beyond the maximum authorised duration and that in another case it failed to provide any justification for using a negotiated procedure; Human resources 8. Calls on the Foundation’s management to take steps, as part of its human resources management policy and in keeping with its obligations concerning implementation of the budget, to make better provision in advance for the departure of key staff members; 9.

Congratulates the Foundation on having introduced, in 2008, recruitment procedures consistent with the recommendations made by the Court of Auditors in the last two years; in particular, notes that on this occasion the Court of Auditors no longer identifies shortcomings in the Foundation's recruitment procedures (for example as regards the selection criteria) which were such as to undermine the transparency and non-discriminatory nature of those procedures; Internal audit 11. Expresses concern at the fact that the Foundation’s financial statements for 2008 were inadequate and inconsistent with the 2007 accounts and consequently required substantial correction in the course of the audit; notes that this state of affairs can be explained by the fact that the Foundation was forced to recruit a temporary member of staff for a short period of time in order to close the 2008 accounts and that, in addition, the handover from one accounting officer to the next was not seamless; calls on the Foundation, therefore, to take steps to ensure that such a situation does not recur in the future; 12. Acknowledges that 26 out of the 54 recommendations made by the Internal Audit Service (IAS) have been implemented since 2006; notes that,
