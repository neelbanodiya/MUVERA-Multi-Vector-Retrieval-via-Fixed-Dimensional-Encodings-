Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (4 February 2010) The Commission is fully aware of the importance of business travel and is in regular contact with all stakeholders, including industry associations in the field of business tourism. Therefore, the Commission would like to reassure the Honourable Member that it has never had the intention to make a proposal to cut business travel by 20 % or by any other percentage.
