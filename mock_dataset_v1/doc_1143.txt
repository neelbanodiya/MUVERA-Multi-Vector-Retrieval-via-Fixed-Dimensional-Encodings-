WRITTEN QUESTION E-3884/09 by Paul Rübig (PPE) to the Commission (5 August 2009) Subject: VAT reimbursement in Romania The Austrian company Delta Projektconsult GmbH, in partnership with an Austrian investor, put approximately EUR 50 million into a project in Craiova, Romania, and duly paid the VAT chargeable on its investment in that country. An application for reimbursement of the VAT was made in Romania last autumn. Although the statutory reimbursement deadline has already passed, despite repeated requests, the Austrian company has had no response from the Romanian authorities. It has become clear, from conversations with representatives of other companies, that this is not an isolated case and, in fact, the Romanian authorities are guilty of systematic foot-dragging on VAT reimbursement. What steps will the Commission take to ensure that Romania reimburses VAT more speedily?
