12th ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly opens with focus on EPAs and East Africa Development and cooperation 2006-11-21 - 09:41 The twelfth session of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which brings together MEPs and parliamentarians from 78 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, started its work on Monday 20 November in Barbados. Economic Partnership Agreements and the situation in East Africa were among the issues raised in the opening speeches. Dame Billie A Miller, Senior Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados, welcomed delegates to the 12th Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA), expressing her appreciation to the European Union for its recognition of the need for custom-designed solutions in its articulation of various strategies for Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (ACP).

He also raised "political instability and conflicts, which are, according to the World Food Organisation (FAO) of the UN the primary cause of hunger," and from which East Africa, in particular suffers. Owen S. Arthur, Prime Minister and Minister of Finance of Barbados, who officially opened the Assembly, said, "Half the world is represented here and the other half is listening." He reminded delegates that the Parliament of Barbados was
