Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (29 November 2011) In its communication COM(2008) 666. on ‘Safe, innovative and accessible medicines: a renewed vision for the pharmaceutical sector’ the Commission recognised that the pollution of the environment with pharmaceutical residues is an emerging environmental problem. The new pharmacovigilance legislation Recital 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1235/2010 and Recital 6 of Directive 2010/84/EU. calls upon the Commission, based, inter alia , on data received from the European Medicines Agency, the European Environment Agency and Member States, to produce a report on the scale of the problem, along with an assessment of whether amendments to Union legislation on medicinal products or other relevant Union legislation are required. A study to underpin the report will be performed in 2011/2012 and the information in the Oekom report, mentioned by the Honourable Member, will be among the evidence considered. Applications for marketing authorisations require the submission of an evaluation of the potential environmental risks posed by the medicinal product Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. , and whilst the EU pharmaceutical legislation addresses the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products per se, the study will inter alia evaluate the current legislation as regards its effectiveness at protecting the environment and human health via the environment. The Commission would also refer the Honourable Member to its answers to Written Questions E‑8359/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E‑2011-008359+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN and E‑4499/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+WQ+E‑2011-004499+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN .
