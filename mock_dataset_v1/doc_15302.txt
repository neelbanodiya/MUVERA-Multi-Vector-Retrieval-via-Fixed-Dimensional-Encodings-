Question for written answer E-008427/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (21 September 2011) Subject: Delays affecting utilisation of Entrepreneurship Fund appropriations According to our information, calls for manifestations of interest from investors in ‘Entrepreneurship Fund’ operations amounting to EUR 460 million have not met with a single response. The necessary funding for this undertaking is provided by the National Fund for Entrepreneurship and Development (ETEAN A.E.), which in turn receives assistance from Greece and Europe (European Regional Development Fund). In view of this: 1. What are the objectives of the Entrepreneurship Fund? What are the reasons for the lack of response to calls for manifestations of interest therein? Why was no interest shown by Greek banks? 2. What measures will it take to ensure that the funds are effectively utilised in order to contribute to economic recovery in Greece?
