Question for written answer E-012301/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Åsa Westlund (S&D) (4 January 2012) Subject: Triclosan and triclocarban in clothing and household products Silver and other anti-bacterial substances such as triclosan and triclocarban are becoming increasingly common in clothing and other household products. These substances are released from garments when they are washed and then spread uncontrolled throughout our environment. The spread of these substances entails major risks to the environment and human health. At the same time, the benefit of their use in clothing and other products is small, particularly compared with the risks to human health and the environment (see for example http://www.kemi.se/sv/Innehall/Nyheter/Luktfria-klader-kan-hota-halsa-och-miljo/ ). It is high time that the Commission acted to prevent this trend continuing. What measures does the Commission propose to take to prevent the further spread of these substances? Has the Commission considered banning these substances in clothing?
