They must also make publicly accessible the assessment report, together with the reasons for their opinion, after deletion of any information of a commercially confidential nature. In the case of medicines authorised by the Commission, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) also publishes the conditions or restrictions placed on the supply or use of the products as well as the accompanying labels and leaflets http://www.emea.europa.eu/htms/human/epar/a.htm . Declarations of interests of all Members of the Management Board, members of the committees, rapporteurs and experts of the EMEA are equally available to the public, on request. Finally, additional provisions reinforcing transparency and safety monitoring are currently being explored in the context of proposals foreseen in the Commission legislative and work programme. In particular, a recent public consultation on the review of the EU pharmacovigilance system http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/pharmaceuticals/pharmacovigilance_acs/index.htm included the proposal to reinforce reporting obligations regarding the results of clinical trials for authorised products including when used outside the terms of the marketing authorisation.
