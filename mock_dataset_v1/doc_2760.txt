EMPL Monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans The EMPL Committee held a first exchange of views on the draft opinion by Tamás Deutsch (PPE - HU) to the legislative report of the ECON Committee on Common provisions for monitoring and assessing draft budgetary plans and ensuring the correction of excessive deficit of the Member States in the euro area. This regulation sets out additional monitoring requirements for national budgetary policies, proposes a common budgetary timeline and calls for closer monitoring of budgetary decisions of Member States subject to an excessive deficit procedure. The EMPL draft opinion stresses in particular that the enforcement of budgetary surveillance should always be subject to overarching objectives of the EU. Thus, in all budgetary assessments in the framework of the excessive deficit procedure, the Council and the Commission are called upon to give due attention to the implementation of social security systems conducive to the Union's sustainable growth objectives. Furthermore, Member States' draft budgetary plans shall be consistent with the broad guidelines for economic policies and the guidelines for employment policies. The discussion focused on strengthening the role of the European Parliament as well as the level of Member States' sovereignty as regards the adoption of national budgets, alignment with the EU2020 strategy goals and the importance of protecting the social state. The draft opinion should be adopted in Committee on 26/27 March 2012. Tamas Deutsch © European Union, EP 20120214CAN38089 Draft opinion
