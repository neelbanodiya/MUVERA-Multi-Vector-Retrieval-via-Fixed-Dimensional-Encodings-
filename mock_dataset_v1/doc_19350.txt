WRITTEN QUESTION E-1810/06 by Nikolaos Vakalis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (28 April 2006) Subject: CO2 emissions from cars The Commission communication entitled ‘Implementing the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from cars: Fifth annual communication on the effectiveness of the strategy’ (COM(2005)269) comes to the conclusion that the rate of reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger cars achieved in the years 2002‑03 has declined by comparison with the years from 1995 to 2001. If this rate of reduction remains at the 2002‑03 levels, it appears unlikely that the objective of average CO2 emissions of 140 g/km set in a voluntary agreement between the Commission and the European, Japanese and Korean car industries (EAMA, JAMA and KAMA) will be met. On the basis of the data contained in the communication, can the Commission say: 1. What additional measures it will take in order to ensure that the objective of average CO2 emissions of 140 g/km can be achieved, in the event that the report for 2004, which is to be published shortly, confirms the above trend? 2. Whether it is necessary to revise the second objective of the Council and Parliament (120 g/km of CO2 by 2012), which the ACEA and JAMA consider technically possible, albeit at a prohibitive cost, or whether additional measures should be taken? 3. Whether there are any data, and if so what data are available, on the impact on average emission figures for cars circulating in the European Union of cars built by manufacturers which are not party to the above voluntary commitment, such as American and Chinese cars?
