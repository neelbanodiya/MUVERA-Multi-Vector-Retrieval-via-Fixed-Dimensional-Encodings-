WRITTEN QUESTION E-4859/09 by Sylvie Guillaume (S-D) and Vincent Peillon (S-D) to the Commission (13 October 2009) Subject: Dealing with the presence of wolves and the future of livestock farming in mountain areas The sheep farming sector is in crisis throughout Europe: both production and consumption have been steadily decreasing for 25 years. The difficulties presented by this economic situation are particularly acute in mountain areas, where sheep farmers are facing an ever increasing number of wolf attacks on their flocks. In fact, this is leading many of them to abandon alpine areas. And yet these farmers play an essential role in the conservation of natural landscapes, in bringing benefits to the economy, in promoting sustainability and in countryside management. Their exodus threatens to cause serious problems such as wildfires, as undergrowth is not naturally controlled, or avalanches. Should this trend not be checked in order to allow farmers and wolves to coexist in these areas? Are there any proposals which aim to revise the Berne Convention of 1979 on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats in order to take into account the increasing presence of wolves in certain conservation areas, which jeopardises all human activity? Finally, what action is planned within the reform of the CAP in order to give genuine support to extensive livestock farming and sustainable practices?
