Question for written answer E-9926/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (26 November 2010) Subject: Privacy issues in respect of Facebook Facebook has become a worldwide communication phenomenon that has opened up advertising opportunities for companies worldwide. While the benefits are clear for advertisers, there is potential for Facebook users to be harmed. According to a recent International Herald Tribune article, advertisers ‘may be able to learn sensitive profile information, such as a person’s sexual orientation or religion, even if the person is sharing that information only with a small circle of friends’. Once people click on an advertisement, they often do not realise that the advertiser now potentially has access to their personal information. Facebook denies that advertisers can obtain this information. Regardless of the accuracy of these allegations, they do present several potential ‘privacy land mines’. Firstly, should there be collaborative, worldwide regulations prohibiting advertisers from obtaining personal information via Facebook? If so, how does the Commission propose to enact such legislation at a global level? Secondly, if advertisers do obtain personal information, what steps will be taken to ensure that no further information is acquired by that company or by other companies? In other words, how will the Commission reprimand those companies that usurp Facebook’s personal information?
