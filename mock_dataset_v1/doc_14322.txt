Joint answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-7157/10 , E-7178/10 , E-7160/10 , E-7177/10 , E-7171/10 , E-7163/10 , E-7173/10 , E-7167/10 , E-7175/10 , E-7159/10 , E-7161/10 , E-7180/10 , E-7182/10 , E-7181/10 , E-7176/10 , E-7172/10 , E-7166/10 , E-7170/10 , E-7168/10 , E-7164/10 , E-7174/10 , E-7183/10 , E-7165/10 , E-7179/10 , E-7162/10 , E-7158/10 , E-7169/10 (27 October 2010) The Commission (Eurostat) does not collect statistics on company bankruptcies and is not able to provide statistics on the bankruptcies of microenterprises, their reasons (globalisation or structural reasons) and their impact on the European employment market and GDP. However, Regulation (EC) No 295/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2008 concerning structural business statistics (recast) OJ L 97, 9.4.2008. provides for a detailed module for the collection of statistics on business demography. It requires Member States to produce statistics on enterprise births, deaths and survival rates broken down by size classes of employment of enterprises using common definitions and methodology. In this context, an enterprise death is defined as an enterprise that was previously active but has not been present among the active enterprises for at least two years (after checking for any reactivations). The Commission can provide data on the number of deaths of enterprises with less than 10 employees, including the related impact on employment, irrespective of the specific reasons for their death, which may include bankruptcies but also a number of other reasons.

Finally, the Commission cannot undertake, for the purpose of answering a written question, the further lengthy and costly research that would be required to provide the Honourable Member with any other information requested. Beyond the fact that the crisis has indeed multiplied the number of bankruptcies and hence made this a prominent issue, the Commission has always had an interest in supporting honest bankrupt entrepreneurs gain a second chance. This has been the issue of Commission reports, activities, a communication (2007) culminating in the Small Business Act (SBA) COM(2008)394 final. where the totality of principle II is devoted to the subject. In order to promote the implementation of the SBA the Commission is currently promoting and hosting a dialogue between all Member States to
