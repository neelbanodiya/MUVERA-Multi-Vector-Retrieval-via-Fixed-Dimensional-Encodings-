Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (19 September 2006) The information provided in the written question does not indicate, in the Commission's opinion, the existence of an infringement to EU public procurement rules. The service procured by the contracting authority in this particular tender includes, besides the creation of digital learning objects and of an Internet platform to control access and availability, the acquisition of the intellectual property rights related to them. Hence, the tender requirement concerning the transfer of such rights to the contracting authority does not seem to qualify as a discriminatory one. On the possible breach of the principle of competition, the Commission notes that this principle is stated in the provisions of the directives 2004/17/EC Directive 2004/17/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. and 2004/18/EC Directive 2004/18/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. which include, amongst others, specific rules on advertising and transparency in order to open up public contracts to competition. On this issue, the Commission observes that a contract notice regarding the above contract was published in the EU's Official Journal OJ S 44, 46657-2006. .
