claim provided as collateral. Member States may, however, maintain the performance of a formal act, such as registration or notification, for purposes of perfection, priority, enforceability or admissibility in evidence against the debtor or third parties. ” Justification The exception to the rule in the first sentence of subparagraph 2 recognises that credit claims are different to other forms of financial collateral. There are circumstances where the enforceability of a credit claim against a debtor is subject to formal requirements (for example, for the protection of a debtor). The need for these provisions does not change because the credit claim is used as collateral. Though Member States should not be able to impose requirements on the provision of a credit claim as financial collateral (save as provided in the directive), their ability to require formalities in relation for the purposes of perfection, priority, or enforceability needs to be retained, and should not be removed after a transitional period.
