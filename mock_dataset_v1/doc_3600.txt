to the Constitution of Ukraine and the efforts of the opposition in this respect, while stating its belief that the legitimacy of constitutional change should be derived from genuine public support for its aims. MEPs encourage Ukraine to respond positively to the offer by the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) of further cooperation in the field of constitutional reforms. MEPs are urging the Council and Commission to monitor closely the situation in Ukraine, to take an active part in the run-up to next autumn’s presidential elections and to support a joint action with the OSCE/ODHIR and the Council of Europe. Finally, they call on the Ukrainian authorities to make a formal commitment to hold October’s forthcoming presidential elections in conditions of the greatest possible transparency.

It makes an appeal for calm and moderation, recognising the right of citizens to demonstrate peacefully within the limits of constitutional legality and calls on the authorities to persevere with their endeavours to restore order in a context of respect for human rights and the rule of law. MEPs call on the National Electoral Council to accept and adopt forthwith the recommendations of the Organisation of American States (OAS) observation mission and the Carter Centre in relation to the preliminary report on the signature verification process. They reiterate their support for the joint positions reached by the Government and the Democratic Coordination in the agreements of 29 May 2003, which offered a peaceful, dialogue-based, democratic, constitutional and electoral solution to the crisis, and stress that those agreements remain entirely valid. Parliament expresses its concern at the fact that as things stand these agreements are being ignored, as is the solution advanced at the negotiating table by the Group of Friendly Nations and the International Tripartite Commission. MEPs urge the Commission to act in coordination with the OAS observation mission and the Carter Centre observers, to ensure that the agreements are properly implemented and
