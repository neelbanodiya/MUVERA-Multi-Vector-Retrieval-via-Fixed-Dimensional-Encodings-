Reply (29 September 2003) The Council conclusions on election assistance and observation of 26 June 2001 (9990/01) emphasised its commitment to contributing to peace and security and to promoting a stable and democratic political environment as outlined in Article 1 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement. These conclusions are consistent with the political dialogue provided for by the Cotonou Agreement, in particular in Article 8(3) thereof. Decisions to send EU electoral observation missions are based on an assessment of the political situation of the country and the potential effect of EU electoral observation and the availability of resources as well as the relative priority of each mission to be undertaken. At the moment, Council bodies are examining the priorities for election observation in the second half of 2003 and 2004. The Commission is in charge of the organisation and implementation, including financial resources, of electoral observation missions. In this context, the Commission submits its priorities to the Council and Parliament for political approval. With a view to nominating joint delegations for election observation missions, the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly may refer to appropriate bodies though itself remaining the competent body to decide on the sending of such joint delegations. The Council was not aware of any Member States having invited ACP delegations to observe elections in the EU.
