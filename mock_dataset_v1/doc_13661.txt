WRITTEN QUESTION E-5827/08 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (28 October 2008) Subject: Maximum sound levels for personal music systems Under current legislation, sound levels for personal music systems (MP3, iPOD etc.) requiring the use of headphones must not exceed 100 decibels. However, recent research has revealed that sound levels in modern devices fluctuate between 80 and 120 decibels, a level considered harmful to the health of those concerned, particularly young users. Does the Commission agree that it is necessary to review existing legislation so as to encompass modern devices in which specified maximum sound levels are likely to be exceeded? Given that almost 100 million people in Europe use such devices to listen to music, does the Commission intend to draw the attention of the public to the harmful effects of high noise levels and how does it intend to do so?
