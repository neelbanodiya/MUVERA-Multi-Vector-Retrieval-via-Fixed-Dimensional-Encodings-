of access to the courts, the right to a public hearing, the principle of adversarial proceedings, the right to proceedings within a reasonable time, the right to an impartial and independent tribunal, the right to a defence, the presumption of innocence and the right not to be tried or punished twice in criminal proceedings for the same offence. The Council was called upon to adopt a framework decision on common standards for procedural law. With regard to social rights, Parliament expressed great concern at the significant number of violations of social rights in the Member States and noted that the Committee of Ministers of the European Social Charter had established 56 cases of violations in the fields of child labour, maternity protection and access of foreigners to the labour market. In the field of terrorism, although Parliament reiterated its unconditional rejection and condemnation of it, MEPs are concerned at the negative impact on human rights as a result of measures taken to combat terrorism. Parliament asked Member States to introduce a sunset provision in their specific anti-terrorism legislation. MEPs also urged Member States to adopt a common asylum policy as well as an ambitious programme for the integration of third country citizens, to regularise the status of people without identity papers who have significant ties to the host country, to increase flexibility in procedures for nationalisation or dual nationality, to step up measures to combat illegal immigration, to limit the detention of asylum seekers to exceptional cases and a limited period, and to adhere to the principle of non-refoulement (i.e. not to turn applicants away before proper procedures have been completed). Parliament urged the Member States to refrain from any initiative that aims at changing the Geneva Convention itself. However, Parliament called for the criteria governing the admission of refugees to the EU to be broadened to include, in particular, persecution inflicted by persons other than representatives of the state and persecution based on sex (including the threat and the risk to women of being subjected to genital mutilation) and on sexual orientation (18). With regard to EU citizenship, all Member States were called upon to apply the European Convention on the participation of foreigners in public life at local level and to extend the right to vote and stand as a candidate in local and European elections to all third country citizens who have lived legally in the EU
