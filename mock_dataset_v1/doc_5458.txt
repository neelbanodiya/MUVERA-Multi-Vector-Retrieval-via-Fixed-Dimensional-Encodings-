WRITTEN QUESTION E-3471/04 by Michl Ebner (PPE-DE) to the Commission (20 December 2004) Subject: European voluntary service At the meeting of the Education, Youth and Culture Council held on Monday, 15 November 2004, the subject of young people was discussed in relation to the ‘Youth in Action’ programme for 2007‑2013. The Netherlands State Secretary rightly emphasised that more attention should be paid to voluntary services undertaken by young people. A Europe‑wide voluntary service in the area of disaster protection, first aid, social action and ecological services would certainly provide an important and appropriate form of assistance. It would create a diverse pool of human resources that could be called upon in an emergency to provide help efficiently. A compulsory voluntary service of three to six months for young people of both genders could be introduced at European level. Can the Commission give its opinion on this proposal?
