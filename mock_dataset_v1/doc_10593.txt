and data available will also be analysed under the new public health programme by gender to establish comparable information across the EU. At the moment the Commission has included in the current public health programme a priority item in the 2006 work plan for the preparation of a report on women’s health, to develop specific gender health indicators and to give particular attention to improvinh relevant information for specifically women’s gynaecological and menopausal health. The Commission considers that a report on women’s health is necessary as an important element in the preparation of a policy approach on gender health, and is complementary to the Commission’s ongoing efforts to take into account gender health concerns and, in particular, concerns about women’s health, in the development of public health policy initiatives. The health theme of the framework research programme 2007‑13 (FP7) states that gender aspects will be integrated into research, taking into account women’s and men’s different risk factors, biological mechanisms, causes, clinical manifestation, consequences and treatment of disease. Furthermore, gender equality is one of the overarching objectives of the new streamlined open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion and social protection, bringing together the fields of social inclusion, pensions, health and long-term care. These common objectives, and the specific objectives relating to each of the three strands, are available at the following website: http://europa.eu.int/comm/employment_social/social_inclusion/objectives_en.htm. In addition, in the context of the follow-up to the Beijing platform for action, the Commission, together with the Austrian Presidency, is currently working on the development of indicators in the field of women and health.
