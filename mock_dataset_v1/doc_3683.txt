WRITTEN QUESTION E-1065/05 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (21 March 2005) Subject: Infringement of Directive 76/207/EEC on equal treatment of women as regards employment Greek Law No. 3013/02 - introducing the notion of quotas - provides that ‘the proportion of women recruited to municipal police forces shall be 15% of the total number to be recruited’. However, the related interpretative circulars issued by the Greek authorities construe the 15% as the maximum percentage of women among recruits as a whole. Even where successful female applicants are in the majority, as was recently the case in Thessaloniki, the number of women recruited is strictly limited to 15%. Article 3(1) of Directive 76/207/EEC OJ L 39, 14.2.1976, p. 40 states that application of the principle of equal treatment means that there shall be no discrimination whatsoever on grounds of sex in the conditions for access to all jobs or posts. Moreover, Directive 2000/78/EC OJ L 303, 2.12.2000, p. 16 states in point 18 that, provided the conditions governing professional competence are met, there cannot be discrimination on grounds of sex in recruitment to police forces. Furthermore, in case C-203/03, the Court of Justice of the European Communities ruled (1 February 2005) against Austria for its failure to fulfil its obligations pursuant to Articles 2 and 3 of Directive 76/207/EEC on equal treatment of men and women as regards access to employment. Can the Commission say whether Law No. 3013/02 constitutes discrimination against women in the light of the recent interpretation of the Court of Justice? If so, what measures will it take to ensure that the Greek authorities comply with Community law and abolish this discrimination against women?
