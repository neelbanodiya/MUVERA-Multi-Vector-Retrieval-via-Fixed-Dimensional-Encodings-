are being ignored, as is the solution advanced at the negotiating table by the Group of Friendly Nations and the International Tripartite Commission. MEPs urge the Commission to act in coordination with the OAS observation mission and the Carter Centre observers, to ensure that the agreements are properly implemented and that the procedures are fully transparent.

The House insists that the SPDC relinquish its grip on power and the results of the last elections to be fully respected. The House also insists that the recommendations of the UN Special Rapporteur's report be implemented and MEPs reaffirm their strong commitment to full support for democratic, judicial and political change in Burma. MEPs want the EU's common position on Burma to be strengthened to prevent EU companies and citizens from investing in Burma; to ban the import of goods and services from enterprises owned by the military and their associates and to ban the import of strategically imported goods such as gems and timber. The House urges all Member States to immediately and fully implement sanctions adopted. MEPs call on the UN to impose targeted sanctions on Burma, and on the UN Security Council to address the situation in Burma as a matter of urgency. Finally MEPs regret that the Government of the Republic of Ireland decided to establish diplomatic relations on a non-resident basis with Burma on 10 February almost at the start of its tenure of the Council Presidency.
