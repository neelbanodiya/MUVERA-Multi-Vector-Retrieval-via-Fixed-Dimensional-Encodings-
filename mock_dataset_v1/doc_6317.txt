been set up dealing with the Structural Funds and these constitute a substantial source of information regarding the implementation of Structural Fund measures on the ground, specifically: http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/country/commu/beneficiaries/index_en.htm http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/esf/discover/article_7093_en.htm. However, the selection of projects co-financed under the European Social Fund (ESF) and under the ERDF is, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of the Member State or the relevant regional managing authority under the conditions laid down in the operational programmes concerned. For further information, the Honourable Member should contact the authorities responsible for managing the Human Potential Operational Programme for the ESF and/or the Operational Programme for Northern Portugal for the ERDF. Furthermore, should workers be made redundant, the Member State may be able to apply for a contribution from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to co-finance active labour market measures designed to reintegrate them into employment. The criteria for granting such a contribution include a minimum number of redundancies (500) within a four-month period, caused either by major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation or by the global economic crisis.
