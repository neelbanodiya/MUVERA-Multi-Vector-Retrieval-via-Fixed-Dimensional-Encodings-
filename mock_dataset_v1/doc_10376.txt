ORAL QUESTION H-0318/05 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Valdis Dombrovskis to the Commission Subject: 4% of national GNI capping rule There is a Commission proposal to impose the 4% of national GNI capping rule on the new Member States as an upper limit for the Union's financial assistance during the next financial perspective. Given that a country or a region is eligible for assistance from the Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund, this proposal effectively means less assistance to the poorer regions and countries, compared with the similar but more prosperous regions and countries. This is inconsistent with the goals of the regional policy to reduce regional disparities. During the hearing at the European Parliament, Budget Commissioner Ms Dalia Grybauskaite noted: 'The 4% figure is not a dogma, and it must be possible to discuss it openly and with a certain degree of flexibility'. What action is the Commission taking to change the 4% rule into a more flexible solution which would be in line with the aim of regional policy to ensure appropriate focus on less prosperous territories?
