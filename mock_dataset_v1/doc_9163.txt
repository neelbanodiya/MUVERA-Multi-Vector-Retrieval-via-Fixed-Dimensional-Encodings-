Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (27 January 2005) The Commission is indeed aware of the ongoing court case against Egitim Sen. According to its information, this union is accused of breaching Turkey’s constitution because an article in its statute supports the right to be educated in one’s own mother tongue (the Constitution states that education should be provided in the official language, meaning Turkish). The Attorney General prosecuted Egitim Sen in 1998 and 2002 and on both occasions the Court decided in favour of the union. Despite this, in the summer of 2004 Egitim Sen was again prosecuted on these grounds. Once again the Court ruled in favour of the union on 15 September 2004. However, as the Honourable Member states, this ruling was rejected by the Supreme Court in November 2004 and a retrial began before the Labour Court on 10 December 2004. At this first hearing, the defence argued that the initial decision of the Labour Court should prevail. The case was adjourned to 21 February 2005. The Commission’s general assessment on Trade Union rights in Turkey is given in its Regular Report 2004 SEC (2004) 1201 . It is noted in particular that ‘significant constraints remain on the right to organise and the right to collective bargaining, including the right to strike, and Turkey still falls short of International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards.’ In the context of its ongoing monitoring of the situation vis-à-vis Trade Union rights in Turkey, the Commission will continue to closely follow the case against Egitim Sen.
