9999/C Q999 E/003 WRITTEN QUESTION P-0956/04 by Brian Crowley (UEN) to the Commission (18 March 2004) Subject: Decoupling, farm retirement and families Will the Commission confirm that it has received an appeal from the West Cork group of retired farmers regarding the damaging consequences of decoupling on the return of leased land, and does it realise that the rights of these farmers - who entered the early retirement scheme in good faith - to hand over this land to their sons and daughters as their rightful inheritance to develop to its full potential has been seriously affected? What action does it intend to take to ensure that their sons and daughters can inherit farms which are capable of providing a proper livelihood?
