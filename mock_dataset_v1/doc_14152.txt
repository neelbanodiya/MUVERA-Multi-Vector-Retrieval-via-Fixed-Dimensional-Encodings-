to reach a target level, and the disclosure of fees associated with asset management of any layer of pension funds; 52. Notes that, in many Member States, there is huge choice in the second and third pillars; emphasises that pension choice is very complex for employees and private individuals; is of the opinion that default options should be available and that adequate information must be available concerning the differences between the default option and the alternatives; 53. Takes the view that workers should be provided with information about the costs, fees and risks linked to the conclusion of contracts for additional pension provision; POLICY COORDINATION 54. Recalls that Commission President Barroso made pensions a priority in his first term of office; is of the opinion that a coherent and comprehensive approach is needed; welcomes the Green Paper as a first step towards such an approach; looks forward to concrete legislative proposals in the near future; points out that any concrete legislative proposal needs to take due account of the principle of subsidiarity; 55. Calls on the Commission to consider setting up a special task force on pensions, involving all relevant DGs with competences relating to pensions issues; 56. Considers that establishing a European pension platform covering all pension pillars and open to all stakeholders could be useful; considers that, in order to avoid overlap in this context, account should be taken of the existing advisory committee on supplementary pensions (the ‘Pensions Forum’); 57. Stresses the importance of the OMC for policy coordination; encourages Member States to step up cooperation with one another and at European level; 58. Believes the European institutions should lead by example in setting adequate and sustainable pensions; notes that the last full review of the European institutions’ pension provision was in 2004 and therefore requests the Commission to undertake a detailed review of current procedures and provision and to submit a detailed report to Parliament by June 2011.
