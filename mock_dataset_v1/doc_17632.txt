as currently proposed; rejects the idea of bringing the gender equality programme under the PROGRESS umbrella and the integration of the specific programme "Fight against violence (Daphne) and drugs prevention and information" into the general programme "Fundamental rights and justice" ( COM(2005)0122 ), and urges the Commission to modify its proposal to allow Daphne to remain a stand-alone programme; is of the opinion that to include the more specific programmes as part of broader programmes risks marginalising both the impact and the visibility of the gender equality and women's rights policies; meanwhile requests that the budget allocated for the implementation of specific programmes and directives not be decreased; Specific areas 9.
