Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (29 January 2009) The situation of Montagnards in Vietnam as well as freedom of religion has been raised regularly within the EU Troika-Vietnam human rights dialogue. The Commission does not have any recent information on the individual situation of Mr Ksor Krok but it has, however, proposed that the issue be discussed by Member States' embassies in Hanoi and, if appropriate, raised with Vietnamese authorities. The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) has been monitoring closely the situation of repatriated asylum-seekers in Vietnam. As part of the Strategic Dialogue project with Vietnam the Commission concluded a contribution agreement with UNHCR in 2008 specifically to support its work in the central highlands. EU Ambassadors posted in Hanoi also carried out a field visit to the central highlands in November 2008. The Commission does not believe that an international observer mission would bring added value to the monitoring work of the UN and to regular visits by representatives of Member States.
