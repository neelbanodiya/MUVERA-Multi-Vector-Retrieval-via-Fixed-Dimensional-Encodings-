2004/C 70 E/269 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3271/03 by Marianne Thyssen (PPE-DE) to the Commission (5 November 2003) Subject: The carcinogenic substance bisphenol A in babies' plastic feeding bottles On 26 September 2003 an international conference was held in Antwerp, Belgium, on the subject of fertility. The American scientist and hormone specialist Frederick vom Saal reported, inter alia, on the results of his research into the health effects of bisphenol A, a chemical which is used, among other things, in the manufacture of plastic babies' bottles. The research indicated that bisphenol A is more dangerous than was at first thought. It is believed that in the long term the substance may be implicated in a number of health problems: prostate cancer, fertility problems in men, and mental conditions such as Parkinson's disease and ADHD. Breast cancer and premature puberty in girls are also thought to be possible effects of ingesting this substance, inter alia via babies' feeding bottles. Is the Commission aware of the possible dangers of bisphenol A? If scientific research confirms that the substance is indeed dangerous, does the Commission not consider that it would be an urgent necessity to prohibit its use by manufacturers in the making of their product? Does the Commission not take the view that, failing this, it should make information available to the general public?
