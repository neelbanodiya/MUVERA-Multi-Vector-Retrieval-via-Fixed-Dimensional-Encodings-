Question for written answer E-001852/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Marina Yannakoudakis (ECR) (15 February 2012) Subject: Technical Assistance Information Exchange Office (TAIEX) missions and substantial financial assistance to Turkish-occupied Cyprus One of the main objectives of the substantial financial assistance provided by the Commission to Turkish-occupied Cyprus is to ‘help the Turkish Cypriot community to be ready to implement EU rules ( acquis communautaire ) in case of a comprehensive settlement’. Given that the Commission is spending millions of euros on TAIEX missions to the northern part of Cyprus, the main objective of which is to provide assistance in the preparation of legal texts aligned with the acquis communautaire , would the Commission consider an urgent TAIEX mission to Cyprus to assist the authorities in the north with amending Chapter 154 of the Criminal Code? The amendments in question would repeal the north’s ban on homosexuality, which is both outdated and outrageous. I have entreated Turkish Cypriot leader Dr Eroğlu to repeal the north’s gay ban on a number of occasions. He has promised to do so, but the ban remains on the statute books, and arrests continue to take place. I am certain that a TAIEX mission would help speed up the process of amendment. I understand that TAIEX missions are usually ‘demand-driven’ on the part of the recipient partner, but I believe in this case that the Commission should intervene to make this a priority ahead of all other TAIEX missions.
