WRITTEN QUESTION E-0259/08 by Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (28 January 2008) Subject: Implementation of Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 Will the Commission provide an updated report on implementation of Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 OJ L 292, 15.11.1996, p. 2. since its entry into force, including the number of checks carried out in each Member State and the sectors in which such checks were carried out? — Will the Commission state whether the regulation has been applied uniformly in all Member States? — In the practical implementation of the regulation, what Member States have cooperated with OLAF and agreed to the checks being carried out? — What Member States have delayed such checks? — Have irregularities been reported that would justify initiating infringement proceedings against certain Member States? — Should no such proceedings have been initiated, will the Commission indicate whether OLAF has at any point stated that it would be appropriate to do so?
