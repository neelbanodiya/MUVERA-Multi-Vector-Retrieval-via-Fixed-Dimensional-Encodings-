2004/C 78 E/327 WRITTEN QUESTION E-3774/03 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (11 December 2003) Subject: Update on the use of funds from the Leonardo programme for the Terni municipality In response to my previous question ( E-1074/03 OJ C 268 E, 7.11.2003, p. 151 . ) asking whether the Terni municipality had submitted projects and obtained funding under the Leonardo programme, the Commission stated on 8 May 2003 that Terni had not applied for such funding. Will the Commission state, again in respect of centrally managed funds, whether any projects were submitted subsequently and, if so, what decision has been taken on them?
