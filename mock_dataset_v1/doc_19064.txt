WRITTEN QUESTION E-2319/04 by Konstantinos Hatzidakis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (5 October 2004) Subject: Fight against cybercrime in the EU Greece has recently seen a wave of cybercrime. Reports that networks of hackers have succeeded by various means in intercepting bank account codes belonging to people who use the e-banking system are particularly serious. Given the cross-border nature of the internet, the fight against high-tech crime can only be effective at European level. In its communication on this subject the Commission had announced its intention to promote the creation at national level of police units specialised in fighting IT crime, support technical training measures geared to the implementation of the law and foster European initiatives for transnational cooperation in the field of IT security. Similarly, the 1999 Tampere European Council had set the introduction of common definitions and sanctions in the field of high-tech crime as one of its priorities. 1. Does the Commission believe that the current legislative framework for combating cybercrime is adequate? 2. What initiatives will it take to tackle the problem?
