Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (16 August 2011) The First Smart Mobility Challenge on European multimodal journey planner, launched by Vice-President Kallas on 6 June during the European ITS Conference in Lyon, aims at promoting the development of Europe-wide multimodal journey planners by stimulating not only industry, but also all stakeholders involved in travel management to present their practical solutions or innovative ideas in this area. While the technology for setting up and operating a truly European multimodal journey planner already exists, other barriers still remain and they can be described as follows: — Not all travel data is widely available. — Data available today is in different formats, which makes it more difficult to exchange information. — Accuracy and completeness of travel information vary from country to country. — There is too little collaboration between different regions and countries. Building on the results of several research projects funded by the Commission under the research programmes FP6 and FP7 (e.g. eMotion, WiseTrip, EU‑Spirit, i-Travel), the Commission is addressing those specific barriers in an ongoing study in the framework of the implementation of the ITS Action Plan. This work should also lead to the definition and adoption by the end of 2014 of specifications for EU‑wide multimodal travel information services, which constitutes priority action (a) of Directive 2010/40/EU. In this context, it is not the intention of the Commission, with the Smart Mobility Challenge, to set up and operate such European multimodal journey planner, nor to provide specific funds for the development and market deployment of such tool. This initiative should rather be seen as a way of encouraging organisations and companies to contribute directly to removing some of the identified obstacles to integrated travel planning and integrated ticketing in Europe.
