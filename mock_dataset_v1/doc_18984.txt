Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (12 December 2005) The deadline for transposing Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community OJ L 80, 23.3.2002 . was 23 March 2005. Non-notification of national implementing measures constitutes a failure on the part of a Member State to meet its obligations, as a result of which the Commission institutes infringement proceedings, commencing with a pre-litigation phase in which the Member State concerned is sent a letter of formal notice. Ireland was sent such a letter on 31 May 2005. The Commission examines the conformity of national implementing measures once they have been adopted and notified, but it does not rule on the conformity of bills.
