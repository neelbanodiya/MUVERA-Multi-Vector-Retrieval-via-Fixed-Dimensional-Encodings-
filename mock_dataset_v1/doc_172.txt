Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (23 July 2008) Defibrillators have become a widespread standard among the European airline industry, on long haul carriers especially. The Commission confirms the life-saving potential of defibrillators and their useful contribution to passengers' health, hence fully supports the propagation of the carriage of this equipment. Today there are no provisions making the carriage of defibrillators compulsory for commercial air operators under Regulation (EC) No 1899/2006 Regulation (EC) No 1899/2006 of Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation, OJ L 377, 27.12.2006. , so called ‘EU‑OPS’. However, Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC, OJ L 79, 19.3.2008. , adopted by Parliament and the Council in early 2008, establishes new essential requirements for air operations. In this framework, the Commission should be able to take a decision on the carriage of defibrillators in the light of the opinion on operational requirements that the European Aviation Safety Agency is expected to adopt by summer 2009. This opinion will be based on the outcome of a wide public consultation that should be launched in the fourth quarter of 2008 at the latest.
