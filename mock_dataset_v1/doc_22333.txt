the world Parliament also lists its priorities on EU-US international relations, including the fight against global terrorism, the latest Middle East negotiations and the threat of nuclear weapons. Regarding the Israel-Palestinian conflict, MEPs welcome the new US approach to Israel. They say that further talks are needed and should lead "within an agreed time-frame, to a two-state solution with the state of Israel and an independent, democratic and viable State of Palestine". The Israeli government is urged to renew the moratorium on settlement building. A call to "explore less intrusive alternatives" than collection of PNR data Personal data protection has been a difficult area for EU-US relations recently, as in the case of the agreement on banking data transfers (Swift report). A general EU-US data protection agreement is now under discussion, as is a new agreement on the sharing of passenger flight data (PNR). Parliament will have a right of veto on both accords. In a separate resolution on this subject, tabled by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, Greens/EFA, ECR and GUE/NGL groups, Parliament stresses that PNR data should in no circumstances be used for data mining or profiling. MEPs reiterate their call to the Commission to provide factual evidence that the collection, storage and processing of PNR data is necessary" in this respect. They also call on the Commission to "explore less intrusive alternatives". 20101110IPR93910 Adopted text will be available here (click on 11 November) Joint motion for a resolution on the forthcoming EU-US Summit and the Transatlantic Economic Council Watch video of debate in plenary 10 November 2010 EN 1 LINK /activities/plenary/ta/calendar.do?language=EN EN 3 LINK /wps-europarl-internet/frd/vod/player?date=20101110&language=en -//EP//TEXT MOTION P7-RC-2010-0608 0 NOT XML V0//EN -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
