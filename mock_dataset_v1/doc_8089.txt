Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2010) Belarus is not a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Negotiations are ongoing but Belarus still needs to make significant progress to be able to join this organisation. WTO accession is a prerequisite for further development of trade relations. Once this basic criterion fulfilled it could be possible to examine to what extent is Belarus able to negotiate and undertake further bilateral trade commitments. The process of the ratification of the EU‑Belarus Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) has been frozen since 1997 due to a deterioration of the human rights situation in Belarus. As a result, the EU and Belarus continue to apply the 1989 EU‑USSR Trade and Cooperation Agreement which lays down very basic principles of trade. The bilateral agreement on trade in textile and clothing products expired at the end of 2009. Belarus did not want to renew it, indicating that the customs union created with Russia and Kazakhstan prevented them from continuing this agreement. Consequently, as from 1 January 2010, the EU is applying autonomous quantitative restrictions on imports from Belarus in trade in textile and clothing products. The scope and level of the quantitative restrictions are identical to the levels applied in 2009 under the bilateral agreement. Belarus was withdrawn from the list of beneficiaries of the EU Generalised System of Preferences following an investigation which demonstrated that Belarus failed to respect core ILO obligations relating to freedom of association of workers. The trade preferences can be re-established at any time provided that Belarus fully respects those basic rights included in two ILO Conventions No 87 and 98.
