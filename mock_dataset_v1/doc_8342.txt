Corbett explained that his weblog allowed him at least to counter some of the eurosceptic myths published by a largely eurosceptic press in Britain and to get feedback from his voters. The possibility of interacting with readers of weblogs was cautiously seen as an asset, although the same problem of possibly undesirable postings on the net arose. It was for that reason, Corbett said, that he kept control of any reactions he received. As regards privacy, Lillington acknowledged that weblogs after last December's tsunami were a useful source of information and that pictures taken by passers-by after the bomb attacks on the London underground were posted on the Internet quicker than by any established news organisation, but she also stressed that these did somehow damage privacy.
