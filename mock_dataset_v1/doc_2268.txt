9999/C Q999 E/055 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1383/04 by Joke Swiebel (PSE) to the Commission (22 April 2004) Subject: Implementation of EU legislation on equal treatment of men and women Anybody who wonders what the situation is as regards the implementation of European legislation in the field of equal treatment of men and women in the Member States and the future Member States will have great difficulty in finding practically usable and readily accessible overviews. The information in the Commission's annual reports on the implementation of Community law is too general for this purpose and moreover is not cumulative, so that it would be necessary to consult many consecutive annual reports. The information contained in the periodic Bulletin(s) (on) Legal Issues in Equality is very detailed but regrettably makes it difficult to compare the situation in different countries, as well as being very out of date by the time of publication and also non-cumulative. The European Parliament has repeatedly requested the publication of clear information on the state of implementation of the equal treatment acquis in the Member States, the shortcomings therein and the measures taken by the Commission to improve it (EP resolution on the Annual Report on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union 2000, P5_TA(2002)0206 OJ C 131 E, 5.6.2003, p. 158 . of 25 April 2002, Paragraph 8, EP resolution on the implementation of the gender equality programme, P5_TA(2002)0372 OJ C 271 E, 12.11.2003, p. 590 . of 4 July 2002, Paragraph 5, and EP resolution on equal opportunities for women and men in the European Union, P5_TA-PROV(2004)0023 of 14 January 2004, Paragraph 2). - Will the Commission indicate why it has not so far been able or willing to accede to this simple desire for transparency? - Will the Commission now without delay publish in a systematic manner the information requested? - Will the Commission explain its strategy for enforcing legislation on equal treatment and assess the results achieved? - Will the Commission not only give the answer to this question to the tabler of the question but also publish the requested overview on the Commission's website?
