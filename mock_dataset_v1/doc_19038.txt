Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (30 May 2011) The EU is profoundly concerned at reports that large numbers of Christians attempting to celebrate Easter in unregistered churches in China were rounded up by the police. The EU intends to raise again all matters related to freedom of religion at the next round of Human Rights Dialogue with China that will take place in Beijing on 16 June 1011. In the meantime, the EU is committed to continue pressing the Chinese authorities to allow individuals in China to be guaranteed the right to practise their religion without any restrictions.
