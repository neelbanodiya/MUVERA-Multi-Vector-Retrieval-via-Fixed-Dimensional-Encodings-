which specific alternatives should be taken into account. According to Article 6, paragraph 4 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. a project or plan that will adversely affect a special area of conservation can only be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and in the absence of alternative solutions. Should it appear from an appropriate assessment that the construction of the planned motorway will actually have significant negative effects on a site protected under Directive 92/43/EEC, then the existence of a feasible alternative solution would oblige the Netherlands to reconsider the original project. It is for individual Member States to make decisions in relation to the construction of transport infrastructure on their territory while respecting their Community obligations. However, where Natura 2000 sites are adversely affected by a project, this obligation inter alia includes the need to explore alternative solutions. Where such solutions exist, it is the responsibility of the Member State to assess their technical and socioeconomic feasibility.
