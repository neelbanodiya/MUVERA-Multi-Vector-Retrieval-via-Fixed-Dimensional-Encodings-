WRITTEN QUESTION E-1503/07 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (22 March 2007) Subject: EIB loans to Greece Everyone knows that the appropriations made available to Greece under the third Community support framework are not absorbed. The Greek press has reported (e.g. see the edition of the daily paper Eleftherotypia of 26 February 2007) that the Greek Minister for Economic Affairs is moving towards European Investment Bank (EIB) loans for projects under the fourth Community support framework. It is generally recognised that Greece is heavily indebted: its public debt has reached the astronomic sum of EUR 230 billion and every year Greece pays EUR 25 billion in debt repayment alone. The Greek press reports that this is going to increase Greece’s debt burden even further and will be passed on to future governments, something that apparently does not worry the present New Democracy government. Has the Commission suggested loans to carry out projects under the fourth Community support framework (and thus increased the pressure on the Greek public who are already being shamelessly bled). If not, who did propose it? Why is it necessary to borrow when the appropriations under the third Community support framework are lying dormant?
