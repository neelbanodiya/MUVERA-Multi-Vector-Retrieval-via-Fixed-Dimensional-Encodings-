Question for written answer E-007452/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nessa Childers (S&D) (27 July 2011) Subject: Gendered use of antidepressants On 5 July, Platform 21, a platform organisation advocating for the rights of girls and women in England and Wales, published a report entitled ‘Check and choices: women and antidepressants’ which highlights that a large number of women use antidepressants for long periods, without being reviewed or offered any alternatives to drugs. Although this report concerns the UK mental healthcare services, has the Commission any similar research on antidepressants’ consumption from a gender perspective at an EU level? Has the Commission any concerns about the increasing inappropriate use of antidepressants?
