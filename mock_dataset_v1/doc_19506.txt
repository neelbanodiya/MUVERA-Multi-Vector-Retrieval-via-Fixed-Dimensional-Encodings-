Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (17 September 2010) Council Directive 1999/74/EC Council Directive 1999/74/EC laying down minimum standards for the protection of laying hens, OJ L 203, 3.8.1999. on the protection of laying hens entered into force on 3 August 1999 and granted a sufficient transitional period for producers to phase out conventional cages by 1 January 2012. The Commission does not intend to propose an extension of the legal deadline for phasing out conventional cages. The issue was discussed at the Agricultural Council on 22 February 2010 with the result that there is no support for a postponement in the Council. A postponement would only break the positive dynamic created by those Member States who have already managed to ban eggs from conventional cages and would create confusion throughout the entire sector including consumers. Furthermore, it would distort competition and penalise those producers that have already invested in other rearing systems. Regarding the introduction of an additional production code for marketing the eggs from enriched cages in order to distinguish them from eggs produced in conventional cages, this code would serve the same purpose as the existing voluntary indication of ‘enriched cages’ laid down in the egg marketing regulation Commission Regulation (EC) No 589/2008 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards marketing standards for eggs, OJ L 163, 24.6.2008. . The Commission carried out an economic evaluation of the use of the voluntary indication for enriched cages as required by Article 35 of this regulation and concluded that the economic impact of the use of such indication is not significant. As a result, the Commission does not see the added value of the introduction of an additional production code. The Commission is constantly discussing the issue with main stakeholders and Member States authorities. The Commission is planning to meet main stakeholders and Member States authorities in order to assess the state of play on the implementation of the directive. This meeting is scheduled for January 2011.
