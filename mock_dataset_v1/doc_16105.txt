Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (21 February 2008) The annex V, item 5.1.3. of Directive 2005/36/EC Directive 2005/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council on the recognition of professional qualifications, OJ L 255, 30.9.2005. lists all medical specialities (and corresponding national titles) for which the minimum training duration has been harmonised. Holders of such national titles can then benefit from automatic recognition in another Member State. According to Article 26 (2) of Directive 2005/36/EC, the Commission has delegated powers, subject to the regulatory committee procedure, to insert a new medical speciality into Annex V, item 5.1.3., if the new medical speciality is common to at least two fifths of the Member States. Under the regulatory committee procedure, an agreement by a qualified majority should be reached first in view of inserting the medical speciality as such and secondly on the minimum training duration. The matter has been discussed in the Committee since 2005 and the Commission has provided for appropriate expertise in the field of oncology to assist discussions in the Committee. In spite of these efforts, preliminary positions indicated by Member States reveal that no qualified majority would be reached on the minimum training duration in the case of a formal vote. However, these discussions have also made clear that the situation is under review in some Member States in 2008 and that this may have an impact on the position taken at EU level. Therefore, the Commission intends to closely monitor the situation in these Member States and to re-examine the issue in the Committee as soon as this has been clarified.
