Question for written answer E-9145/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Morten Løkkegaard (ALDE) (4 November 2010) Subject: Compatibility of the Consumer Rights Directive with the Services Directive In its proposal for a directive on consumer rights (COD/2008/0196) the Commission seeks the full harmonisation of requirements concerning the information businesses (including service providers) must give the consumer before the conclusion of any consumer contract. This immediately raises the question of how to interpret the provisions of the Services Directive (2006/123/EC) concerning consumer information requirements, given that Article 22(5) of the directive permits Member States to impose ‘additional information requirements applicable to providers established in their territory’. Which directive should service providers comply with in future if the Commission’s proposal for fully harmonised information requirements in the Consumer Rights Directive is adopted?
