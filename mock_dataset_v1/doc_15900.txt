Member State. In practice, the level of childcare services differs considerably in the EU, but in most Member States it is below the Barcelona targets, notably for children younger than three years. In the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission encourages Member States to pay particular attention to accessible childcare for all in order to promote labour market participation. The increased attention that childcare receives in policy debates have been also reflected in the evolution of the scope of the European Social Fund (ESF). In the 2000‑06 period, actions relating to childcare were in principle implemented only as accompanying measures Regulation (EC) No 1784/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund, Article 3.2b(i), OJ L 213, 13.8.1999. , i.e. could be supported where necessary to ensure successful implementation of ESF main actions. In the 2007‑13 programming period, facilitating access to childcare has been recognised as a key element of improving access to employment and increasing sustainable participation and progress of women and has been explicitly mentioned in the new Regulation Article 3.1b(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 (OJ L 210, 31.7.2006) explicitly mentions ‘measures to reconcile work and private life, such as facilitating access to childcare and care for dependent persons’. . However, the Commission cannot, on its own, increase the EU funding available for the expansion of childcare provision. According to the principles of subsidiarity, the financial allocations to thematic priorities were defined by the Member States and negotiated with the Commission when Operational Programmes for 2007‑13 were adopted. While Operational Programmes allow for a certain flexibilibility, more substantial changes to the funding priorities must go through a formal revision agreed between the Commission and the Members States.
