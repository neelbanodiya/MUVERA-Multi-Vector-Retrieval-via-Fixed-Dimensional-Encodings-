ORAL QUESTION H-1033/05 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Ari Vatanen to the Commission Subject: Loophole in the registration of cars in Europe/Jiangling Landwind The Chinese Sports Utility Vehicle Jiangling Landwind has been crash-tested by the German automobile club ADAC in accordance with the Euro NCAP protocols. The test results were appalling and frightening. In the frontal crash, performed at a test speed of 64 km/h, the steering wheel intruded into the occupant compartment so violently that it would have killed the driver instantly. The FIA held a conference in Brussels on 29 November 2005 to address the issues at stake and the above-mentioned loophole in the European legislation. The following questions were raised during this debate: What will the Commission do to close this loophole and protect the lives of EU citizens? Does the Commission think that the 2500 kg limit for crash testing is still appropriate, given the trend towards heavier vehicle types, e.g. SUVs, and increased weight resulting from additional comfort and safety equipment? How is the Commission planning to make car designs more compatible in the event of a crash between cars? Therefore, my question to the European Commission is as follows: What are the next concrete steps, and what is their timetable, that the Commission intends to take so as to urgently prevent the introduction of patently dangerous cars on the European common market?
