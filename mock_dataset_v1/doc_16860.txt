Answer given by Ms Malmström on behalf of the Commission (4 March 2011) The Commission understands the questions as referring to so-called passenger name record data. European institutions and agencies do not collect and use such data. Such data are collected by carriers. In case such data are used by officials, these are Member State law enforcement officials. On 2 February 2011 the Commission proposed a regulatory framework for the collection and use of passenger name record data from air passenger for flights to and from the EU. It can be concluded from that proposal that at this stage the Commission does not envisage regulating at EU level the collection and use of passenger name record data for other modes of transport. This position, taken already in 2007 when the Commission tabled its first proposal for the collection and use of passenger name record data, has not changed, and was taken after the 2004 terrorist attacks in Madrid on commuter trains and the 2005 terrorist attacks on the London underground. The Commission cannot prejudge the position it might take with respect to the collection and use of passenger name record data for rail transport by Member States' law enforcement authorities in the future.
