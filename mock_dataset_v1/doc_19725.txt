Rule 163 Own-initiative reports 1. A committee intending to draw up a report and to submit a motion for a resolution to Parliament on a subject within its competence on which neither a consultation nor a request for an opinion has been referred to it pursuant to Rule 154(1) may do so only with the authorisation of the Conference of Presidents. Where such authorisation is withheld the reason must always be stated. 2. The provisions of this Rule shall apply mutatis mutandis in cases where the Treaties attribute the right of initiative to Parliament. In such cases, the Conference of Presidents shall take a decision within two months.
