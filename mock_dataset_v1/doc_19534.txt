Question for written answer E-005330/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Cristiana Muscardini (PPE) (1 June 2011) Subject: Volcanic eruption in Iceland ‘An eruption by Iceland’s largest active volcano put Europe on high alert today as a billowing ash cloud drifted toward Scotland and threatened to shut down airports across the northern edge of the continent from tomorrow morning.’ Thus began a Reuters dispatch issued at 14.34 on Monday, 23 May 2011. Eurocontrol, the European air traffic control organisation, said that if the ash emissions continued at the same rate the cloud might reach the airspace of western France and northern Spain on the Thursday. The dispatch went on to say that the closure of European airspace in 2010 had forced the cancellation of 100 000 flights, disrupted 10 million passengers and cost the industry an estimated EUR 1.212 billion in lost revenue. In the light of the adverse effects suffered by passengers in 2010, there had been numerous calls for rail travel to be consolidated and expanded so that such incidents would not paralyse passenger traffic across Europe again. 1. Can the Commission confirm the above information? 2. Has any action has been taken to consolidate rail travel, and if so by whom? 3. Has Eurocontrol reorganised its crisis unit in the light of accusations that its poor coordination contributed to last year’s emergency? 4. How much did Eurocontrol cost the EU budget in 2010?
