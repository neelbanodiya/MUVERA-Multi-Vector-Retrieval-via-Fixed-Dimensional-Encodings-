Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (29 September 2011) Directive 2008/98/EC on waste OJ L 312, 22.11.2008. requires that Member States take all the necessary measures to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health and without using processes or methods which could harm the environment. At the same time, incineration of waste is subject to extensive EU legislation, such as Directive 2000/76/EC OJ L 332, 28.12.2000. on the incineration of waste or Directive 2008/1/EC OJ L 24, 29.1.2008. concerning integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC Directive). The practice of burning cables and other materials containing metals to recover the metal content described by the Honourable Member does not comply with the abovementioned legislation. The Commission is aware of the practice of burning metal-containing waste in various regions of Greece in order to recover metals. The Commission has indicated to the Greek authorities that this practice is illegal and, as regards the management of hazardous waste, on 10 September 2009 the Court of Justice of the European Union found Greece to be in breach of a number of provisions of Directive 2006/12/EC OJ L 114, 27.4.2006, p. 9, repealed and replaced by Directive 2008/98/EC on waste. (Court Case C‑286/08), Directive 91/689/EC on hazardous waste OJ L 377, 31.12.1991, p. 20, repealed and replaced by Directive 2008/98/EC on waste. and Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste OJ L 182, 16.7.1999. . The Court found that the Waste Management Plan adopted in 2007 was not compliant with the requirements of the EU legislation applicable at that time (i.e. Directive 2006/12/EC) and that Greece was tolerating the uncontrolled disposal of the majority of such waste in sites which do not fulfil the requirements of Directive 1999/31/EC. In order to comply with the ruling, Greece has prepared an Action Plan which calls for the creation of an adequate network of facilities and sets intermediary targets. The Commission will keep on monitoring the progress made, and verify that the intermediary targets are met, so as to ensure the full execution of the Court ruling.
