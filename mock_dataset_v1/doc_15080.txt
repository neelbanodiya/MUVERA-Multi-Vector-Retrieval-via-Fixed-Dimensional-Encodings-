WRITTEN QUESTION E-2716/04 by Christopher Huhne (ALDE) to the Commission (29 October 2004) Subject: Top personal marginal tax rates Will the Commission state the top marginal rate of personal tax on incomes in each Member State and also the threshold at which this rate begins to operate, expressed in euros and also as a percentage of median earnings? Will it compare these figures for the purposes of benchmarking competitiveness with Japan and with the residents of New York State and of California (so that local income taxes are taken into account)?
