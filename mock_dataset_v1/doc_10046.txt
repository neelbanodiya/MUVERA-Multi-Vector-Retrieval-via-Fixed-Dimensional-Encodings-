Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 October 2007) The Commission is aware that fluoride (F) provides protection of teeth against dental caries when this substance is present in drinking water in low concentrations. This particularly applies to children. Concentrations of 0.5 milligram (mg) up to 2 mg F/litre lead to the development of teeth which are less prone to decay The World Health Organisation Guidelines for drinking water quality , Geneva 2004, ISBN 92 4154 638 7. . However, in high concentrations fluoride can cause dental fluorosis or even dental or skeletal decay, depending on the intake. In its Guidelines for drinking water quality, the World Health Organisation (WHO) sets a guideline value of 1.5 mg F/litre. The objective of the EU Drinking Water Directive Council Directive 98/83/EC of 3 November 1998 on the quality of water intended for human consumption, OJ L 330, 5.12.1998. is to protect human health from the adverse effects of any contamination. The directive sets a maximum concentration of 1.5 mg F/litre. Following the directive, the Commission considers Member States that add fluoride to drinking water to remain in compliance with the directive, if the concentration of fluoride in the distributed water does not exceed the maximum parameter value of 1.5 mg F/litre. Any possible decision by individual Member States to add fluoride to drinking water is a national decision which does not flow from any obligation under Community law. The Biomedecines Convention has been opened for signature by the Council of Europe in Oviedo in 1997. The Convention has not been ratified at this stage by the Community and for the time being it has no legal effects in the Community. Moreover, it is noted that according to the information available to the Commission, none of the Members States which add fluoride to drinking water Ireland and the United Kingdom. are party to the Convention.
