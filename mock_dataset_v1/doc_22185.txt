Question for written answer E-008858/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Francisco Sosa Wagner (NI) (6 October 2011) Subject: Catalan river basin management plan Directive 2000/60/EC of 23 October 2000, which regulates the framework for Community action in the field of water policy, laid down the obligation that a management plan should be produced for each river basin by the end of 2009 (Article 13). In June of this year, the Commission announced that it was taking Spain to the EU Court of Justice for failure to comply with this obligation. However, in the press release issued by the Commission itself, it was specified that one management plan had been adopted and communicated, namely the Catalan river basin management plan. The administrative authorities in the autonomous community of Catalonia also stated that the European Commission had endorsed the management plan they had drawn up. The fact is that this plan was only approved by the Government a short while ago on 5 September 2011, as recorded in the Boletín Oficial del Estado [official journal of the Spanish state] on 22 September. Back in June, therefore, it had not been approved in accordance with the provisions of Spanish legislation (Article 40 of the Law on Water). — Does the Commission consider that, under the Treaties, it has some power to approve or endorse working documents or drafts of river basin management plans independently of the provisions of Member States’ laws? — Why did the Commission state in June that the Catalan river basin management plan was approved, when the procedure for adopting the plan had not yet been completed as was the case, incidentally, with other water plans?
