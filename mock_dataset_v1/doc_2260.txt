WRITTEN QUESTION E-5716/06 by Marco Pannella (ALDE) to the Commission (5 January 2007) Subject: Detention and hunger strike — Professor Kozulin in Belarus The former rector of the Belarusian State University, Professor Alexander Kozulin, who, together with Alexander Milinkevich, challenged Alexander Lukashenko in the last presidential election, was arrested and sentenced to five-and-a half years' imprisonment for organising and taking part in a number of demonstrations against the vote-rigging carried out by the Belarusian authorities during the 2006 presidential election. This fraud was also confirmed by the OSCE through its Chairman-in-Office, the Belgian Minister Karel De Gucht, in a press release of 21 September 2006. On 20 October 2006 Kozulin began an indefinite hunger strike to protest against his sentence and to appeal to the international community to take action against the unlawful practices of the Belarusian authorities. According to the ‘charter97.org’ website, the Minister of the Interior has stated that Professor Kozulin ended his hunger strike on 11 December, after 53 days, at the time of the award of the Sakharov Prize to Milinkevich, who dedicated the prize to Kozulin. Shortly before he began his hunger strike, Professor Kozulin appealed to democratic forces to submit a petition to the UN Commission on Human Rights calling for the post of Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in Belarus to be maintained and for a discussion on the Belarus issue to be held subsequently within the UN Security Council. Other political prisoners are currently held in Belarusian prisons. — Does the Commission intend to verify Kozulin's state of health through an independent medical commission? — What measures will the Commission take at UN level to meet the legitimate requests of Professor Kozulin and ensure that all Belarusian political prisoners are released as soon as possible? — In what way does it plan to use EIDHR resources to support civil society groups and opposition parties suffering repression at the hands of President Lukashenko's regime?
