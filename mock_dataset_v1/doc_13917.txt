Commission adopted the first stage consultation of the social partners ‘Anticipating and managing change: a dynamic approach to the social aspects of corporate restructuring’. The paper advocated a positive approach to corporate restructuring balancing the interests of businesses faced with changes in the conditions governing their activity and those of employees threatened with the loss of their jobs. In response to the paper, the social partners agreed to explore the possibilities of social dialogue on this issue and included it as a key element of their joint work programme adopted in November 2002. Following a number of seminars exploring practical experience on restructuring, the social partners submitted to the Commission in October 2003 a joint text ‘Orientations for reference in managing change and its social consequences’. The Commission very much welcomes the fact that the social partners have indicated their intention to pursue work on topics relevant to this theme under their work programme for the period 2003-2005. As regards the dissemination and the application of the agreed orientations, together with other instruments and actions, social dialogue at different levels will undoubtedly be asked to play a useful role in developing and applying those principles throughout the EU. With regard to the second question, while it does not examine at the moment whether it is possible to provide new incentives for companies planning to relocate to countries with cheap labour and more favourable tax conditions to remain in the EU, the Commission holds the view that the maintenance of companies within the EU depends on a complex multitude of factors, notably on the presence and effectiveness of appropriate framework conditions. In the light of this complexity, it can be presumed that the addition of new incentives would prove unable to prevent relocation, when it occurs, in any significant proportion of cases.
