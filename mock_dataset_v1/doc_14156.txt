as tax discrimination against cross-border life insurance payments, should concern all work-related pension schemes in every Member State, independent of how these schemes are embedded in national pillar structures; asks the European Commission to define general principles with sufficient flexibility for the Member States to accommodate them within their own (legal) structures; 22. Considers therefore that, as it is in the best interests of the European Union and the Member States to increase workers’ mobility, obstacles to internal and cross-border mobility must be removed and issues such as lack of transferability, long vesting periods, preservation of dormant rights, non-regression and differences in tax treatment and actuarial principles must be addressed; 23. Calls on the Commission to clarify certain definitions in the IORP-directive, in particular the concept of cross-border activity, while taking into account that the definition of ‘pension fund’ differs within the Member States; 24. Acknowledges that for (third-pillar) individual pension insurance schemes being offered across borders, such as life insurance policies, obstacles remain; requests suggestions from the Commission as to how these might be overcome, as well as a framework for regulating these activities.
