Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (10 May 2005) At Community level, detention conditions of asylum‑seekers are regulated by Council Directive 2003/9 Council Directive 2003/9/EC of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum‑seekers, OJ L 31 , 6.2.2003. laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum‑seekers. However, this act only demands that basic needs and an adequate standard of living for asylum‑seekers in detention are guaranteed. The maintenance costs of detention centres for asylum‑seekers are not regulated by the directive and they remain the exclusive competence of the Member States. Consequently, the Commission does not have the data requested by the Honourable Member on the amounts of money spent by each Member State on immigration detention centres for asylum‑seekers. Some Member States occasionally use some small amounts of their national allocation from the European Refugee Fund (ERF) to co-finance projects at national level aimed at improving social and legal conditions in relation to the situation of asylum‑seekers in closed reception centres or pre-return centres (such as counselling etc…). However, as the ERF is managed under a shared management methodology, it is not possible for the Commission to identify the exact amounts dedicated for such projects managed at national level. Finally, it should be recalled that the situation of illegal immigrants, including the maintenance costs of immigration detention centres for these persons, is not regulated at Community level.
