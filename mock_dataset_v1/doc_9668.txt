Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (17 February 2005) On 3 September 2004, the Commission did indeed decide, following the procedure of Article 82 of the Euratom Treaty, to refer the case to the Court of Justice. However, the Commission’s concern is to ensure a speedy and satisfactory remediation of the situation that initiated the issue of its Directive of 30 March 2004. Therefore, notwithstanding the decision to refer the United Kingdom (UK) to the Court, the Commission pursues contacts with the UK authorities, which included an informal meeting with representatives of the UK Department of Trade and Industry held on 17 September 2004, followed by an exchange of correspondence. In particular, the UK authorities have recently sent to the Commission a report with additional information to the draft plan they had submitted in June, which is at present being carefully examined by the Commission's services.
