Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (7 February 2006) The EU Public Procurement Directives 2004/17/EC Article 34(1) and Annex XXI of Directive 2004/17/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004, coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. and 2004/18/EC Article 23(1) and Annex VI of Directive 2004/18/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004, on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, OJ L 134, 30.4.2004. refer explicitly to these elements. They state that ‘whenever possible … technical specifications should be defined so as to take into account accessibility criteria for people with disabilities or design for all users’, however, without being compulsory. Both directives have to be implemented into Member States' legislation by 31 January 2006.
