the policy areas this Committee looks after sees an increase of 1,8% or EUR 166 400 000 to a total of EUR 9 129 000 000 for commitment appropriations. In contrast to the importance of the Internal Market as briefly set out above, Title 12 concerning the internal market is cut down by a third, precisely by 33% or EUR 3 300 000 , from EUR 10 million in 2005 to EUR 6 700 000 in 2006 for commitment appropriations. These appropriations are available for expert opinions, conferences, the SOLVIT system, Public Relations and expenditure on business impact studies and most importantly on implementation and preparatory studies prior to proposing new legislation. The proposed reductions seem to be contrary to the political priorities as expressed in the Commission's annual policy strategy document that identified Internal Market actions as deliverables linked to the Lisbon Strategy. Furthermore the above mentioned enlargement and the yet to be completed Internal Market requires continuing efforts. In particular budget line 12.0201 for implementation and development of the internal market has seen a dramatic reduction shrinking to a level which is even below the 2004 one. The success, especially of the SOLVIT system, whose real effect is only now measurable, underpins the fact that this reduction is questionable, to say the least. Even though a part of the funds has been transferred to DG Enterprise, it is assumed that action to sensitise business and citizen awareness actions should be reinforced. Therefore, the following amendment is proposed: 1) Budget line 12.0201 should be increased from EUR 6 700 000 as proposed to EUR 7 500 000, which would still be below the average of the 2004 commitment appropriations as compared to the 2005 commitment appropriations, given that in 2005 the more immediate effects of the 2004 enlargement probably need to be covered. It would be premature to assume that the transition period after enlargement will be completed by 31 December 2005. 2. Customs Union Commitment appropriations for the policy area taxation and customs union under subheading 14 is proposed to increase by 5,9% or EUR 3 410 000 to EUR 61 620 000. Budget line 14.02.01 concerning the implementation and development receives EUR 600 000 more in comparison with the budget figures for the year 2005 while the customs 2007 programme sees a decrease of EUR 490 000 in commitment appropriations. Considering that the Community could achieve that
