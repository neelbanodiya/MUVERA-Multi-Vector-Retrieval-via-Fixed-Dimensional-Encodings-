Question for written answer E-006506/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sophia in 't Veld (ALDE) , Antonyia Parvanova (ALDE) , Françoise Castex (S&D) , Véronique Mathieu (PPE) , Norbert Neuser (S&D) , Sirpa Pietikäinen (PPE) and Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE) (1 July 2011) Subject: Follow-up 1 billion EU MDG Initiative At the UN High-Level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals on 20 September 2010, the European Union offered EUR 1 billion to reinforce efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Guidelines were sent out to the EU delegations in which it was explained how this initiative should be implemented. The first phase of the implementation consists of the relaunch or update of the EU‑ACP policy dialogue on MDGs. It is stated that the role of the delegation is to ensure that this policy dialogue phase takes place and where possible involve representatives of local authorities, national parliaments and civil society organisations. Could the Commission give an overview, per country, of where this dialogue is taking place and to what extent/how civil society is involved? After this phase, ACP governments will submit proposals (concept notes), which will then be assessed, and the funding decision will be made by the EDF committee and the Commission. How will the Commission ensure that this process is transparent and how will Parliament be informed of the final decisions?
