The precautionary principle basically means that possible catches of fish species should be set at a level which will amply guarantee the conservation of the species in the medium and long term, securing an adequate level of specimens of breeding age which will allow the necessary renewal of biological cycles, the guiding principle being to maintain stocks at adequate levels to guarantee the optimum exploitation of the resource. It is now widely recognised that the instruments used in Community fisheries policy to ensure the conservation of fishery resources at satisfactory levels have not proved as effective as had been hoped, the clearest evidence of this failure being provided by the increasingly worrying situation which is gradually spreading to affect more and more species. Suffice it to mention the recent deep crises to hit such major fisheries as North Sea cod, Atlantic hake and the previously abundant stocks of sardines along the Spanish and Portuguese coast. The fact that the instruments used in Community fisheries policy have not succeeded in stabilising resources or favouring their regeneration does not necessarily imply that they were not appropriate. In many cases, they would have proved suitable mechanisms if they had been applied consistently. One example is provided by the issue of TACs, the measure at the centre of this communication. Nobody would dispute that the establishment of a system of TACs set on a multiannual and multi-species basis will allow a more rational exploitation of resources, while making it easier for the industry to define its options in terms of economic planning, but even the current system of setting annual TACs for each species is perfectly compatible with a suitable policy on the conservation of fishery resources, since the underlying problem is not the question of whether TACs are annual or multiannual but the need for the decision taken on their application to be consistent with the data provided by scientists on the actual state of stocks. This is not currently the case, given that the facts show that TACs in recent years have always been set at higher levels than those which scientists were recommending, the aim being to cushion the negative socio-economic impact of a decision taken in line with what should have been considered advisable in the light of the scientific data. There is a broad tradition of applying the precautionary principle in relation to the exploitation of natural resources and
