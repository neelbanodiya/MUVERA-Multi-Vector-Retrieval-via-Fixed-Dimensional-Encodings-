9999/C Q999 E/109 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1119/04 by Michl Ebner (PPE-DE) to the Commission (31 March 2004) Subject: Equal Opportunities The European Union bases itself on principles such as democracy and the rule of law and also on equal opportunities. The introduction of a full school day for the whole of the EU area would be a real help for working women. There are already successful examples in the Scandinavian states and also in Belgium. With the introduction of a full school day, the burden on women would be eased. What steps is the Commission taking in order to promote the introduction of these schools in all Member States?
