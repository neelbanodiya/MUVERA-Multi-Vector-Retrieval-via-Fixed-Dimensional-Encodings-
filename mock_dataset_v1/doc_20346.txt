with the strict requirements, of Part B of Directive 2001/18/EC Directive 2001/18/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC, OJ L 106, 17.4.2001. , comprising inspection and control measures. In this context, the Commission is aware that some Member States are undertaking research activities on fertility and sterility, which will certainly contribute to the scientific undertanding of this issue. In line with the information exchange mechanism established under Directive 2001/18/EC, the Joint Research Centre makes information provided by Member States on Part B releases under Directive 2001/18/EC publicly available on: http://gmoinfo.jrc.it/gmp_browse_geninf.asp. 5. It is not appropriate to refer to Decision V/5 as a ‘moratorium’ on GURTS. The Commission believes that Decision V/5 addresses the issue of GURTs in a cautious and sensible way. The Commission supports in particular that appropriate scientific data on the environmental and socioeconomic impacts is needed before a GURT could be approved for release into the environment. As regards potential approvals of GURTS in the EU, the Commission considers that the regulatory regime on GMOs is in line with the strict precautionary approach to this technology set out in Decision V/5. The EU legislative framework on GMOs requires comprehensive scientific evaluations to be carried out prior to any relase and does fully acknowledge the potential irreversible effects of releases of GMOs into the environment. Only GMOs considered to be safe for human health and the environment should receive final consent. The Commission therefore does not see the need for stronger measures.
