ORAL QUESTION H-0913/05 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Péter Olajos to the Commission Subject: Registration tax on used cars in Hungary On 14 October the Commission threatened to initiate infringement proceedings against Hungary with a view to bringing about a change in the motor vehicle registration tax. Many people claim that the Commission desires a change which would make it more profitable to import outdated, more polluting cars into Hungary, thus harming the country’s environment. Does not the Commissioner consider that it would be worthwhile to review the Member States’ divergent practices at Commission level, but with the express aim not of encouraging the export of wrecks, but instead of promoting the distribution of up-to-date, less polluting cars?
