Joint answer given by Ms Vassiliou on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-8031/10 , P-8604/10 (15 November 2010) In the light of budgetary constraints at national and European levels, the Commission has taken the view that there is no scope to put forward a meaningful proposal for a Sport Programme in the framework of the current multi-annual financing framework which runs until 2013. The Commission is, however, pursuing its aim of adopting a Communication on an EU sports agenda in 2010. The communication will set out the Commission's proposals for priorities for the EU's approach to sport for the coming years. While fully respecting the Treaty provisions on sport, it will build on the progress achieved in implementing the 2007 White Paper on Sport, in particular as regards the mainstreaming of sport in other EU policies, programmes and funds, so as to ensure the most effective use of resources. The Commission will also continue to support the Preparatory Actions voted by the Budgetary Authority in the field of sport at European level. The Commission will soon launch an evaluation of the Preparatory Actions that will be finalised in 2011, in time to feed into the impact assessment of a possible future EU Sport Programme covering the post‑2013 financing period.
