Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (7 June 2011) A special funding programme exists for co-funding of the operation of European environmental NGOs. The legal base for programme is the LIFE+ Regulation Regulation (EC) No 614/2007 of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+), OJ L 149, 9.6.2007. adopted by the Council and the European Parliament in May 2007. This regulation explicitly provides for annual operating grants to environmental European NGOs. According to the legal base, NGOs should be ‘involved in the development and implementation of EU policy and legislation’ to be eligible for funding. Such activities may include campaigning and advocacy work. Co-funding of the operation of European environmental NGOs is provided in the context of good governance and broad stakeholder involvement. European NGO umbrellas and networks ensure the coordination of the views and opinions of their local members and provide coordinated input to the policy process. The financial support ensures a critical level of participation of European environmental NGOs as stakeholders in the EU policy process, balancing the interests of other stakeholders. The Commission does not, however, have control over the NGOs' views. Beneficiaries are free to present their views and express themselves as they wish as a part of a democratic process, using the means and methods of their choice. Their participation ensures a wide discussion and debate in EU policy development and ensures that the EU institutions have access to the full range of inputs.
