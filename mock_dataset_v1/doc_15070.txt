Answer given by Mr Spidla on behalf of the Commission (26 October 2005) Attention is drawn to a previous reply given on 14 April 2005 to the Honourable Member's Written Question E‑0965/05 on the subject of equal treatment of people with disabilities in selection procedures for civil servants in Greece. Administrative and legislative procedures in connection with employment are matters of national competence for the Member States. However, activity at Community level has an important impact upon the situation of people with disabilities in all aspects of their daily lives including their employment situation. The Commission therefore strongly supports the fact that people with disabilities are entitled to equal treatment, equal opportunities and equal access to rights in the same way as all citizens of the European Union. This approach was emphasised by the Commission in its communication of 30 October 2003 entitled: ‘Equal opportunities for people with disabilities in the EU: A European action plan’ COM(2003)650 final. . Towards the end of 2005, the Commission will publish a further communication which will identify priority actions for the second phase of the action plan for the period 2006‑2007. These actions will continue to support the European Union's objective of equality of opportunities for people with disabilities.
