Unaccompanied minors shall, as far as possible, be provided with access to accommodation in institutions provided with personnel and facilities taking into account the needs of persons of their age.

The Return Directive is due to be transposed by Member States into national legislation by 24 December 2010. The Commission is not in a position to take formal steps regarding compliance with this directive before that date, but it encourages all Member States to ensure compliance with the standards fixed by the directive as quickly as possible. The Commission allocates financial support to Greece to ensure inter alia proper reception conditions for asylum applicants including those held in detention centres. Support for Greece under the European Refugee Fund (ERF) in 2008 amounted to EUR 1.6 million and to EUR 3.3 million in 2009. The ERF allocation earmarked for 2010 is EUR 4.8 million. Additionally, in 2008 and 2009 Greece received financial support for emergency measures amounting to EUR 2.2 million and EUR 4.9 million respectively in order to reinforce its reception capacities.
