Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (22 January 2007) The feasibility study entitled ‘Medsea’ on reinforcing monitoring and surveillance of the southern maritime border of the EU, namely in the Mediterranean Sea, and on a Mediterranean Coastal Patrols Network involving Member States and North African countries was presented by Frontex on 14 July 2006 as part of the implementation of the Global Approach to Migration. This study indicates that it is necessary to establish a permanent Coastal Patrol Network for the southern maritime external borders. The Commission's communication on reinforcing the management of the European Union's southern maritime borders adopted on 30 November 2006 COM(2006)733 final. underlined that this patrol network would have a real added value, making it possible for Member States to coordinate their patrol schedules, pool their civilian and military assets and exchange strategic and tactical information in real time. The network should be established and managed by Frontex together with the Member States of the region as soon as possible, preferably before the start of the so-called peak season of illegal migratory movements via the Mediterranean. The European Council, in its conclusions adopted on 14-15 December 2006, stated that priority will be given to establishing, as soon as possible by Frontex, together with the Member States of the region, a permanent Medsea Coastal Patrol Network and to examining the creation of a European surveillance system for the southern maritime borders. For further details please refer to Chapter 2, point 2.1 of the abovementioned communication.
