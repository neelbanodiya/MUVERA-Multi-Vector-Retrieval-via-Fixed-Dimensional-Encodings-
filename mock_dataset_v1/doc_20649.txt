ORAL QUESTION H-0508/07 for Question Time at the part-session in July 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Toussas to the Council Subject: Violent suppression of strike in Nigeria The oil-producing industry in Nigeria is a strategic sector in that country, which is the eighth largest oil-producing country in the world and the leading producer in Africa. The oil-industry trade unions in Nigeria have been engaged in industrial action since 19 June 2007, threatening to stop oil exports unless the government lowers the extremely high fuel prices. The participation of many thousands in strike action in the country's major cities was followed by the arrest of 50 trade union officials in the south-eastern state of Enugu, according to the Nigerian Labour Congress, which is protesting that the present government of the new President, Umaru Yar'Adua, continues to apply heavy-handed police measures. Does the Council condemn the operation to suppress this justified strike in Nigeria, particularly in the light of the mass arrests and the intimidation of trade unionists in the oil industry?
