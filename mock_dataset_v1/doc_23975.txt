Answer given by Mr Lewandowski on behalf of the Commission (9 January 2012) National parliaments have been brought into the discussion about the future of EU own resources in different ways. For the first time, a conference on the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020 was held in Brussels on 20-21 October 2011 which gathered representatives from national parliaments and all EU institutions. It was based on an initiative from the European Parliament and organised jointly by the Polish Council Presidency and the Commission. This conference gave national Parliaments the opportunity to discuss the MFF proposals and explain their main concerns and interests at an early stage of the process. It seems likely that a second conference will be held during the first half of 2012. In general terms, following its initiative launched in 2006, the Commission has kept an ongoing political dialogue with national Parliaments aimed at improving the process of policy formulation and bringing Europe closer to its citizens. The political dialogue was reinforced after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and with the implementation of the measures required by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union to involve national Parliaments in the policy making process, particularly as regards subsidiarity control. Finally, Members of the Commission maintain regular individual contacts with national Parliaments, which provide them with opportunities to clarify and defend the Commission proposals.
