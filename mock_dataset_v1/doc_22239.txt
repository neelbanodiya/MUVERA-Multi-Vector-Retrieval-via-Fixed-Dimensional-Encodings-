Question for written answer P-007736/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (9 August 2011) Subject: Arrest of Ahmed Ezz Mr Ahmed Ezz is an Egyptian businessman who was arrested on 17 February 2011 following the fall of President Hosni Mubarak. The allegations against him include complex economic crimes and conspiring with public officials. However, many fear that Mr Ezz will be unable to receive a fair trial in Egypt because of the political climate in the country and his former relationship with the National Democratic Party and the Mubarak regime. According to reports, Mr Ezz was denied bail and house arrest, a violation of his defence rights in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Mr Ezz's defence lawyers were unable to have access to the indictment and prosecution file in sufficient time to review the evidence before the first hearing, when the trial was adjourned. His lawyers withdrew from the case on that basis; however, the trial was held from 11 to 16 June, and a verdict will be issued on 6 September. The injustices Mr Ezz has faced call seriously into question the possibility of his receiving a fair trial in Egypt. Based on the evidence up to this point, the Egyptian authorities have been greatly influenced by the current revolutionary fervour and the desire to separate themselves from the Mubarak regime, unfairly targeting politicians and businessmen associated with the previous regime. 1. What can the Commission do to ensure that Mr Ezz receives a fair trial in Egypt that is not influenced by his previous ties to the Mubarak regime? 2. What actions can the Commission take to ensure that in Egypt's democratic transition the principles of justice are upheld, both in the process of setting up the new government and in the prosecution of those who committed crimes under Mubarak?
