WRITTEN QUESTION E-0868/07 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (23 February 2007) Subject: Climate change The climate change to which our planet will be subject in the decades to come may be worse than anticipated. This is the view of German scientists on the basis of data on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, the air temperature and sea levels. Their data have been compared with changes predicted in the 2001 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The German scientists have observed that the increase in the average temperature on land and sea has been higher than predicted by the IPCC. The German scientists’ study shows that the rise in sea levels was 25 % higher than in any other 20-year period in the last 115 years. Obvious efforts are being made to improve the environment, but no results have been registered by the research mentioned above. Would the Commission say what measures it is taking or plans to take to combat climate change?
