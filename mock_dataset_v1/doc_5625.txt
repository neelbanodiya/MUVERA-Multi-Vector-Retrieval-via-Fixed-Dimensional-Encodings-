The amended regulation was adopted by 646 votes in favour, with 22 votes against and 9 abstentions. MEPs backed by large majority a compromise agreement reached with Council on the extension of the 2007 roaming regulation. The regulation does not fix roaming prices at rates set by the EU, but sets ceilings beneath which mobile operators can compete by offering lower prices. The existing 2007 roaming regulation lays down that from 1 July 2009 consumers will have to pay a maximum of €0.43 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.19 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls. The new legislative text sets roaming phone call caps for 2010 and 2011 - i.e. home operators may charge their customers for a roaming phone call: from 1 July 2010: a maximum of €0.39 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.15 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls;from 1 July 2011: a maximum of €0.35 per minute (excluding VAT) for outgoing and a maximum of €0.11 per minute (excluding VAT) for incoming roaming calls. MEPs and the Council Presidency agreed with the Commission that a roamed text message (SMS) should cost a maximum of €0.11 (excluding VAT) from 1 July 2009. Other data roaming services (such as sending emails and pictures or web-browsing from mobile phones or laptops) will be regulated at wholesale level – i.e. there will be a price cap for the rates the host operator charges a roaming customer’s home operator, calculated on a kilobyte basis: from 1 July 2009: a maximum of €1.00 per megabyte (excluding VAT);from 1 July 2010: a maximum of €0.80 per megabyte (excluding VAT);from 1 July 2011: a maximum of €0.50 per megabyte (excluding VAT).
