Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (18 November 2004) 1. Article 70(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC Directive 2001/83/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use, OJ L 311, 28.11.2001 as amended by Commission Directive 2003/63/EC of 25 June 2003, OJ L 159, 27.6.2003 . as amended states: ‘When a marketing authorization is granted, the competent authorities shall specify the classification of the medicinal product into: — a medicinal product subject to medical prescription, — a medicinal product not subject to medical prescription’. Therefore it is within the responsibilities of the competent authorities of Member States to decide on the legal status of a medicinal product. 2. Article 70(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended states: ‘The competent authorities may fix sub-categories for medicinal products which are available on medical prescription only. In that case, they shall refer to the following classification: — medicinal products on renewable or non-renewable medical prescription; — medicinal products subject to special medical prescription; — medicinal products on restricted medical prescription, reserved for use in certain specialized areas’. Therefore the competent authorities of Member States may restrict the medicinal prescription status of a medicinal product. 3. Article 71(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC states: ‘Where Member States provide for the sub-category of medicinal products subject to restricted prescription, they shall take account of the following factors: — the medicinal product, because of its pharmaceutical characteristics or novelty or in the interests of public health, is reserved for treatments which can only be followed in a hospital environment, or — the medicinal product is used in the treatment of conditions which must be diagnosed in a hospital environment or in institutions with adequate diagnostic facilities, although administration and follow-up may be carried out elsewhere […]’. Therefore the competent authorities of Member States may restrict the medicinal prescription status of a medicinal product if this decision is based on the above mentioned factors.
