to EUR 61 620 000. Budget line 14.02.01 concerning the implementation and development receives EUR 600 000 more in comparison with the budget figures for the year 2005 while the customs 2007 programme sees a decrease of EUR 490 000 in commitment appropriations. Considering that the Community could achieve that all 10 new Member States were fully equipped upon accession with the necessary tools, especially IT installations, the functioning and security of the supply chain as well as the protection of own resources could be secured at an early point in time. Therefore, the budgetary provisions are considered to respect the needs in this policy area as it would allow catching up with the actual execution of commitments for which contracts have been concluded but respective programme requests are still to be formalised. Therefore, the following amendment is proposed: 1) Budget line 14.0201 should remain at the level as initially proposed of EUR 3 500 000 for commitment appropriations. The reduction proposed by Council cannot be accepted. 3. Consumer Protection For title 17 (health and consumer protection), the preliminary draft budget foresees an 18,9 % increase in commitment appropriations (EUR 22 747 000 000), whereas both budget lines in relation to consumer protection (17.01.04.03 and 17.02.01) are not granted any increase. Referring to the statements about the size and importance of the EU's Internal Market, Consumer Protection is one of the most positive and visible aspects of the EU and close to its citizens. Therefore, this sector should be strengthened in view of the yet underdeveloped structures for effective consumer protection in the new Member States. Although noting that the negotiations on the financial perspectives are yet to be concluded, it is worth mentioning the foreseen doubling of the funds available for this policy area as of 2007. It is a known phenomenon that new programmes take off with some delay in terms of effective execution of available funds. Agreeing with the envisaged increase for this policy area as of 2007, it seems counterproductive to keep the 2006 envelope at the same level as in 2005 just the year before this envelope shall be increased by 100%. In addition that would take effect in the transition period following the 2004 enlargement. Another important element is linked to the experience after the introduction of the Euro in 12 of the 15 Member States as at the time of the introduction. The
