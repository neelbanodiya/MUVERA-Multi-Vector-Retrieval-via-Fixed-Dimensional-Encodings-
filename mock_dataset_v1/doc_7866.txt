milk and milk products, for example, these are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common market organisation of the market in milk and milk products OJ L 160, 26.6.1999. . The procedures for exports with a claim to refunds are provided in the horizontal regulations: Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products. OJ L 102, 17.4.1999. and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code. OJ L 302, 19.10.1992. and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code. OJ L 253, 11.10.1993. . The granting of refunds is done through the managements committee for the products concerned often through a tendering system. Summaries of the managements committee are publicly available on the website of the DG AGRI: http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/index_en.htm.

The overall budgetary expenditures on export subsidies for the whole of the agricultural sector, covering all products for which export subsidies are granted, amounted to around EUR 3 billion in 2003. This covers subsidised exports to all third countries and not just the developing world. The Commission annually notifies to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) regarding the use of export subsidies, which inter alia specifies the amount of subsidies used for each agricultural sector.
