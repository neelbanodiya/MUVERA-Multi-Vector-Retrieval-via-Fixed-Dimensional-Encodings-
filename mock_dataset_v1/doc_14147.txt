respect, for example, to pensions portals; 19. Notes that the divergent wage and social security levels in the Member States do not permit or justify an EU-wide harmonised minimum pension; 20. Notes the contribution that may be made by working longer and, at the same time, realises that workers generally do not work until the age at which they are entitled to draw full pension; takes note of the fact that employees in the most onerous occupational categories tend to retire earlier than others; considers that, in view of demographic trends and the need to ensure that pensions can be paid for, it is necessary for more people to participate in the labour market on a long-term basis; stresses that one of the important priorities for achieving sustainability is to enable people to work until retirement age without discrimination, by implementing adequate enhancing policies with regard to employment and social provision – e.g. discouraging early retirement, introducing financial incentives and securing lifelong learning and adequate healthcare; 21. Believes that high economic growth is a precondition for achieving a higher level of employment and thus securing the financial base of public pension schemes; notes, therefore, that the EU should focus on means of achieving high and sustainable economic growth and a high employment rate; calls on the Commission and the Member States, in this regard, to facilitate labour-market reforms with the aim of factoring in flexicurity principles, to modernise social protection systems and to foster an environment in which companies can create jobs; 22. Considers that setting the retirement age is an issue to be addressed according to the subsidiarity principle, considering the variety of national, demographic and labour-force situations, and taking into account life expectancy, health and working conditions, among other factors; is of the opinion, however, that Member States should coordinate their pension policy strategies, using the open method of coordination (OMC); supports a policy of clear communication with citizens to ensure that people fully understand the level of pension they can expect; 23. Calls for a Commission study on the extent of cross-border labour mobility; 24. Calls for an examination of whether pension insurance associations, such as those that exist in Luxembourg and Germany to protect the second pillar in the event of bankruptcy, can be recommended to other Member States as a hedging mechanism and best practice; 25. Considers that, in view of the widely differing nature
