Convention; 15. Notes that pursuant to the procedures provided for under the Technical Arrangement currently in force between the EU and Israel, on the one hand , and between EFTA and Israel , on the other, Israel’ s customs authorities and exporters already make a distinction between production operations carried out in Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories and production carried out in the internationally-recognised territory of the State of Israel; note s that these procedures do not provide for the communication of the outcome of the distinctions made by Israel's authorities and exporters so as to enable the EU customs authorities to apply the same distinctions correctly, simply and efficiently; calls on the Commission to work together with the customs authorities of the Member States to find a solution aimed at turning this technical arrangement into a simple, efficient and reliable mechanism; 16. Considers that a simple, efficient and reliable mechanism to replace the existing technical arrangement should be agreed with Israel, pursuant to which Israel’s exporters and customs authorities would apply the same distinction and clearly and appropriately indicate when they have assigned originating status to products on the basis of production operations carried out in territories brought under Israel’s administration in 1967; 17. Urges the Member States to ensure that their customs authorities effectively apply the Technical Arrangement and the spirit of the judgment of the European Court of Justice to Israeli cumulated products entering the EU under the diagonal cumulation provided for in the regional Convention; believes that the Commission should take the lead in coordinating such EU-wide efforts and should also take steps to create awareness among the customs authorities of the individual EU Member States as to how the Technical Arrangement should be applied to Israeli cumulated products; believes that the EU customs authorities should scrutinise the application of the Technical Arrangement more effectively in order to prevent abuse of the system of preferences; 18. As no such provision exists in the text of the Convention , asks the Commission to carry out an impact assessment after three years in order to evaluate, inter alia , the benefits created by the adoption of the Convention and the impact of the cumulation brought about by the Convention on the practices of certain companies referred to above; 19. Emphasises the need to increase awareness of the opportunities offered by cumulation as simplified by the new Pan-Euro-Mediterranean
