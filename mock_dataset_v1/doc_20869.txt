2004/C 65 E/071 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1215/03 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (2 April 2003) Subject: Use of funds under the Framework for action on sustainable urban development in the European Union by the municipality of Massa In September 2002, the monitoring committee of the Italian Ministry for Economic Affairs issued a report on the spending of EU funds. The report reveals the alarming slowness and inefficiency with which EU funds are allocated to projects by some regional authorities. The grave concerns about the inadequate use of European funds by local authorities have frequently been echoed by the Commission. Bearing in mind that some local authorities, such as the municipality of Massa, urgently need to use European funds to promote sustainable urban development, can the Commission state: 1. whether the municipality of Massa has submitted projects for the Framework for action on sustainable urban development in the European Union? 2. whether the municipality of Massa has secured funding for these projects? 3. whether this funding has been used?
