Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2012) The principle of non-discrimination on the basis of gender is one of the fundamental principles of the EU. The EU is therefore of the clear view that it is unacceptable to discriminate against women in any area. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) sets out this principle — along with many others — in international law. The EU believes that all states — including Saudi Arabia — should ratify and implement CEDAW, without reservations. This issue — and more generally that of discrimination vis-à-vis women in the country — was raised by Member States during the Universal Periodic Review that Saudi Arabia underwent at the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council in 2009. The EU holds regular high-level exchanges of views with Saudi Arabia and the other five Gulf countries. The latest EU‑Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Ministerial Meeting took place in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) on 20 April 2011. On that occasion, the EU side recalled the crucial importance of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms and of listening to the legitimate grievances expressed by the citizens of those countries. A firm reference to these values and principles is enshrined in the Joint Communiqué adopted by the Ministerial Meeting. The EU took positive note of the announcement, made earlier this year by the Saudi authorities, of their intention to allow Saudi women to vote and run for office at the 2015 municipal elections, together with the possibility that women sit in the Shura Council in the near future.
