Answer given by Mrs Wallström on behalf of the Commission (21 September 2007) As the Commission indicated in its reply to the Honorable Member's previous Written Question E‑4032/07 , the draft Treaty amending the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community which is currently subject to negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference (document CIG 1/07, which is available on the website of the Council of the European Union), contains a proposed new subparagraph to the current Article 19 of the Treaty on the European Union which states that ‘when the Union has defined a position on a subject which is on the United Nations Security Council agenda, those Member States which sit on the Security Council shall request that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy be asked to present the Union’s position’. It would be up to the Presidency of the Security Council to agree to such a request from Member States with a seat on the Security Council for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to present the Union’s position. However, the Commission would like to remind the Honourable Member that only States are Members of the Security Council (and indeed the United Nations) and have either a permanent or a non-permanent seat. The presentation of the Union’s position by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy under the mentioned provision would not alter the status or right to speak of Member States with a seat in the Security Council.
