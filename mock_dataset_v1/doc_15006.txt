WRITTEN QUESTION E-4988/06 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (21 November 2006) Subject: Nuclear energy The President of the European Commission has just stated, quite rightly, that using nuclear energy should not be a ‘taboo’. He even stated that Brussels could ‘give support, particularly as regards research and safety’. This is a common-sense position in that nuclear energy is a source of energy diversification, a renewable energy source and a clean form of energy. Can the Commission say how it intends to give its support to the use and production of nuclear energy?
