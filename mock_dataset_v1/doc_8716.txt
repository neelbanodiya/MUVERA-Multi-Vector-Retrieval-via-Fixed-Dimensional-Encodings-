Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (23 August 2011) Trade agreements negotiated by the Commission involve fishery and aquaculture products in different aspects, in compliance with the negotiating guidelines issued by the Council. These include the tariffs applied to EU imports and exports of fishery and aquaculture products and the rules of origin defining the country of origin of the product. In addition, the newly negotiated free trade agreements also contain a sustainable development chapter, which includes commitments with the aim of promoting the sustainable management of fisheries resources. Fisheries aspects are addressed in bilateral trade agreements concluded recently with Korea, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Central America, Colombia and Peru, and the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the Caribbean countries (CARIFORUM). The EU is currently negotiating trade agreements with India, Singapore, Malaysia, Canada, Mercosur, Ukraine as well as Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the ACP countries (West Africa, Central Africa, Eastern and Southern Africa, Eastern African Community, South African Development Community and Pacific States).
