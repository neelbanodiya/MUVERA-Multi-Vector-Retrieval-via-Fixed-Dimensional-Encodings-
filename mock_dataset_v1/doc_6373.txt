Question for written answer E-008636/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Britta Thomsen (S&D) (29 September 2011) Subject: Double taxation of pensions and freedom of movement Can it be right that a Danish national who moves to another EU Member State will be taxed both in Denmark and in her new Member State of residence on the pension she has built up in Denmark? Can the Commission confirm that this double taxation in practice constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of movement of EU citizens, and does the Commission propose to change these rules?
