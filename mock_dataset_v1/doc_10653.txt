Answer given by Mr Solbes Mira on behalf of the Commission (19 February 2003) A copy of tables compiled by the Commission is sent direct to the Honourable Member and the Secretariat General of the Parliament. These tables present the projections in the Stability or Convergence programme for each Member State, and the resulting ones for the euro area and the Union as a whole, for real gross domestic production (GDP), the budget balance and inflation. These tables also include the Autumn 2002 Commission Forecasts, which besides forecasting developments for these variables between 2002 and 2004, also reproduce the published out-turns for 2001. Out-turns for 2002 are not available in many cases yet. The out-turns for 2002 budget balances will only be available and published in the course of March 2003, following the regular notification by Member States of figures for the net borrowing requirement. The Commission does not intend for the moment to conduct an ex-post study of the differences between projections and out-turn. However, an overview of the programmes and of their assessment will be included, as in previous years, in the report Public Finances in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) , which is scheduled for publication in May 2003.
