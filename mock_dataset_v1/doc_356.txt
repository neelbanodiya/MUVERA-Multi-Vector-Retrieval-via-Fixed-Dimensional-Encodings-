Reply (27 October 2010) The right to vote and to stand as a candidate is part of the concept of European citizenship, the definition and scope of which are laid down in Article 20 TFEU. Article 20(2)(b) provides for such rights in relation to elections to the European Parliament and in municipal elections in the Member State of residence of European citizens. Article 25 TFEU requires the Commission to report to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Economic and Social Committee every three years on the application of the provisions on European citizenship. Following such a report, the Council, acting unanimously after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, may adopt provisions to strengthen or to add to the rights listed in Article 20(2).
