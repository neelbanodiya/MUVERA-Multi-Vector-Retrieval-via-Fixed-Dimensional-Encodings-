Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2005) The Commission occupies 60 buildings in Brussels and 8 in Luxemburg, with varying tenure arrangements. Two tables listing these buildings and their tenure status, contract dates and, where applicable, owner, are being sent directly to the European Parliament’s office for buildings and infrastructure. The Charlemagne building was renovated by the company Bouygues Belgium SA. The contract for a long-term lease with an option to buy was signed with Cofinimmo, a Brussels-registered company, duly entered in the trade register. The contract value of this building has been estimated at EUR 217 million. The Berlaymont building was renovated by the company Berlaymont 2000 SA, with whom the Commission has a contract for a long-term lease with an option to buy. This company is also registered in Brussels and is duly entered in the trade register. The contract value of this building was set at EUR 553 million. Various estimates carried out in 2001 and 2002 for the Commission valued the building at between EUR 480 and 700 million. Since other institutions are responsible for the other buildings mentioned, the Commission cannot address such requests for information.
