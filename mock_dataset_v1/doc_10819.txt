Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 February 2009) The Commission has indeed assessed the steps taken by the Belgian authorities so far and those that have been announced. The Commission concluded that the existing measures for protecting the harbor porpoises against being caught in gill nets used by recreational beach fishermen were insufficient and that there was not sufficient certainty that the announced measures for protecting the harbor porpoises would be adopted and implemented. Consequently, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion on 17 October 2008 based on Article 12(1)(a) of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, giving a two months deadline. The Commission did not receive a reply from the Belgian authorities within this deadline. The Commission is currently deciding on the next step to take.
