Answer given by Ms Fischer-Boel on behalf of the Commission (7 March 2006) In Directive 2003/30/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 8 May 2003 on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport OJ L 123, 17.5.2003 . , the Commission set reference values for indicative targets to be set by Member States, for the placing on their markets of biofuels, as a percentage of the petrol and diesel used for transport purposes. Member States were invited to report to the Commission, before 1 July each year, on the total sales of transport fuel and the share of biofuels placed on the market for the preceding year. No provision has been made, either in this directive or elsewhere, for Member States to submit reports on a regional basis. Therefore, the Commission is not in a position to respond to the Honourable Member’s written question.
