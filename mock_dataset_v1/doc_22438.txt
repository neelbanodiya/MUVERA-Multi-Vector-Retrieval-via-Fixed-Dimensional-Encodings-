Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (10 December 2004) The Commission is actively engaged in the revision of block exemption Regulation 1617/93 Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1617/93 of 25 June 1993 on the application of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty to certain categories of agreements and concerted practices concerning joint planning and coordination of schedules, joint operations, consultations on passenger and cargo tariffs on scheduled air services and slot allocation at airports, OJ L 155, 26.6.1993 which expires on 30 June 2005, regarding in particular the International Air Transport Association (IATA) Tariff and Airport Slot Conferences. At this stage, the Directorate-General for Competition has published a consultation paper outlining, on a preliminary basis, a tentative discussion of the said conferences under Article 81 of the EC Treaty. The consultation paper was posted on 30 June 2004 on the Commission’s website. Numerous stakeholders and public authorities submitted a response to the paper, including some consumer organisations. These submissions are published on the Internet Responses to the consultation paper are available at the following address: http://europa.eu.int/comm/competition/antitrust/others/1617/contributions.html . The Commission entirely agrees that the revision of Regulation 1617/93 should not be decided without an analysis of the possible effects which either of the options under consideration in the consultation paper may have on consumers and/or the airline industry. Hence, the Commission is presently working on a further paper to complement where appropriate the preliminary analysis set out in the consultation paper and discuss the results of the consultation process. Accordingly, the Commission regrets that it is at the present stage not yet in a position to answer fully the Honourable Member’s question.
