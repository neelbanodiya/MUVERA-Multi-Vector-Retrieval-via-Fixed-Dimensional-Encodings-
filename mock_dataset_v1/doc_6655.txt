Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (24 May 2006) The Commission closely follows the work of the International Energy Agency. The views expressed by Mr Mandil cover many of the themes discussed in the Commission’s 2006 Green Paper on Energy Policy COM(2006)105 final. . The European Union has already taken significant measures to open energy markets to competition. Among other things, the gas and electricity directives Directive 98/30/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas, OJ L 204, 21.7.1998 and Directive 96/92/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity, OJ L 27, 30.1.1997. provide for full consumer choice, separation of networks from associated production and supply businesses and for regulators in all Member States. By July 2007, all consumers will be able to choose freely between different suppliers Directive 2003/54/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC — Statements made with regard to decommissioning and waste management activities, OJ L 176, 15.7.2003 and Directive 2003/55/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC, OJ L 176, 15.7.2003. . The Commission’s 2005 report on progress in the internal electricity and gas market COM(2005)568 final. noted the progress that had been made in many Member States, especially for electricity. Competition has helped restrain electricity prices near to the levels of 1995, despite rising primary fuel prices. For gas, results are less good and prices have risen more sharply due to the link with oil. Furthermore, as has been demonstrated in the preliminary report of the Commission’s energy sector inquiry, there are several remaining barriers to competition, in particular the lack of integration of national markets, dominance of former incumbent companies at national level and lack of transparency on the market. Rising prices have led to concerns, not least for large energy consumers, and were one important reason for the Commission’s competition sector inquiry. As regards high voltage/pressure transmission networks, these must be legally separate companies from generation. This is a requirement of the gas and electricity directives. However several Member States have gone further and totally separated
