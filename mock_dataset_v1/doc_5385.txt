As part of the institutionally oriented policy, this report sets particular store by the need to draw up a green paper on the European higher education area, which, adopting a comprehensive approach, should examine and discuss the current position of universities as public institutions serving citizens. The findings will enable (regional, national, and European) public aid and support to be geared more closely to the needs of universities and to the process to be completed to bring the European higher education area into being. In addition, this report maintains that universities need to coordinate their activities more effectively in order to obtain and exchange information about common programmes and projects, types of instruction, the introduction of quality assessment systems and their outcome, and postgraduate training. The cooperation required for that purpose could be pursued within a body such as the ‘European University House’.
