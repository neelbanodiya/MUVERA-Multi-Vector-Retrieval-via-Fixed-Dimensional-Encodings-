status, G. whereas the attitude of most EU Member States to accepting Iraqi refugees has been equally restrictive, with the exception of Sweden, H. whereas, under customary international law, there is a legal obligation not to return refugees to persecution or serious harm, and to allow asylum-seekers fleeing widespread human rights abuses and generalised violence to enter the relevant country, at least temporarily, in order to be screened for refugee status, I. whereas Egypt, although not a border country, has been hosting a considerable number of refugees, and whereas Syria which hosts a high proportion of the Iraqi refugees, no longer recognises the temporary protection regime (TPR), which was implemented until now without restrictions, 1. Urges Iraq's bordering countries to abide by their legal duty immediately to admit refugees, particularly those stranded at their borders and belonging to specially targeted minorities such as stateless Palestinians or religious and ethnic minorities; 2. Welcomes the recent UNHCR appeal to mobilise additional international support in order to fund its work for uprooted Iraqis within their country and in neighbouring states and for foreign refugees in Iraq; calls on the EU and the Member States and other international donors to respond to the UNHCR Appeal in support of the programmes for Iraqi refugees and internally displaced in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey and Iran, as well as Egypt; considers it as a case of extreme emergency and urges that a significant part of the EU budget earmarked for programmes with Iraq be allocated to this aim; 3. Considers that the support of the international community is vital in easing the suffering of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) or those fleeing the country, and therefore asks the Commission and the Member States to support the UNHCR's protection efforts focused on minimum protection from detention and refoulement and non-penalisation for illegal entry; as well as access to education, adequate housing, basic health care facilities and other basic services for those inside and outside Iraq; 4. Calls on the many donor countries which have been reluctant to face up to a regional Iraqi refugee crisis to take into consideration the fact that the Iraqi authorities and the governments affected in the neighbourhood appear unable to fully cope with the crisis and to reconsider the necessity of providing financial assistance to help those host countries in order to share the burden of this
