Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (14 February 2012) 1. The International Agency on Research on Cancer proposes a hazard classification of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) and does not provide any assessment of risk. The Commission has requested a new update of the assessment of the potential health effects of EMF from the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks to be ready by the end of 2012. 2. The exposure limits proposed by Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC Council Recommendation (1999/519/EC) of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of the exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0Hz‑300 GHz). are based on the 1998 guidelines of the International Commission on Non Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). However, the scientific validity of these guidelines has been assessed periodically since then by the various competent EU scientific committees. No scientific rationale to change them has been identified so far. The Commission has launched a new assessment . 3. The Commission has sustained a major research effort since 1999 to elucidate the potential health effects of EMF and is continuing to fund research in this area (the Honourable Member is referred to the Commission’s answer to Written Question E‑005586/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB. ). 4. The EU already has a regulatory framework in place (e.g. Directives 1999/5/EC Directive 1999/5/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 1999 on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment and the mutual recognition of their conformity. and 2006/95/EC Directive 2006/95/ECof the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits. ), also applicable to mobile phones, that limits the emissions of products and equipment placed on the market. This framework includes essential requirements covering all risks arising from the use of electrical equipment to ensure the health and safety of users and the public. The harmonised standards providing presumption of conformity with these requirements follow the exposure limits laid down in Council Recommendation 1999/519/EC. Such limits are regularly reviewed by the competent EU scientific committee in order to consider the possible need for adaptations. 5. The Commission does not consider necessary to take additional measures to reduce exposures to EMF from mobile devices on the market for the time being.
