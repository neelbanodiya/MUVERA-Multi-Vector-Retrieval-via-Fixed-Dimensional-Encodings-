Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (8 June 2005) The reform of the sugar sector is needed to be more in conformity with the recent common agriculture policy (CAP) reform, be more market oriented and also to be consistent with the international trade commitments of the Community. The Commission tabled its reform ideas for the sugar sector on 14 July 2004: Accomplishing a sustainable agricultural model for Europe through the reformed CAP — sugar sector reform COM(2004)499. . This proposal includes a reform of the common market organisation for the sugar sector. However, following the decision of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Appellate Body on 28 April 2005 with regard to the EU sugar regime, which has upheld the findings of the ‘panel report’, it is necessary to integrate the results of the final verdict into the legislative proposal which is scheduled for 22 June 2005. The consequences of the sugar panel on other agricultural sectors are still to be examined. A political agreement on the sugar reform should be reached with Member States in time for the Hong Kong Ministerial Meeting of the WTO in mid-December 2005. The United Kingdom Presidency has scheduled discussions in the Council as from July and it is foreseen to reach political agreement at the November Council meeting. The current sugar regime, which is based on Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector OJ L 178, 30.6.2001 . , will expire 30 June 2006. The reformed sugar market regime should enter into force as of 1 July 2006.
