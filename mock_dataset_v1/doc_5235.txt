considers that, given the current lack of a policy formulation superstructure, the need exists for clearer information on whether the Advisory Board will prove adequate and whether it will be ready to advise effectively on the content of security research and to address operational problems relating to programmes; underlines that the European Parliament should be represented in the ESRAB by five members, including the Chairmen of the responsible Committees (the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs) or their representatives; 25.
