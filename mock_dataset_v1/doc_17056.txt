Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (23 February 2012) Directive 1999/70/EC http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:1999:175:0043:0048:EN:PDF does not require as such the conversion of fixed-term employment contracts into permanent employment. Member States need to take measures imposing one of the following types of limits: (a) objective reasons justifying renewal; (b) a limit on the total duration of successive fixed-term employment contracts/relationships; (c) a limit on the number of renewals. Nothing is laid down as to what must happen when such limits are reached. Some Member States have imposed a conversion into permanent employment, others have chosen not to. In the public sector, instead of a conversion into permanent employment, Greece uses as means to prevent abusive successions of fixed term contracts a combination of all three of the abovementioned options. In a series of rulings Most recently in Case C‑3/10 — Affatato . , the Court has accepted as lawful that some Member States prohibit the conversion of fixed-term employment in the public sector, for example when this could be used to bypass the normal recruitment competitions. It has, however, insisted that in such cases, another measure (other than conversion into permanent employment) is effectively available. In this context the Court has mentioned the example of a right to compensation. The directive explicitly requires Member States to determine how much time must elapse between contracts so that they are not considered ‘successive’. Greece has set this period at three months, which the Court See the ruling in Joined Cases C-378/07 to C-380/07 — Angelidaki. considered to be acceptable in principle, subject to the national authorities to verify that in an individual case there is no abuse of such rules. It is therefore for national authorities, including the courts, to verify whether these requirements are respected.
