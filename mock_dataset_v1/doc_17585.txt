Haug SHORT JUSTIFICATION General background The Commission adopted the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) for 2006 on 27 April 2005 - the last budget under the current Financial Perspectives. The proposed appropriations total € 121.27bn in commitments (+4% to 2005) and € 112.6 billion in payments (+6% to 2005). Payments represent 1.02% of Community GNI and thus leave a considerable margin (6.7bn) under the ceiling of the Financial Perspective. The PDB allocates resources to the implementation of the Lisbon agenda (such as research, education, TENs), enhancing security (such as fight against terrorism, combating drug trafficking, maintaining food safety), strengthening solidarity (such as encouraging economic and social cohesion, environmental protection) and integrating the ten most recent Member States into key policy areas, namely the common agricultural policy and the structural and cohesion funds. More resources will be made available also for the external dimension of the key priorities.
