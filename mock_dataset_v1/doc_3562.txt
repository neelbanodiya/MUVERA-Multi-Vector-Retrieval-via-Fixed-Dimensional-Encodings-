WRITTEN QUESTION P-3774/05 by David Martin (PSE) to the Commission (12 October 2005) Subject: Customs duty and Set-Top Boxes Under current WTO rules, set-top boxes (STBs) are exempt from tariff duty when imported from outside the EU. According to code 8528 1291, apparatus with a microprocessor-based device incorporating a modem for gaining access to the Internet, having a function of interactive information exchange and being capable of receiving television signals (e.g. STBs with a communication function) are exempt from duty (the rate of which is 14 %). Given the basic difficulties involved in displaying Internet services on a TV, can the Commission confirm that the exemption will continue to apply to all STBs and not just those giving access the world wide web? Does not the Commission agree that digital TV STBs with a modem can give access to a considerable range of information society services and that this is in line with the Lisbon Agenda, which acknowledges that the Internet comprises a spectrum of services, from the world wide web accessible with a PC to WAP sites accessible with mobile phones, as well as what is known as the ‘walled garden’ of services accessible via digital TV STBs which have a modem? Can the Commission clarify the position of its Customs Code Committee on this matter?
