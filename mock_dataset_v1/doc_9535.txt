Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (20 November 2007) The Commission can confirm receipt of nine applications in respect of meat-based products from the Slovak Republic and three from Poland for registration as guaranteed traditional specialities. The Commission is required to scrutinize the applications received as stipulated in Article 8(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 of 20 March 2006 on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed, OJ L 93, 31.3.2006. . If the Commission considers that an application is justified and meets the conditions laid down in the said regulation, it publishes in the Official Journal of the EU the name and address of the applicant group, the product specification and the name and address of the authorities or bodies verifying compliance with the provisions of the specification, and their specific tasks. Article 9(1) of the regulation provides inter alia that within six months from the date of the abovementioned publication any Member State may object to the registration by lodging a duly substantiated statement with the Commission. Article 9(2) provides that such objections may include statements from individuals or companies from outside the Member State which made the request, provided that these persons have a legitimate interest. It is also possible for persons from third countries to object. In this way, the concerns of producers in other Member States (or third countries) can be taken into account.
