Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (9 March 2012) In the conclusions on the EU‑Turkey Readmission Agreement and related issues, adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council on 24 and 25 February 2011, the Commission, the Member States and Turkey are invited to intensify their cooperation on visa issues, ensuring harmonised implementation of practical improvements for Turkish visa applicants within the framework of the EU Visa Code. In order to implement these conclusions, the Commission and the Member States have taken steps to use the existing flexibilities available under the acquis. As a first result, the Commission has adopted a harmonised list of documents required from Turkish applicants by all the Schengen Member States. Additional measures were proposed to the Member States by the Commission, including through a letter which was jointly sent to their Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of the Interior by the Commissioner responsible for Home Affairs and the Commissioner responsible for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy on 16 November 2011. Several Member States responded positively to this proposal. In the above conclusions, the Council also takes note of the Commission's intention to initiate a dialogue on visa, mobility and migration with Turkey. The Commission has already proposed to start such a dialogue to the Turkish authorities. In its conclusions of 5 December 2011, the Council took note positively of the Commission's proposal for a positive agenda with Turkey, supporting the negotiating process. Visas are among the areas of common interest that will be covered by this positive agenda.
