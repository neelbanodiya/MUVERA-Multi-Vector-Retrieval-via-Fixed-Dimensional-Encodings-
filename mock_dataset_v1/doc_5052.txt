Answer given by Ms Hedegaard on behalf of the Commission (13 August 2010) Article 6 of the Directive 1999/94/EC Directive 1999/94/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 relating to the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO 2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars, OJ L 12, 18.1.2000, last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1137/2008 of the Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008, OJ L 311, 21.11.2008. on the availability of consumer information on fuel economy and CO 2 emissions in respect of the marketing of new passenger cars provides that ‘the Member States shall ensure that all promotional literature contains the official fuel consumption data of the passenger car models to which it refers in accordance with the requirements of Annex IV’. Consequently, monitoring compliance with the legislation is primarily a Member State competence. The Commission maintains a general supervisory overview, in order to ensure that the rules are applied within the Member States. Greece transposed the directive correctly and so far no formal complaints have been submitted to the Commission regarding its implementation or enforcement. The present directive contains no obligations for Member States to report regularly on the implementation of the directive, although such information might be helpful in supervising its correct application. This is but one example of a potential improvement of the directive. As announced in the communication on a ‘European strategy on clean and energy efficient vehicles’ COM(2010)186 final. , the Commission will present a proposal for revising the Directive 1999/94/EC.
