Calls on the Commission and the Members States to make progress in this area by supporting the establishment of accounting standards for disclosure requirements in respect of external assistance and by working with civil society organisations, national parliaments, local authorities and international organisations to set out good practice in recording aid flows in national budgets; 38. Urges the Commission and the Member States to align their aid to the country systems by using general and sectoral budget support, which has to be based on a solid poverty reduction plan that strengthens domestic accountability and which has to be linked to the shared commitment on reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs, on respecting human rights and on strengthening and improving monitoring, financial management and accountability; 39. Stresses the need for incremental and predictable funding from the Commission and the Members States, in the form of multi-year (3 years or more) aid commitments, which are based on clear and transparent criteria and poverty eradication outcomes including specific sectoral outcomes, agreed with partner countries, and which are delivered on schedule, in a transparent manner so as to allow investment in building the human resources so vital for improving aid effectiveness; welcomes the initiative of MDG contracting to ensure a more predictable form of budget support in the longer term; insists however that this involves a strong commitment to achieving the MDGs by partner countries and that continuous monitoring with a strong focus on results is needed; welcomes the MDG contract as one of the possible ways to increase the predictability of aid; 40. Notes that, in most developing countries, most of the MDG targets will not be met by 2015; and urges Member States to prepare annual timetables to meet the promises they have made; 41. Recognises the importance of setting targets in order to achieve gradually a situation in which 100% of technical assistance is demand-driven and aligned to partners' national strategies; 42. Stresses that technical assistance planned in the light of the needs expressed by recipient countries and civil society organisations rather than the priorities of donor countries should make it possible to increase both the capacities of the EU's partners and local appropriation; 43. Notes that aid reform is only one of the steps that the EU must take along with making its trade, security, migration, agriculture, fisheries, energy, environment, climate change and other policies coherent with development objectives in
