Question for written answer E-005232/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Paweł Zalewski (PPE) (27 May 2011) Subject: Internal bilateral investment agreements In recent months, the European Parliament, especially the Committee on International Trade at committee stage, addressed the very complex issue of the regulation on bilateral investment agreements (BITs) with third countries. Now, I would like to address the parallel issue of internal, intra-union bilateral agreements between the 27 Member States of the EU. According to the Treaties, their existence is in contradiction to the underlying principles of the EU single market and equal conditions of investment for all investors from all 27 Member States. Having regard to this, when does the Commission propose to affirm that currently existing internal BITs are invalid in the light of EC law, and in what form does the Commission plan to take the legal steps leading to the abolition of all internal BITs?
