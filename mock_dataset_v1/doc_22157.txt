Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (2 September 2011) Transparency of budgetary operations has always been considered a prerequisite for sound public finances. It ensures that decision-makers are accountable to taxpayers at the various stages of the budget process, from preparation to adoption and most importantly, implementation. The draft EU directive on budgetary frameworks, part of the Commission economic governance package unveiled in September 2010, establishes a set of minimum requirements. Specifically, the draft directive puts forward several provisions for enhanced transparency of budgetary operations, including the need for public methodologies, timely statistics and well-explained forecasts. According to the draft directive Member States would have to identify and present properly all relevant extra-budgetary funds in the framework of the annual budgetary process. Member States would also have to publish detailed information on the impact of tax expenditures on revenues. Finally, Member States would have to publish relevant information on contingent liabilities with potentially large impacts on public budgets, including government guarantees, non-performing loans, and liabilities stemming from the operation of public corporations. These principles altogether, to be transposed into national law by the end of 2013, would effectively support the implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact.
