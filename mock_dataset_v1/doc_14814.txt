Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (27 June 2011) The EU framework for electronic communications, in particular the Universal Service Directive Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services, as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC. , requires providers of electronic communications networks and/or services, such as for example those delivering Internet access, to provide consumers with transparent, comparable, adequate and up-to-date information on the services offered. This should in turn enable consumers to make informed choices about their communications providers. The revised Universal Service Directive, which was to be implemented by Member States by 25 May 2011, further strengthens transparency requirements to the benefit of consumers. In particular, under Article of 21 of the directive, national regulators should ensure the publication of transparent, comparable, adequate and up to date information on tariffs and other terms and conditions of providers. Although the Commission monitors implementation at national level, it is up to the national regulatory authorities (NRAs) to make sure these provisions are effectively implemented and to take corrective action if appropriate. The Commission together with the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) is looking into issues of transparency, switching barriers and traffic management. It will report on its findings by the end of the year.
