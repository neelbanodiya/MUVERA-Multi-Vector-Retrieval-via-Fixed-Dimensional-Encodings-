Question for written answer E-8870/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Borghezio (EFD) (28 October 2010) Subject: Meeting behind closed doors with European freemasons On Friday, 15 and Saturday, 16 October, on Parliament's premises, the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, and the President of Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, held a meeting with representatives of freemasonry in Europe. This meeting took place behind closed doors, in such a fashion that not even Parliament's officials were allowed any access to it. Does the Commission not believe that the secrecy surrounding this meeting is in contradiction of the principles of transparency which should characterise the EU institutions?
