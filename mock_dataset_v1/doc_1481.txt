{ "context": [ [ "TMA-3 mine", [ "The TMA-3 is a circular Yugoslavian minimum metal anti-tank blast mine.", " It is very similar in appearance to the TMA-4.", " The mine consists of a cast circular block of explosive cased in resin reinforced fabric.", " The top of the mine has three fuze wells which each take a UTMA-3 fuze, and a fourth secondary fuze well is provided in the base of the mine to fit an anti-handling device.", " The fuze wells may also accept a number of other fuzes, including the UPROM-1, and other fuzes, potentially allowing tripwire activation.", " The small pressure plate area of the UTMA-3 fuzes gives the mine good resistance to minefield clearance techniques which used blast overpressure techniques i.e. explosive charges." ] ], [ "Pyrotechnic fastener", [ "A pyrotechnic fastener (also called an explosive bolt, or pyro, within context) is a fastener, usually a nut or bolt, that incorporates a pyrotechnic charge that can be initiated remotely.", " One or more explosive charges embedded within the bolt are typically activated by an electric current, and the charge breaks the bolt into two or more pieces.", " The bolt is typically scored around its circumference at the point(s) where the severance should occur.", " Such bolts are often used in space applications to ensure separation between rocket stages, because they are lighter and much more reliable than mechanical latches." ] ], [ "Bangalore torpedo", [ "A Bangalore torpedo is an explosive charge placed within one or several connected tubes.", " It is used by combat engineers to clear obstacles that would otherwise require them to approach directly, possibly under fire.", " It is sometimes colloquially referred to as a \"Bangalore mine\", \"banger\" or simply \"Bangalore\"." ] ], [ "Depth charge", [ "A depth charge is an anti-submarine warfare weapon.", " It is intended to destroy a submarine by being dropped into the water nearby and detonating, subjecting the target to a powerful and destructive hydraulic shock.", " Most depth charges use high explosive charges and a fuze set to detonate the charge, typically at a specific depth.", " Depth charges can be dropped by ships, patrol aircraft, and helicopters." ] ], [ "Mine-clearing line charge", [ "A mine-clearing line charge (abbreviated MICLIC and pronounced or \"\"mick-lick\"\") is used to create a breach in minefields under combat conditions.", " While there are many types, the
