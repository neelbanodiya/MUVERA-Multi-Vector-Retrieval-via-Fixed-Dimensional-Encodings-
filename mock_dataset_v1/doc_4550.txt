WRITTEN QUESTION E-3427/06 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (25 July 2006) Subject: Anti-terrorist measures in India The terrorist attacks in Mumbai (India), which hit mainline and underground railway stations, left 160 people dead and more than 500 injured, according to what are still unfortunately provisional figures. These tragic events caused by terrorism have also hit one of the most developed Asian countries, and it is thought that those responsible may be Muslim separatists from Kashmir, linked to ‘Lashkar-i-Taiba’, the Islamic terrorist group generally considered to be the armed wing of Osama Bin Laden in Asia. Given that relations between the European Union and India began in the 1960s and that cooperation goes well beyond trade and economic activity, since political dialogue has intensified over the last decade, 1. Does the Commission not consider that it should immediately offer to open discussions with India in order to seek jointly to combat such forms of terrorism, which are still causing bloodshed in the Asian region? 2. Does it not consider it necessary to step up political dialogue with India and neighbouring countries to ensure that the efforts of the Indian Government to democratise its institutions are not in vain? 3. Does it not consider, in the light of this latest terrorist attack of 11 July (a clear reference to the two other attacks of 11 September in New York and of 11 March in Madrid), that new forms of war on terrorism should be introduced, that are more global and synergy-based than hitherto, requiring closer cooperation with the security forces and intelligence services of the governments of all countries prepared to sign a joint treaty on the global war on terrorism, to be implemented in all the signatory countries?
