WRITTEN QUESTION E-2047/05 by Caroline Jackson (PPE-DE) to the Commission (7 June 2005) Subject: Exemption of risk-assessed flame retardant from EU Directive on electronics and hazardous substances Directive 2002/95/EC OJ L 37, 13.2.2003, p. 19 . on the restriction of certain hazardous substances (RoHS) in electrical and electronic equipment requires the Commission to evaluate ‘as a matter of priority’ the flame retardant Deca BDE. Deca BDE is an important flame retardant for plastics and textiles. It is the major flame retardant used to meet the 1988 UK and Irish furniture fire safety regulations which, according to a UK Government report, has led to over 700 lives saved and nearly 6000 serious injuries prevented. The Commission has recently submitted a proposal under the comitology procedure as foreseen under the Directive’s Article 7(2) to exempt Deca BDE from the RoHS Directive. What is the scientific basis for the proposal to exempt Deca BDE from the RoHS Directive? Was Deca BDE subject to a stakeholder consultation as required by Article 5(2) of the aforesaid Directive? Given that there are alternatives to Deca BDE in some of its uses, to what extent does the Commission view a restriction of Deca BDE as likely to result in greater negative environmental, health and/or consumer safety impacts as per Article 5(1)(b)? Will the exemption be subject to review in line with the RoHS Directive’s requirements under Article 5(1)(c)?
