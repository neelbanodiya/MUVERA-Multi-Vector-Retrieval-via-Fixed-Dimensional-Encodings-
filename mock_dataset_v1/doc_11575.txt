ORAL QUESTION H-0202/04 for Question Time at the part-session in April 2004 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by María Izquierdo Rojo to the Council Subject: Assault and destruction along the pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela following the resumption of work halted at the European Parliament's request Following the European Parliament's approval of its resolution B4-1072/96 on support for conservation of the pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela (one of the treasures of Europe's cultural heritage), the Spanish Government halted work on the N-550 trunk road at the point where it passes through Pazos (Galicia). The work remained at a standstill during the intervening eight years but it has now been resumed; indeed, following the 14 March elections it is now proceeding at a faster rate than ever. It is both inconsistent and paradoxical that the work should be being financed by means of the ERDF. Since the possibility of assault and destruction which originally prompted the European Parliament to object to the work is still just as strong, does the Council not think that the current resumption of work is likely to imperil the Santiago de Compostela pilgrim route yet again?
