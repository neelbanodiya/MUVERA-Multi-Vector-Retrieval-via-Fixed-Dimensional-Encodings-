ORAL QUESTION H-0219/03 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Michl Ebner to the Commission Subject: Drinking water in developing countries and industrialised countries Many countries, particularly developing countries, have no safe water supply. Very often this is the cause of a variety of diseases and of the high infant mortality rate in third world countries. What development aid measures is the European Commission taking in order to provide people in third world countries with access to clean drinking water? The drinking water problem is now affecting the industrialised countries as well, however. In these countries people must be made aware of the need to save precious drinking water resources. What steps is the European Commission taking in this area? What steps has it already taken?
