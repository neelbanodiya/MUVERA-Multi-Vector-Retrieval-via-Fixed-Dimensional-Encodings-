Question for written answer E-5929/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 George Lyon (ALDE) (26 July 2010) Subject: GMO cultivation: new approach to authorisation Following the recent Commission proposals on a new approach to GMO cultivation authorisation in the EU, which proposes to grant Member States the final decision on GMO cultivation [COM(2010)380, COM(2010)375, and COM(2010)4822], 1. Would the Commission outline what is the expected impact on the proper functioning of the Single Market for genetically modified products planted in the EU territory, if some Member States were to authorise their cultivation, and others were to decide to ban such practices on their respective national territories? 2. Would the Commission agree that a situation might arise where some difficult issues could be at stake in terms of intra-EU trade and the free movement of goods across the EU, following its new proposed approach? 3. Would the Commission ultimately consider an EU‑wide authorisation plan for GMO cultivation as being the best possible option for the Single Market and for trade, including opportunities with the rest of the world, while providing answers to the question of co‑existence to let producers who wish to produce GM-free freely do so?
