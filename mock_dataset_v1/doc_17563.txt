again and increase to a level of EUR 500 million compared to EUR 490 million this year. The Emergency aid reserve under heading 6 of the financial perspective is endowed with EUR 229 million in addition to this. Heading 5 - Aspects related to the Commission Human resources and other administrative expenditure 20. As a result of the lower than expected salary adjustment in 2004 and technical adjustment of the ceiling for 2006, the overall margin in heading 5 at this stage of the budgetary procedure is expected to amount to around EUR 15 million. This is a positive development compared to the March 2004 report where the Secretaries-General of the institutions then estimated that there would be negative margin in 2006 of some EUR – 4,5 million. 21. In the PDB for 2006, the Commission administrative expenditure is proposed to be increased by EUR 191 million (6%) 2005 budget to EUR 3.296 billion. This comparison is made taking into account AB 1/2005 and preliminary AB 2/2005 (salaries adjustments) which, however, has not yet been adopted and on which there are, at the moment, some doubts in the Council precisely concerning the Commission expenditure. 22. The increase in appropriations is due to the increase in salary expenditure relating to enlargement posts, rents and social expenditures, especially childcare facilities. Appropriations for subsidies (ex A-30 grants) under heading 5 are reduced compared to 2005, as the reference amounts set a limit for the possible remaining expenditure. The rapporteur will present a specific working document on this section. 23. Following its multi-annual plan on enlargement needs, the Commission is requesting 700 new posts in 2006, on top of the 700 posts allocated in 2005 and 780 in 2004. Out of the 700 new posts, 685 are for the operating establishment plan of the Commission and 15 for the Commission Offices. A strong emphasis in allocating the new posts is given to languages services and internal policies. 24. The Commission also requests 100 external staff in view of the enlargement to Romania and Bulgaria. These resources, mainly contract staff and seconded national experts, would be allocated mainly to translation and Publications Office (acquis in the new languages). Heading 6 - reserves 25. This heading includes two reserves to be called on during the year, if needed, following proposals by the Commission (both these reserves are fixed in the IIA to 200 million in 1999
