where the compensation rules would not apply: extreme tidal conditions, strong winds, significant wave heights and formation of ice. Rights of people with disabilities or reduced mobility People with reduced mobility may not be refused the right to board a ship, bus or coach except where their safety would be endangered. MEPs ensured that the disability of a passenger cannot be used as a reason for denying them the right to board. Free assistance must be given to disabled people in ports but operators must be informed at the time the reservation is made or at least 48 hours in advance. The staff of a maritime transport company must receive adequate information in order to be able to provide assistance. MEPs added a clause requiring companies to provide passengers with written confirmation of the assistance that will be provided. Coaches: only national and international transport MEPs agreed that Member States should be allowed to exclude bus and coach transport in urban, suburban and regional areas from the regulation's scope, reflecting the particular nature of such services. However, special measures to guarantee passengers' rights on these services must be taken by individual Member States.
