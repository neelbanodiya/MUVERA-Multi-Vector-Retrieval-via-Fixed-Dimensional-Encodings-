ORAL QUESTION H-0149/07/rev.1 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Johan Van Hecke to the Council Subject: Arresting LRA leaders The Government of Uganda has for some considerable time been engaged in talks with the LRA, a movement which for years has terrorised people in Northern Uganda and which abuses children in an appalling manner. On 26 August 2006, the two parties signed a ceasefire agreement, which expired at the end of February. The LRA did not go to the agreed assembly points but is making for the Central African Republic. The ICC has issued an international arrest warrant for LRA leader Kony and four other commanders. What steps will the Council take to induce the Governments of the DRC and the Central African Republic to arrest the LRA leaders?
