WRITTEN QUESTION E-2994/07 by Dan Jørgensen (PSE) to the Commission (14 June 2007) Subject: Utilisation or disposal of discarded wind turbine blades Wind energy like other sustainable energy is a central and significant component of the Community's energy and industrial policy. When wind turbine blades are no longer in use they must either be disposed of or recycled and it is precisely the problems of disposal in connection with composite waste (reinforced epoxy and polyester plastic) that are seen by many investors as the principal problem with this form of energy. It is a well-known fact that fibre glass can be used as packing material after crushing and separation into glass and binding agent respectively, but this separation process is expensive, laborious and energy-intensive. Nearly all fibre glass waste therefore goes to landfill and, since this waste is not biodegradable, it will accumulate and pose problems for future generations. According to reports from the Danish authorities, up to 80 % of this waste goes to landfill and it is estimated that the figures for the total quantities of waste from discarded composite products are 1700 - 6400 tonnes in 2000, 2900 - 10100 tonnes in 2010 and 5700 - 15300 tonnes in 2020 http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publikationer/2002/87-7944-963-8/pdf/87-7944-964-6.pdf . In the light of Commission policy more generally and of Community law in the waste sector, it seems evident that it is preferable for products (discarded wind turbine blades or other fibre glass products) to be recycled and converted into new products rather than being incinerated and going to landfill. Can the Commission confirm that it will — if technically possible — ensure that products are recycled rather than being incinerated or sent to landfill? Is it aware of the opportunities available for using fibre glass waste for the manufacture of load-bearing beams as patented in Denmark? See description of patent at following website: http://onlineweb.dkpto.dk/pvsonline/Patent?action=104&sagID=PA%202002%2001794 Furthermore, does it intend — and, if so, how — to support such initiatives and technologies that can resolve the problems of disposal and thereby remedy the problems with non-biodegradable composite waste?
