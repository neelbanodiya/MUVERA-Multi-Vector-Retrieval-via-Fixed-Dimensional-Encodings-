Question for written answer E-003044/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (30 March 2011) Subject: Inadequate housing for Roma families in Romania In June 2004, around 100 Roma, including families with young children, were forcibly evicted by municipal authorities from a crumbling building on Pictor Nagy Imre Str. in Miercurea Ciuc http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/EUR39/005/2010/en/f2f2b1d2-bd54-4a80-9aac- fa8b9a1a2070/eur390052010en.pdf . Around 75 Romani people were moved to the outskirts of the city next to a sewage treatment plant, where they have been living in 8 metal cabins and 14 self-constructed shacks in an area deemed unfit for human habitation. In 2001, the authorities told the residents of the building they had to move for their own safety. There was no genuine consultation with them and they were not given sufficient information or the opportunity to suggest alternative solutions. Residents claim the authorities assured them that the metal cabins provided were temporary and that proper housing would be made available in due course. Temporary contracts for the metal cabins were only assigned to those previously legally residing in the building. Others were forced to build makeshift shacks and may face a forcible eviction again. The metal cabins are overcrowded and the sanitation facilities are inadequate. There is no adequate protection from damp, heat, rain and wind. In winter, the temperature can fall below -25ºC. Those living next to the city’s sewage plant endure an unpleasant smell of human excrement. A sign on the plant’s fence warns about ‘toxic danger’. Seven years later, and after various court cases, the communities are still unable to enjoy their right to adequate housing. The Commission is asked the following: 1. Is the above housing situation compatible with basic housing rights, as referred to in Article 34 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights? 2. Does the Commission consider this situation to be a satisfactory application of Article 31 of the Council of Europe’s revised Social Charter/RESC? 3. Is keeping people in a highly inappropriate temporary shelter for such a long time, as practised by the national authorities, compatible with the guidelines set out in EP Written Declaration 61/2010 on homelessness? 4. What measures will the Commission take to ensure full enjoyment of housing rights?
