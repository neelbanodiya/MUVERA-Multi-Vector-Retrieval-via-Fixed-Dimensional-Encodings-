Rotary evaporator 4.4. Preparation of extract and separation of anionic active agents 4.4.1. Preparation of extract The quantity of surfactants necessary for the biodegradation test is about 50 g MBAS. Normally, the quantity of product to be extracted will not exceed 1 000 g, but it may be necessary to extract further quantities of sample. For practical reasons, the quantity of product used should in most cases be limited to 5 000 g in preparing extracts for the biodegradation test. Experience has shown that there are advantages in using a number of small extractions rather than one large extraction. The exchanger quantities specified are designed for a working capacity of 600-700 mmoles of surfactants and soap. 4.4.2. Isolation of alcohol-soluble constituents Add 250 g of the synthetic detergent to be analysed to 1 250 ml ethanol, heat the mixture to boiling point and reflux for one hour with stirring. Pass the hot alcoholic solution through a coarse-pored suction filter heated to 50 °C and filter rapidly. Wash the flask and suction filter with approximately 200 ml hot ethanol. Collect the filtrate and
