ORAL QUESTION H-0592/03 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Marit Paulsen to the Commission Subject: Russian oil drilling in the Baltic Sea Towards the end of this year, a Russian oil firm will be starting to extract oil, barely 20 km from the Curonian peninsula on the Lithuanian coast. It seems that neither the firm nor the Russian authorities have been willing to publish the results of any investigations or environmental impact assessments which may have been carried out. Not only the unique Curonian peninsula – which has been included on UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites – but also half of the Lithuanian coast and the extremely sensitive Baltic Sea would be seriously affected in the event of a major oil spill. That being the case, has the Commission made any contacts with the Russian authorities regarding safety arrangements and plans for safety measures which Russia proposes to take in the event of an accident? If so, what was the result of such contacts? If not, does the Commission propose to make contact with the Russian authorities in order to clarify this matter?
