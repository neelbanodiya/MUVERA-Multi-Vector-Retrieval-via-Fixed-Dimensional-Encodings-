Reply (4 May 2009) The Council recalls the European Council conclusions of December 2005 and of June 2008. The decision by the European Council in December 2005 to grant candidate-country status to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was taken in line with the normal procedures, and in particular in light of the opinion from the Commission on the application by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for EU membership. The Council has not taken any decision to open accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Any such decision would be taken in line with the normal procedures. It would not be appropriate for the Council to speculate on the timing of any such decision, nor on any decisions relating to other possible accession negotiations.
