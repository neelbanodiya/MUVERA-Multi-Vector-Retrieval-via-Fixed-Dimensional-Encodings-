Reply (7 March 2011) With regard to the functioning of the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons between the EU and the Swiss Confederation and EU‑Swiss relations in general, the Council draws the attention of the Honourable Member to the Council conclusions of 14 December 2010 on EU relations with EFTA States See doc. 17423/1/10. . Concerning the application of the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons, the Council stated in paragraph 43 of its conclusions that it was concerned about the inconsistent application of certain agreements and the introduction by Switzerland of subsequent legislative measures and practices incompatible with those agreements, in particular the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons, and it called upon Switzerland to abrogate such restrictions (for instance, the obligation in force in Switzerland to provide prior notification with an 8-day waiting period) and to refrain from adopting new measures incompatible with the Agreement. Regarding subjects such as non-discrimination and worker's rights, specific issues of concern to the EU and its Member States are regularly raised in the Joint Committee, created under Article 14 of the Agreement and responsible for the management and proper application of the Agreement. The EU is represented in this Joint Committee by the Commission. The Council will continue to follow closely the proceedings of the Joint Committee and to raise issues of particular concern in high-level contacts with representatives of the Swiss Government, as appropriate.
