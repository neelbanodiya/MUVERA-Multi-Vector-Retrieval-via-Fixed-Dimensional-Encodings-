Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (23 June 2006) In its judgment on tourist guides in 1991 (C-180/89), the European Court of Justice ruled that Article 49 of the EC Treaty, on the freedom to provide services, does not permit Member States to require guides accompanying tourist groups to obtain a specific national qualification. However, the Court set out an exception covering ‘museums or historical monuments suitable for visiting only if accompanied by a professional and specialist guide’. In order to assess whether the case reported could benefit from this exemption, the Commission would need more information on the circumstances of the arrest, in particular on the monuments which were visited. Upon receipt of this information, the Commission will contact the Slovakian authorities. In its request, it will also inquire about the list of sites and monuments subject to the qualification requirement, and on its enforcement. Moreover, Directive 2005/36/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 OJ L 255, 30.9.2005 . on the recognition of professional qualifications will help to overcome these difficulties in the future. Under this new directive, which has to be implemented into national law by 20 October 2007 at the latest, Member States shall not restrict, for any reason relating to professional qualifications, the free provision of services in another Member State if the service provider is legally established in another Member State for the purpose of pursuing the same profession. Therefore, a qualified tourist guide legally established in another Member State will be entitled to provide services in Slovakia without being subject to any authorisation scheme. The current problems of foreign tourist guides in Slovakia will hence be resolved once Directive 2005/36/EC becomes applicable.
