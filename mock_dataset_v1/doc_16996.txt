Answer given by Mr Verheugen on behalf of the Commission (10 February 2005) The Commission is aware of the difficult situation of the European automobile industry. It has recently published an in-depth analysis of the sector in the framework of the European Competitiveness Report 2004 SEC (2004) 1397 . The Commission acknowledges the important contribution that the European automobile industry can make with a view to revitalizing the Lisbon agenda. The Vice-President in charge of Enterprise and Industry, therefore, announced on 13 January 2005 the setting up of a high level group for a Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st Century (CARS 21). The group will consist of prominent representatives of the EU car sector, Member States, the Parliament, trade unions, non-governmental organisations, users and the Commission. It will in particular be invited to: — develop an integrated strategy for a sustainable development of the industry; — define the best possible regulatory approaches; and — set out the necessary conditions to ensure that innovation efforts give the European industry a first mover advantage. The group is to deliver its recommendations before the end of 2005. The Commission will then follow this up with proposals for concrete actions for a competitive automotive industry.
