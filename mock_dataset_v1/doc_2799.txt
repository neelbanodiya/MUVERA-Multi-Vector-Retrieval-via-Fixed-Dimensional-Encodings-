Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2005) The situation of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay remains an issue of serious concern. The EU has underlined that anti-terrorist measures must be consistent with the unconditional prohibition of all forms of torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. International humanitarian law standards should also be upheld. It is indeed vital that the international community strives to assert full adherence to international law, including human rights and humanitarian standards, in relation to alleged Taliban and Al-Qaida members, be they held in Guantanamo or elsewhere. In the Commission’s view, the Geneva Conventions do apply to persons held in Guantanamo. The EU, as well as individual Member States have repeatedly voiced their serious concern to the United States regarding the treatment of the detainees in Guantanamo. They have in particular conveyed their expectation that the United States would respect internationally accepted standards of a fair trial.
