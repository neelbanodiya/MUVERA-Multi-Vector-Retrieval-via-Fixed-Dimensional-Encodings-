Answer given by Mrs Hûbner on behalf of the Commission (14 December 2006) Reductions of Community contributions to the Greek Third Community support framework (CSF) can only result from the application of the automatic de‑commitment (‘n+2’) rule. So far, any losses of Community funds to Greece as a consequence of automatic de-commitment have been very limited, of the order EUR 5 million (all Structural Funds contributing to the third CSF taken together). As the Commission has already stated in its answers to Written Questions E‑3222/05 and E‑4000/05 by the Honourable Member, clarifications on statements made and expressions used by members of the Greek Government should be requested from the Greek Government. Concerning responsibilities for a potential loss of funds, the Honourable Member is referred to the answers the Commission has given to Written Questions E‑3401/06 , E‑3405/06 , E‑4656/06 and E‑4750/05 by the Honourable Member. The third CSF is a strategic programming document, which was submitted at the start of the programming period in 2000 by the Greek authorities and approved by the Commission in 2001. It was revised in 2004, in the context of the mid‑term review, and again in 2005. It can be properly understood only if considered in combination with the operational programmes and programme complements, in which the strategy outlined in the third CSF is put into operation by way of priorities, measures and projects.
