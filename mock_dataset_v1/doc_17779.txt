WRITTEN QUESTION E-3130/06 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (10 July 2006) Subject: Motorcycle fuel efficiency The EU Working Group under the EU Joint Expert Group on Transport and Environment produced a report on the reduction of energy use in transport in January 2006. The report makes a number of suggestions with the aim of increasing technical efficiency in motorbikes, including for example limiting motorcycles to a one-cylinder engine (to harmonise air-fuel ratio) with a maximum 650 cm³ capacity, as well as automatic transmission for all motorcycles. However, this would seem to raise a number of problems. Firstly, single-cylinder units were traditionally regarded as having economical fuel consumption but this was due to a long stroke and a heavy flywheel which had the effect of reducing their throttle response. As well as the reduction of efficiency through increased weight from heavy flywheels and large pistons, air is often trapped in a single's crank cases requiring a breather system and more energy losses. Secondly, automatic transmission is generally less efficient than conventional gears and chain drive and remains less efficient, while poor gear selection is transient. Manual transmission is very efficient using the positive stop gear change mechanism. Lastly, the issue in relation to fuel consumption is one of power and how that power is delivered rather than capacity, with basic 1000 cc to 1200 cc machines with relatively modest power outputs often returning better fuel consumption than highly-tuned 600 cc sports motorcycles. Does the European Commission agree that these proposed suggestions have not been subject to the required level of technical expertise? Does the Commission intend to pursue any of the proposed suggestions outlined in this report by bringing forward new legislation? What action is the Commission taking to address the real issue of transport needs?
