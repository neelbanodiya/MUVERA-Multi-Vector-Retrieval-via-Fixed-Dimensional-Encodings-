Question for written answer E-000111/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (16 January 2012) Subject: Abolition of nationalities for the Albanian State The Constitutional Court of Albania has decided to abolish the term ‘nationality’ from certificates of civil status and other official documents containing personal data, prompting fears for the integrity of the country’s Greek minority. Under this decision, the provisions of the 2009 law on Civil Status are not in line with articles of the Albanian Constitution. In particular, Article 20 stipulates that ‘people from ethnic minorities are allowed to express freely, without being prevented from doing so or being obliged to do so, their ethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic identity’. Furthermore, Article 35 refers to the obligation to protect personal data. With this decision, Albanian, Greek or any other ethnic background will not be recorded in official documents which will prohibit any claim for recognition of ethnic minority. The political significance of this decision is demonstrated in the statement made by the president of the Albanian nationalist organisation, the Red and Black Alliance, Kreshnik Spahiu: ‘From now on, whoever lives in Albania must live as an Albanian.’ It is understood that the legal protection of minorities is by no means certain as a result of the prevailing nationalism which aims to establish a pure, homogenous State. According to a joint written declaration by the Greek members of the Albanian Parliament, Kostas Barkas and Vangelis Tavos, the contested decision of the Constitutional Court ‘undermines the integrity of the ethnic Greek minority and encourages nationalist and anti-European tendencies in Albania’. Considering that Albania, in the long-term, wants to become a member of the EU, whose treaties guarantee the protection of ethnic minorities and diversity in general, will the Commission say: Whether it considers that this decision goes against Albania's declared desire for EU accession and directly contravenes the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights?
