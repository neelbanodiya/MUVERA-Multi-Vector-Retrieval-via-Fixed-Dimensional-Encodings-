WRITTEN QUESTION P-3635/07 by Jean Lambert (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (10 July 2007) Subject: Recycling of plastics The European Parliament has already asked for compulsory marking of all plastics to facilitate collection and sorting for recycling (COM(2000)469 — C5-0633/2000 — 2000/2297(COS)). Moreover, to aid recycling of plastics, symbols have been cited in the context of the Packaging Directive (94/62/EC OJ L 365, 31.12.1994, p. 10 . ), but their use is voluntary. Despite assurances from industry that voluntary is best, letters we have received from local authorities highlight the opposite — that there is a will do more towards recycling but that local councils are being hindered by the absence of such symbols. Does the Commission agree that to achieve its aim of ‘a significant cut in the amount of rubbish generated, through new waste prevention initiatives, better use of resources, and encouraging a shift to more sustainable consumption patterns’ identification markings should be mandatory rather than voluntary? Will the Commission take follow-up action to ensure compulsory marking of plastics for recycling purposes? How and when will this be achieved?
