judgement of 22 November 2001, following which Member States will no longer be obliged to notify aids granted to businesses for public service tasks; Opening-up of the energy sector 24. Stresses that in the sectors where liberalisation is already under way the national authorities must ensure that universal public service requirements are honoured in full; 25. Considers that the opening-up of the gas and electricity markets is of major importance for the Member States' economies; urges the Commission, nonetheless, to take account of the potential need for specific guarantees in view of the key strategic role of these sectors in some Member States; 26. Approves the content of the agreement reached by the Heads of State and Government on this subject; stresses, however, that this agreement should not be taken as inevitably leading in the long term to a market totally open to competition or as pre-judging the ownership status in law of the enterprises concerned; Social policy and taxation policy 27. Considers that, if they are to be capable of responding to the economic and social needs of our time, the Member States must boost the value of work, facilitate continuous vocational training that yields results, and design flexible and modern fiscal and social arrangements, in order to allow and encourage the business spirit to flourish; 28. Welcomes the recognition given to the vital role of the social partners and the reference to the need for close cooperation between them and the authorities in the conception and implementation of social policies; 29. Welcomes the invitation extended to the social partners to play an active part in the forthcoming 'social summit'; 30. Endorses the European Council's proposals for employment, including easing the tax burden on lower-paid employees, altering tax and welfare rules so as to 'make work pay' and encourage the unemployed to look for work, and reducing individual incentives to early retirement; Transport 31. Welcomes the political agreement on the Galileo project and sincerely hopes, in line with the European Council's position, that the next Transport Council at its meeting in March will take the necessary decisions on the funding and launching of this programme; 32. Takes note of the requests of the European Council aimed at speeding up the adoption of the new priority projects for the trans-European transport networks (TENs), which should reduce bottlenecks in regions such as the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Baltic Sea; Development
