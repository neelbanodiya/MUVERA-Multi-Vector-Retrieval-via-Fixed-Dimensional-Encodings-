Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (28 May 2010) The Commission would like to recall that by the time it replied to the written question mentioned by the Honourable Member, the Spanish Government had decided to abandon the project and, in consequence, the Royal Decree-Law 3/2008 of 21 April had already been repealed by the agreement of the Spanish Government of 6 June 2008 (Spanish Official Bulletin number 138 of 7 June 2008). The provision in paragraph 2 of the First Additional Disposition of the Royal Decree-Law 3/2008 was, therefore, never implemented and the project never notified to the Commission. Therefore, the Commission is not in a position to judge whether it would have been in line with the EU legislation. As regards the principles and actions that the Commission is pursuing to ensure effective implementation of EC law, the Commission would like to refer to its communication COM(2007)502 final. ‘A Europe of Results — Applying Community Law’ and communication COM(2008)773 final. ‘on implementing European Community Environmental Law’. The Commission is following very closely the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) Directive 2000/60/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000 . . In 2001 a Common Implementation Strategy http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-framework/objectives/implementation_en.htm for the WFD was established by the Commission and the Member States, with the participation of stakeholders, with the aim of promoting good implementation. It has delivered to date more than 20 guidance documents that cover some of the key provisions of the directive and serves as a platform for exchange of best practices. In addition, the Commission has taken swift legal action to enforce the implementation of the key deadlines of WFD in 2003 (transposition into national legislation and administrative arrangements for the implementation), 2005 (environmental and economic analysis) and 2007 (monitoring programmes). According to the WFD, Member States should have adopted the WFD river basin management plans by December 2009 and should have reported to the Commission by 22 March 2010. To date 15 Member States have adopted the river basin management plans and three more are expected to do it soon as they have already concluded the public consultation foreseen in the WFD See overview of the status of adoption of the plans at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/participation/map_mc/map.htm . The Commission may consider taking appropriate legal
