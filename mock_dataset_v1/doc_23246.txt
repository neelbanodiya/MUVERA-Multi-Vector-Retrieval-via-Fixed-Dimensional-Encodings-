"Permanent crisis resolution mechanism" supported Discussions then turned to the proposed "Permanent crisis resolution mechanism" discussed at the European Council in late October to replace the current temporary bailout fund that has helped Greece, Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Mr Juncker said he was very much in favour, "but if the mechanism is established, we should deal intensively with the idea of eurobonds" (a long standing demand of the European Parliament). MEPs float involvement of private sector French Liberal Sylvie Goulard suggested that a system of pooling some EU public debt could be constructed. Luxembourg MEP Astrid Lulling (EPP) asked "would a default system - allowing the private sector to carry some of the cost of public debt not be useful in the Eurozone crisis resolution mechanism?"

Mr Juncker also said eurozone should be represented in international fora like the International Monetary Fund or the G20 but admitted there's no real will to do it which leads to a frittering away of influence.
