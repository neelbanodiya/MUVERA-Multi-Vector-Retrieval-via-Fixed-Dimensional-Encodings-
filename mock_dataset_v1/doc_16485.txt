Question for written answer E-010574/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Hans-Peter Martin (NI) (17 November 2011) Subject: Raids on natural gas operators On 27 September 2011, it was reported in the media that a number of undertakings operating in the natural gas sector had been raided. The searches were carried out by the Commission in connection with suspected breaches of competition law. What undertakings were searched? What premises, in which European countries, were searched and what documents, equipment and other items were seized in the course of these raids? On what basis were the searches carried out? Were they preceded by a Commission investigation, or was there a tip-off from an insider? Have the searches yielded any results yet? Has the Commission grounds to suppose that the undertakings involved have also contravened competition law in other business sectors? How soon could antitrust proceedings be initiated against the undertakings concerned if the searches produce evidence that competition law has been broken? Does the Commission suspect that antitrust law has been broken in other sectors of the energy market too?
