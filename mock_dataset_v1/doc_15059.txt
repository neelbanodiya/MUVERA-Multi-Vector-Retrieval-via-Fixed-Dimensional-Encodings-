Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (7 July 2010) The Commission recently issued an invitation to tender VT/2010/001. (‘Study on the social impact of emigration and rural-urban migration in central and eastern Europe’), which covers 25 countries. Under point 3 of the Terms of Reference, ‘social policy responses to support those “left behind” (spouses, children, elderly, those less qualified, etc.)’ are mentioned explicitly as points of special note for the compilation of the 25 national reports. The study is expected to be published in spring 2012. In accordance with EURES’s legal basis, it is not the latter’s primary objective to provide services directly to European migrants' families. However, in order to take account of any social problems relating to geographical mobility, the EURES guidelines for 2010‑13 specifically ask EURES members to cooperate with organisations such as non-governmental organisation active in the provision of information and assistance to workers and their families, with a view either to their integration into the host country or to their return to their home country under appropriate conditions and with full knowledge of their rights. No detailed information is available to date, however, on the specific activities EURES members will undertake in support of that guideline.
