Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (16 November 2011) 1 and 2. The granting of subsidies to beekeepers for moving bee hives located in areas surrounding GM field trials, as well as financial compensations to honey producers for possible losses resulting from the conclusions of the European Court of Justice in Case C‑442/09, are within the exclusive competence of the Member States. However, if a Member State decides to give compensation to its honey producers, that support given through public resources must be notified to the Commission in order to be examined in the light of Articles 107 an 108 TFEU. The Commission has already approved state aids aiming at compensating farmers for losses brought about by the presence of GMO in crops. 3. Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC OJ L 106, 17.4.2001. allows Member States to take appropriate measures to avoid the unintended presence of GMOs in other products, e.g. pollen from GM crops in honey. The recommendation of the Commission on coexistence, published in July 2010 http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/docs/new_recommendation_en.pdf , recognises the possibility for Member States to ban GMO cultivation in a territory where coexistence does not appear possible.
