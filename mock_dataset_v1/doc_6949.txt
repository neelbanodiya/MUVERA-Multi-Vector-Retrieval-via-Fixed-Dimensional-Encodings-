Question for written answer E-010784/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (17 November 2011) Subject: Results of the Dolceta programme for consumer education Several years ago, the Commission launched an Internet-based programme for consumer education in the 27 Member States. This programme was due to terminate in 2010, but has been relaunched following a double call for tenders corresponding to two further years. Can the Commission state: — the number of visits this programme has received since its creation, broken down by Member State and year; — the exact budget allocated to the programme since its creation; — whether it carried out an audit of the programme before deciding to extend it, and, if so, what problems were encountered?
