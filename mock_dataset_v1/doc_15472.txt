Question for written answer E-006275/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Robert Rochefort (ALDE) (28 June 2011) Subject: Situation of lawyers in Georgia and EU/Georgia relations The International Observatory for Lawyers has expressed deep concern about the situation of lawyers in Georgia. It says that Georgian lawyers are often threatened with prosecution, arrested or searched, and that some of them have even been convicted and imprisoned after defending clients whose cases are considered sensitive by the Georgian authorities. According to information forwarded by the Supreme Court of Georgia in November 2010, 26 lawyers were convicted in 2008, 23 in 2009 and 23 in the first 10 months of 2010. Is the Commission aware of these facts, which, if true, constitute violations by the Georgian state of the international conventions governing judicial proceedings? Does it intend to address the situation, and if so, how? Parliament has adopted a number of resolutions — including its resolution of 3 February 2011 on the situation in Tunisia (paragraph 13) and its resolution of 10 March 2011 on the Southern Neighbourhood, and Libya in particular (paragraph 20) — in which it calls on the EU to revise its democracy and human rights support policy by creating an implementation mechanism for the human rights clause in all agreements with third countries. Parliament has also insisted that the review of the European Neighbourhood Policy must prioritise criteria relating to the independence of the judiciary and respect for fundamental freedoms. In this connection, can the Commission say whether the situation of Georgian lawyers has been, or will be, discussed in meetings held with the Georgian authorities as part of the negotiations on an association agreement between the EU and Georgia? Lastly, can the Commission say what progress has been made with regard to the negotiations on the conclusion of such an agreement, which started on 16 July 2010?
