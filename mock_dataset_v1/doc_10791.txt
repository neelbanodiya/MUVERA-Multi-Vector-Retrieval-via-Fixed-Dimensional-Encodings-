P5_TA(2001)0194 Coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway ***I A5-0096/2001 Proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation concerning the granting of aid for the coordination of transport by rail, road and inland waterway ( COM(2000) 5 - C5-0402/2000 - 2000/0023(COD) ) The proposal was amended as follows: Text proposed by the Commission OJ C 365 E, 19.12.2000, p. 179.
