Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (28 July 2005) The Commission decision on the questionnaire referred to in Article 21 of Directive 2003/87/EC Directive 2003/87/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC, OJ L 275, 25.10.2003. on emissions trading was adopted on 4 May 2005 and published in the Official Journal OJ L 126, 19.5.2005 . . The Commission is engaged in continuous dialogue with Member States in order to propose a change to Annex III and can discuss such changes with Member States and other stakeholders at any time. Therefore, the Commission does not see the timing of these reports as a reason to change the date of 30 June 2006 for Member States’ submission of national allocation plans for the trading period 2008 to 2012. Moreover, the Commission considers it important to maintain the submission date of 30 June 2006 to provide companies with certainty about the allocation well in advance of the start of the second trading period. The Commission does not see any reason to postpone the mid-2006 review of the directive. If the Commission were to conclude that it would be desirable that certain changes to the scheme take effect as from 2008, it has the right of initiative and could make corresponding proposals to the legislator. The Commission will prepare further guidance (in addition to COM(2003)830 final Communication from the Commission on guidance to assist Member States in the implementation of the criteria listed in Annex III to Directive 2003/87/EC, and on the circumstances under which force majeure is demonstrated. ) to support Member States in their preparations for the second trading period. The further guidance will be developed in the light of experience gained from the assessment of the first round of national allocation plans. The Commission is aware of the link between the future development of the EU emissions trading scheme and the multilateral process on post-2012 climate policy. It will take this into account when considering changes to the scheme. The Commission has established informal dialogues with officials in Switzerland, Canada, New Zealand and Japan on the issue of potentially establishing links in the future between the EU emissions trading scheme and other schemes under Article 25 of the directive. In addition, the Commission is discussing
