WRITTEN QUESTION E-2932/10 by Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (3 May 2010) Subject: Soil and marine pollution in a protected area coming from a pig farm According to field research carried out by the Laboratory of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry of the National Technical University of Athens and the NGO Archipelagos, there has been widespread environmental pollution on land and at sea in the coastal area of Latzimas http://www.archipelago.gr/el/Home/NewsofArchipelagos/tabid/121/xmmid/462/xmid/1028/xmview/2/Default.aspx , a Natura 2000 protected site (GR4330004) in the Rethymno prefecture. According to the NGO http://www.archipelago.gr/el/%CE%9D%CE%AD%CE%B1/%CE%9D%CE%AD%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%91%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CF%80%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B3%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%82/tabid/121/xmmid/462/xmid/1112/xmview/2/Default.aspx , the only establishment which could cause such a level of pollution in the area is the pig farm owned by the Creta Farm company, which is less than a kilometre from the sea. The Ecocrete grouping of ecological associations http://www.ecocrete.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=6565&Itemid=0 has raised this issue, complaining, inter alia, that the concentration, after biological purification, of treated waste in the water used for irrigation is too high, that the environmental impact assessment for the farm incorrectly states that the area is suitable for the disposal of treated waste, and that the farm uses considerably more water than provided for by the environmental impact assessment. It should be noted that the company has an ISO 14001:2004 environmental management certification. 1. Will the Commission reconsider the conditions in the pig farm’s authorisations under the provisions of Directive 2008/1/EC OJ L 24, 29.1.2008, p. 8 . ? 2. Was the farm’s environmental impact assessment made public, allowing affected members of the public to express their opinions and objections in accordance with Directives 2008/1/EC and 2003/4/EC OJ L 41, 14.2.2003, p. 26 . ? 3. Does the farm respect the limits on ammonia emissions?
