as inadequate for the effective implementation of policies already agreed as well as of necessary new actions; has therefore decided to increase payments across the budget to a level of EUR 115,4 billion (1,04 % of GNI); underlines that this is still in line with budgetary rigour relative to the economic problems facing certain Member States; 4. Insists that the EU budget should contribute to more effective actions for the benefit of Europe's citizens, first of all an improved Lisbon agenda focusing on employment, social, economic and environmental cohesion and Europe's competitiveness; states that the involvement of young people is crucial for any sensible European strategy and shares the Council's political ambitions of a youth pact; disagrees fundamentally with budgetary reductions in this area and has decided to step up the focus on the Lisbon agenda including an increase in co-decided envelopes for Socrates and Youth, Research, Life and Intelligent Energy; urges the Council to agree a reinforcement of these priorities recognise these priorities, as was done at the end of the last programming period; Heading 1 5. Warmly welcomes the revision of the sub-ceilings of heading 1 in order to make possible agreed modulation measures related to CAP reform, agreed between Parliament and Council at the Conciliation of July 2005; 6. Recalls its position that the amounts suggested by the Commission in its budgetary proposal should be considered the minimum necessary and has therefore decided to reject the Council's reductions; believes that these appropriations are necessary while fully supporting ongoing reform measures in the sector; 7. Underlines the importance of innovation and renewal within the reformed agricultural policy of the EU, especially in the field of training and measures for young farmers; 8. Wishes to follow up on the use of budgetary amounts in sub-heading 1b (rural development) and in particular measures in relation to desertification and destruction by fire of rural and natural habitats, sadly demonstrated over the past years as a major EU challenge; calls on the Commission to make available an overview of the use of rural development funds in this area; draws attention to the importance of aid and solidarity under heading 1, including through the provision to specific organisations of food from intervention stocks for distribution to the most disadvantaged groups within the Community; Heading 2 9. Takes note of recent payment forecasts for structural actions and of information from the Commission in line
