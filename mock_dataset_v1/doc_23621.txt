assistance for tracking possible polluters, the Agency should contribute to reinforce synergies at EU level regarding certain coastguard operations. In addition, the Agency's data monitoring and collection should also gather basic information on potential threats to maritime transport and the marine environment from offshore oil and gas exploration and production. (10) The Agency has established itself as the authoritative provider of maritime traffic data at EU level which are of interest and relevance in other EU activities. Through its activities, in particular regarding port state control, the monitoring of maritime traffic and shipping routes as well as assistance for tracking possible polluters, the Agency should contribute to reinforce synergies at EU level regarding operations designed to prevent and combat marine pollution, encouraging the exchange of information and best practice among the various coastguard services . In addition, the Agency's data monitoring and collection should also gather basic information for example on piracy and on potential threats to maritime transport and the marine environment from offshore oil and gas exploration, production and transport. Justification The main task of coastguard services is to ensure national maritime safety. The strategy governing their actions is therefore the responsibility of Member States. If so requested, the Agency can provide expertise, but it should not be involved in coordination between the various coastguard services in the field of maritime safety. However, it is quite legitimate for it to be involved in the pooling of resources to combat marine pollution and this should be enhanced.
