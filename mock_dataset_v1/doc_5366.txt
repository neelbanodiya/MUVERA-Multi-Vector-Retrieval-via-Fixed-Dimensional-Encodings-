Answered by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (12 January 2005) The Commission is fully aware of and acknowledges the efforts made by Member States and private initiatives for the protection of autochthonous pony breeds as a cultural and genetic heritage, and wishes to assure the Honourable Member that no zootechnical or veterinary legislation was adopted aiming at compromising the genetic diversity of equidae. Motivated by animal welfare and public health concerns, and on request of the Member States, stakeholders and Members of the European Parliament, the Commission adopted implementing legislation to comply with the requirement for the harmonisation of the methods for identification of equidae, laid down in Article 4 of Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries OJ L 224, 18.8.1990 . . In a first step, the Commission adopted Decision 93/623/EEC of 20 October 1993 establishing the identification document (passport) accompanying registered equidae OJ L 298, 3.12.1993 . during their movement, as minimum criteria had already been agreed in Council Directive 90/427/EEC of 26 June 1990 on the zootechnical and genealogical conditions governing intra-Community trade in equidae idem (1). .

This legislation does not provide for derogations from the identification requirements for certain types of horses, such as free-ranging Welsh Mountain Ponies, when these animals are moved in accordance with Directive 90/426/EEC. As a consequence, Directive 2001/82/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products OJ L 311, 28.11.2001 . , as amended by Directive 2004/28/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 OJ L 136, 30.4.2004 . , now refers to Decision 2000/68/EC when providing certain derogations for the use of medicinal products in food-producing animals in order to improve the availability of veterinary medicinal products for treatment of equidae. However, the Commission, aware of the problems encountered by certain Member States, in particular those that in 1999 were most strongly
