9999/C Q999 E/031 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0755/04 by José García-Margallo y Marfil (PPE-DE) to the Commission (27 February 2004) Subject: Statistics relating to the harmonised consumer price index in Europe The harmonised consumer price index used by Eurostat is a benchmark for comparing inflation between Member States but, without casting doubt on its highly sophisticated scientific nature, how does the Commission explain the persistent feeling among the public in the euro zone that price rises far exceed the increase recorded by the harmonised consumer price index? Does the Commission realise that, if it cannot be changed, this public perception will have particularly negative effects as it is common knowledge that inflationary factors have very important psycho-sociological interactions and that the fall or stagnation in household consumption can partly be explained by this perception, which may well be mistaken, but which demands a convincing response?
