Question for written answer E-004489/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (6 May 2011) Subject: Israel: taxes on the Church and refusal to issue permits to bishops The Israeli Government has passed a new law which changes the way in which the property of religious institutions is taxed. The new taxes may make it impossible for the Churches to continue to be represented in the Holy Land, and they may have to abandon their pastoral ministry and their care of the needy in the fields of education and health. The new taxes flagrantly violate a legislative tradition going back to the Ottoman Empire, which was retained under the British mandate and in the Kingdom of Jordan and the UN Resolution of 1947 on the foundation of the State of Israel. Currently, the heads of the Christian churches in Jerusalem have joined in condemning the Israeli Government, which has refused to issue a residence permit for the city to the Anglican (Episcopalian) bishop Suheil Dawani. Bishop Dawani was born in Nablus on the West Bank: in East Jerusalem (where the Anglican cathedral and diocesan offices are located), he is regarded as an ‘alien’ — in a territory occupied by Israel — and could reside there only with a special permit, which the Israeli Interior Ministry has denied him. According to information gathered by AsiaNews, there is already another Christian prelate who is threatened with expulsion from Jerusalem for ‘crimes of conscience’ unless he withdraws his criticisms of the new taxes. 1. Is the Commission aware of these serious circumstances? 2. In view of the importance of the places in question, what measures will the Commission take to allow the Christian presence in the Holy City to remain there? 3. How will it protect the freedom of clergy to visit their community of origin?
