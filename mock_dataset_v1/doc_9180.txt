The House commends Nigeria in particular, for swiftly making available troops to be deployed to protect the civilian population and humanitarian relief. However, Parliament is concerned that the Multinational Force currently numbers only 2,127 men with most of them being taking up in Monrovia. The House regrets that the Security Council Resolution 1497 provides " exclusive jurisdiction " over persons who commit a crime as part of the Liberia peace keeping mission to the state that sent them. Parliament also calls for the economic sanctions against Liberia to be lifted but calls on all countries to introduce an embargo on arms for Liberia.
