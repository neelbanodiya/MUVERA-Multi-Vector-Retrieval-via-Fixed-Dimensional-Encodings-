WRITTEN QUESTION E-1983/09 by Jules Maaten (ALDE) to the Commission (26 March 2009) Subject: Low-energy lights as a radiation source On the basis of the directive establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy related products (COM(2008)0399), an EU‑wide phasing out of incandescent light bulbs is proposed. On the Facebook page of Jules Maaten, a senior European Commission official recently stated that there is growing evidence on low-energy lights as a radiation source. 1. Can the European Commission confirm that there is emerging evidence on low-energy lights as a radiation source, and what action will the Commission undertake if there are actually health risks? 2. Is the European Commission also aware of possible negative effects for filmmakers, as we need to retain the option of tungsten as well as fluorescent, as the look produced is different, and sometimes domestic bulbs as well as special lamps are used, e.g. when a table lamp is in shot?
