Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (15 April 2010) At the moment, there are no harmonised EU rules on the circulation of HGVs on specific types of roads. Directive 1999/62/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 1999 on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures OJ L 187, 20.7.1999. does not oblige Member States to provide toll-free alternatives to road infrastructure that is subject to road pricing for heavy goods vehicles. Therefore, a possible ban of HGVs from national roads in a local area in order to reroute them to a tolled motorway in that region should be assessed in the light of Articles 34 and 36 of the TFEU on the free movement of goods between Member States. It is settled case-law of the Court of Justice that those provisions of the TFEU, taken in their context, must be understood as being intended to eliminate all barriers, whether direct or indirect, actual or potential, to trade flows in intra-EU trade. In this case, it would be necessary to assess if HGVs would still be able to use national roads to supply customers located at such roads to appreciate the existence of a possible barrier to trade flows in intra-EU trade. Whilst the free movement of goods constitutes one of the fundamental principles in the scheme of the Treaty, it may, in certain circumstances, be subject to restrictions for the reasons laid down in Article 36 of the TFEU or for overriding requirements relating to the public interest. For example, the protection of the environment and public health or road safety may, under certain conditions, constitute a legitimate objective in the public interest capable of justifying a restriction to the free movement of goods. Therefore, the Commission does not have sufficient information to assess the compatibility of the possible ban to which the Honourable Member refers, with Articles 34 and 36 of the TFEU.
