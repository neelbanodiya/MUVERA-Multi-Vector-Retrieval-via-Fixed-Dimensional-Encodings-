democratic manner, closely tailored to the needs of the public, and emphasises in this perspective the essential role of women in the supply, management and conservation of water; 8. Hopes that cross-subsidies can be introduced to enable the very poor to be supplied with water at an affordable price; 9. Calls for the promotion of education and awareness-raising measures aimed at children, who are the key players for changing behaviour patterns; 10 Calls on the Commission and the Council to acknowledge the fundamental role of the local authorities in water protection and management, hopes they can be provided with direct funding to empower local authorities everywhere in the management of the water sector and regrets that the powers, experience and resources of the local authorities in the European Union are insufficiently called on, built upon and harnessed in European cofinancing programmes, since local authorities in the European Union, owing to their technical skills, know-how and experience are players especially able to assist the local authorities of developing countries; 11 Requests that the Commission represent the European Union at the Mexico Forum with a mandate to: - advocate access to drinking water as being a crucial and basic human right, and not an economic good subject simply to the rules of the market, - upholding the approaches expressed in this resolution; 12 Hopes that negotiations can be launched within a UN framework on an international treaty recognising this right; 13 Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission of the European Union.
