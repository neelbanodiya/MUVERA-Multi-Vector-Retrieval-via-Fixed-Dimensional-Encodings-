WRITTEN QUESTION P-2633/07 by Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert (ALDE) to the Council (14 May 2007) Subject: Absence of Council comment on the Polish Government's misconduct Further to my Question P‑1610/07 on the unacceptable conduct of the Polish Government, the Council has stated that ‘it is not Council practice to comment on public statements made by members of Member States’ governments’. The Council therefore had nothing to add to its reply to my previous Question E‑4767/06 (in which it said that it had ‘never debated the question raised’). In response to this I would remind the Council that a self-critical attitude on the part of the Council is essential to the public image of the European Union. The Council does not hesitate to support Poland when the issue is the Russian ban on imports of Polish meat. But when the fundamental rights of Europeans are in the frame the Council shrouds itself in silence. About seven years ago the Council was brave enough to state that Austria would be isolated while the FPÖ was part of its government. What was at issue at that time was not the public statements of government members, but public statements made in an election campaign. 1. Can the Council tell me why at that time (with the situation in Austria) it was indeed prepared to take action? If not, why not? Less than two weeks ago the Council had some warm words to say in the plenary debate on homophobia. It said the European Union was a community with mutual respect for one another. One in which any form of discrimination must be vigorously expunged, for which all the Member States had a particular responsibility. 2. Can the Council tell me in what way it is in practice going about the vigorous expunging of discrimination? If not, why not?
