the various pension-system pillars and focusing on their sustainability; 7. Calls on the Commission and the Council – given that a sustainable and properly functioning pension system is extremely important for citizens and for the stability of public finances – to ensure that the costs of pension reform continue to be taken into account in assessing whether a Member State should be subject to the excessive deficit procedure, and recommends that the focus should be on the sustainability of the funding system as opposed to any specific type of pension reform; considers it regrettable that certain Member States have reversed pension reforms implemented in recent years, or are considering so doing, in order to cut their budget deficits; notes that systemic pension reforms entail substantial transformation costs, which must be taken into account for the purpose of calculating government debt and budget deficits; 8. Emphasises that the sustainability of public finances requires the inclusion of total public and private debt in the assessment; points out that pension savings constitute something more than merely savings earmarked as pension; requests that the full scale of unfunded direct public-sector pension liabilities be made transparent and explicitly disclosed, with a view to the long-term sustainability of public finances; 9. Stresses that pensions and pension systems are the responsibility of the Member States; recognises that Member States’ economies are interdependent, and therefore calls on the EU and the Member States to properly coordinate their different pension policies and by using the Open Method of Coordination to guarantee the adequacy, safety and sustainability of pension systems; 10. Observes that the first-, second- and third-pillar pension schemes in Member States differ significantly from one another, that the EU lacks a set of common criteria, definitions and an in-depth analysis which would thoroughly explain the various pension systems and their capacity to meet the needs of citizens and that there is therefore a lack of transparent supervision applicable to all systems; stresses that the EU should primarily enhance the comparability of pension schemes and promote the exchange of good practices; is of the opinion that the Commission needs to make the necessary efforts to come up with a typology of pension systems in Member States as well as with a common set of definitions in order to make systems comparable; Gender 11.
