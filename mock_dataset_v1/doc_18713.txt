Answer given by Mr Tajani on behalf of the Commission (18 July 2008) The tailbacks at the Swiss-Italian border to which the Honourable Member refers were due, on the one hand, to the driving ban for heavy goods vehicles in force in Switzerland on Sundays and on public holidays and, on the other hand, to the closure of the Swiss customs office on Whit Monday, which is a holiday in Switzerland but not in Italy. This situation was publicly announced and was known in advance. Generally speaking, hauliers and other motorists are advised to use the information tools available (e.g. for Switzerland www.truckinfo.ch) and plan their trips in advance in order to avoid such inconveniences whenever possible. The Commission is well aware of the fact that customs controls at the borders between Switzerland and the EU may produce congestion at the border crossings at peak times. This is the reason why the Commission in cooperation with the Swiss authorities has over the past years consistently worked on improving customs procedures in order to render them as efficient as possible. The customs offices at the Italian-Swiss border at Chiasso/Brogeda are open 24h a day and seven days a week with the exception of public holidays. It is for the Member State concerned to make arrangements with a neighbouring third country to allow for the opening of customs offices also on public holidays.
