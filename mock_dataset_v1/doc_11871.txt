common heritage of humankind and must be protected, preserved and, where practicable, restored with the ultimate aim of maintaining global biodiversity and ecosystem functions, protecting the climate system, and safeguarding the rights of indigenous peoples and forest-dependent communities; therefore invites partner governments in Africa and third countries to develop land-use and resource management plans that will achieve these objectives, and to identify where and how much support would be needed from foreign partners and international organisations to move those objectives forward; 7. Calls on the Commission, against this background, to pay the utmost attention to ensuring that VPAs do not encourage the expansion of industrial logging activities into intact forest landscapes, and to work with the governments of the Republic of Cameroon and the Republic of the Congo and all governments signing up to VPAs in the future to monitor and take steps to eliminate the negative effects, both direct and indirect, of commercial logging on wildlife; Process of negotiation 8. Welcomes the voluntary, transparent, participatory and consensus-oriented approach through which the agreements were reached; recommends that this approach should become the norm for the negotiation of VPAs with other timber producing partner countries; 9.

Asks the Commission to establish a mechanism to ensure that the VPAs are enforced effectively and in a timely manner through the different stages of the implementation phase, guaranteeing in particular the reinforcement of the capacities of local stakeholders and the direct involvement of local communities and indigenous populations during the implementation phase, in order to ensure wider acceptance of the reforms that will be implemented upstream of the VPAs as well as full verification of imports into the EU; FLEGT licenses and legal frameworks 11.
