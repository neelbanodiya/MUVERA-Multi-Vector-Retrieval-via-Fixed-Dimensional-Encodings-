WRITTEN QUESTION E-1971/05 by Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (1 June 2005) Subject: Forced evictions of Roma families in Czech Republic In 2004 Roma in the Czech Republic faced discrimination regarding the right to adequate housing. Human rights groups reported that many municipalities attempted to force Roma families to leave. They employed tactics such as eviction from municipally owned homes for alleged lapses in rent payments or coercion of Roma into signing agreements, which they did not understand, curtailing existing housing contracts. While the Council of Europe Human Rights Commissioner publicly criticised such practices, the law allows municipalities a substantial autonomy in these matters. What will be undertaken by the authorities of the Czech Republic to avoid such practices?
