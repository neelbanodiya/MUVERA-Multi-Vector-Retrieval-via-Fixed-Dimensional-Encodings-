Question for written answer E-001713/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marta Andreasen (EFD) (2 March 2011) Subject: Opinion No 5/2010 of the OLAF Supervisory Committee — OLAF's inability to identify responsible administrative authorities The OLAF Supervisory Committee (SC) adopted its Opinion No 5/2010 on respect for fundamental rights and procedural guarantees in investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office on 29 November 2010. In paragraph 55 of its opinion the SC ‘notes the existence of shortcomings in the legislation concerning the conduct of external investigations in the area of direct expenditure. As far as projects financed exclusively by the European Union, and not jointly managed with Member States, are concerned, it is often difficult for OLAF to identify the national administrative authorities to which it can turn when on-the-spot checks are carried out. […] Cases in which these shortcomings have led to delays in, or serious difficulties with, investigations have been brought to the attention of the SC.’ Why is the Commission’s accounting system and all of its expensive software unable to provide OLAF with the identity of those national authorities?
