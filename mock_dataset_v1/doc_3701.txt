Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (5 May 2010) The Honourable Member's question relates to specific instances occurring in Greece where some five-digit telephone companies are engaged in alleged fraudulent activities, charging for unsolicited SMS services without the consent of the individual end-users who fall victim to such practices. The Commission is aware of the specific situation in Greece whereby a certain number of service providers after having secured the initial consent of individual end-users for offering value added services, engage these end-users in alleged fraudulent activities by charging them for unsolicited text messages and emails on their mobile phones containing links for downloading various multimedia services, for which the individual end-users have not given their prior consent. In response to the first question raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission would like to raise attention to a number of several provisions in EU directives which ban such unfair practices and ensure consumer protection in relation to the fraudulent use of e-communications services. The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive Directive 2005/29/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of Parliament and Council , OJ L 149, 11.6.2005. , the directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive 2002/58/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, OJ L 201, 31.7.2002.

For instance, the e-privacy Directive prohibits unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing without prior consent (Article 13), while the Universal Service Directive requires, inter alia , that Member States ensure that transparent and up-to-date information on applicable prices and tariffs is available to end-users and consumers. Greece transposed the EU regulatory framework with its national Law 3431/2006 on electronic communications, and its Law 3471/2006 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.
