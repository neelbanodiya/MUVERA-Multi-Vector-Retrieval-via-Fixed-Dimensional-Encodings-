WRITTEN QUESTION P-2095/05 by Daniel Varela Suanzes-Carpegna (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 June 2005) Subject: Negotiating mandate for EU-Morocco fisheries agreement In its reply to my previous question (P‑1526/05), the Commission said it had already received a mandate from the Council to negotiate a new EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, in the form of Council Decision 11213/99. 1. Is this a decision from 1999, or are we dealing with a new negotiating mandate from the Council? Can the Commission supply the exact date of this mandate? 2. What are the negotiating guidelines of the mandate? 3. Can Parliament be informed of those guidelines, and can detailed information on them be sent to the author of this question? 4. Can the Commission state whether the cephalopod fishery fleet, which is mainly Galician, will have the possibility of access to the Moroccan fishing-grounds under the new negotiating guidelines?
