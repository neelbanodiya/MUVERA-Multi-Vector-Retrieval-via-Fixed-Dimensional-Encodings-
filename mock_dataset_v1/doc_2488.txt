a considerable negative impact on the progress and development of this process, and of the FTA in particular; deplores the fact that for these same political reasons, the ministerial meeting of Euromed Foreign Affairs Ministers which was to have been held on 24-25 November 2009 in Istanbul was postponed and the UfM is not moving forward; 3. Recalls the definition in the UfM of significant projects in strategic sectors, such as the building up of new infrastructures, cooperation between small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), communications and the exploitation of renewable energy sources, in order to contribute to the development and to the facilitation of Euro-Mediterranean trade and investments; calls for meetings scheduled within the UfM framework to continue to be held and for a permanent secretariat to be established in Barcelona; 4. Regards the current obstacles as an indication that the deepening of economic relations must progress hand-in-hand with a deepening of political relations; believes that genuine regional and economic integration can be achieved only if concrete progress is made in settling existing conflicts and in the field of democracy and human rights; 5. Calls on the Commission, the Member States and the SEMCs to take into account the effects of the financial, economic and environmental crisis by incorporating social and environmental concerns into the economic and trade partnership to a greater extent; calls on the governments of the SEMCs to implement consistent and effective employment and social protection policies in order to mitigate the effects of the crisis; 6. Points out in this regard that the objective of the FTA cannot be measured simply in terms of economic growth, but also, and above all, in terms of job creation; points out that youth and female unemployment is the most pressing social issue in the Mediterranean countries; 7. Underlines the importance of the regional integration of the SEMCs and of increasing South-South trade; regrets that South-South cooperation is still under-developed; 8. Strongly encourages the SEMCs to develop South-South trade, taking their lead from the Agadir Agreement signed by Egypt, Jordan, Morocco and Tunisia; regards this measure as essential to regional integration; calls on the other countries in the region to join that agreement to further develop the integration initiatives in which the SEMCs are engaged and to exploit synergies with the deepening of the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements between SEMCs and the EU; stresses that the EU institutions must respond positively
