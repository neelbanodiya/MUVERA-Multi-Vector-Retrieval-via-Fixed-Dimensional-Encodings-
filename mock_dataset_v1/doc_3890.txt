ORAL QUESTION H-0870/07 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Marusya Ivanova Lyubcheva to the Commission Subject: Dissemination and advertising of products containing narcotic substances Various publications recently announced the market release of a product labelled ‘C-Ice Swiss Cannabis Ice Tea’ in a number of countries across Europe. Launched first in Switzerland, the beverage is now available in Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Romania and Bulgaria (non-exhaustive list). The producer explains that, to make it legal, the narcotic elements of the plant have been removed from the tea, and it is described as containing five per cent hemp flower syrup and a tiny (0.0015 per cent) quantity of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). However, this is not clear to consumers. There is a great concern that selling the product is dangerous and will lead to ‘normalisation of cannabis as an image in young people’s minds’. It even seems to be marketed as a health drink. Does the Commission consider such marketing strategies appropriate at a time when the use of alcohol, drugs and tobacco, especially among young people, is turning into a serious problem for society? Does the Commission envisage specific measures with regard to influencing control over advertising and marketing practices that could promote positive connotations of products or substances known in any other form or quantity to be of an illegal or harmful nature?
