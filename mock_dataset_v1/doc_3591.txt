Rapporteur Jim NICHOLSON (EPP-ED, Northern Ireland) had recommended the house to vote in favour of the common position, albeit with some minor changes. The regulation aims at ensuring adequate levels of insurance cover, a level playing field throughout the Community, in the sense that the same basic conditions apply to all air carriers operating in or over Community territory. Insurance documentation should also be verifiable. Parliament took the view that microlights and lighter categories of gliders should not be within the scope of the regulation in view of the costs this would impose on this area of leisure flying and the minimal risks it represents.
