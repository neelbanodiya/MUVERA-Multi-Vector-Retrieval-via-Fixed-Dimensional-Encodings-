Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (19 January 2012) The EU is fully aware and deeply concerned at the distressing events in the Tibetan areas. The EU raised the issue of rights of persons belonging to minorities — and in particular the self-immolation of Phuntsog Jarutsang and the punishment of other monks at Kirti monastery — at the last EU‑China human rights dialogue on 16 June 2011. Since then, several more Tibetan monks have set fire to themselves. The fact that a growing number of Tibetan monks are choosing to take such tragic steps clearly demonstrates the profound and continuing depth of feeling among many Tibetans that their religious, linguistic and cultural rights are not being respected. In her two days talks in Beijing with the Chinese leadership on 24 and 25 October 2011, the High Representative/Vice‑President took the opportunity to repeat the EU's consistent position on human rights.
