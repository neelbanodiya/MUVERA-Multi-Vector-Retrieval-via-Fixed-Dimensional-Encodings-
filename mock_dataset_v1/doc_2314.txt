Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (3 September 2008) The ongoing accession negotiations with Turkey follow the principles and procedures of the Negotiating Framework, which all Member States agreed upon 2005, as well as the December 2006 Council conclusions. The Council confirmed this approach on 10 December 2007. Negotiating Framework states that: ‘As agreed at the European Council in December 2004, these negotiations are based on Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union. The shared objective of the negotiations is accession. These negotiations are an open-ended process, the outcome of which cannot be guaranteed beforehand. While having full regard to all Copenhagen criteria, including the absorption capacity of the Union, if Turkey is not in a position to assume in full all the obligations of membership it must be ensured that Turkey is fully anchored in the European structures through the strongest possible bond.’ Provided negotiations are successfully concluded an Accession Treaty will have to be ratified by all Member States and the candidate country according to their constitutional provisions, on which the Commission does not intend to comment.
