2004). The amounts for subsequent years are not covered by an official pledge. Out of the EUR 190 million in 2005, EUR 100 million was financed through the mobilisation of the flexibility instrument in heading 4. 11. In a "monitoring group" on external actions with the rapporteurs from AFET and DEVE, a request was made to the Commission to provide implementation data from the international trust funds that manage the EC contribution. The reply from the Commission showed that the two trust funds - by March 2005 - had managed to implement 20% and 27 %, respectively, of an amount of some EUR 860 million committed not only coming. The rapporteur asks the Commission to update these figures. 12. Rather than analysing technically in this document all the various cuts in programmes made by the Council, the rapporteur prefers to reiterate the political message that the Council's attitude is unacceptable in the field of external relations. In order to respect Parliament's priorities, a first reading based on its proper evaluation should be followed. There is no chance that this necessary exercise can stay even close to the Council's proposal. 13. The Commission itself put forward a PDB requesting EUR 123 million in flexibility. This PDB, as mentioned, did already include, for example, the significant reductions for Human Rights, reductions for Latin America, internal re-programming for Asia, less money for development NGOs, and other doubtful proposals. The fact that Council has wiped out the Commission's request for flexibility (which was considered too modest by EP in the first place) and the fact that Council has introduced EUR 40 million in an entirely new action for sugar measure at the expense of other programmes, all make clear that there is a serious funding shortfall in heading 4. 14. The rapporteur intends to put forward some tables with various possible options for Cobu members on different scenarios. It currently seems that the funding gap to bridge is very substantial indeed and it cannot be excluded that the Council's attitude in the external actions field will be a crucial element as to whether the2006 budget will "make or break".
