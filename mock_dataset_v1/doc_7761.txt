Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (4 April 2005) The Commission is aware of various legal and administrative obstacles in Turkey that are used to deny non-Muslim religious communities the full enjoyment of their property rights in line with European standards. More generally, in its Regular Report 2004 SEC (2004) 1201 the Commission identifies the main problems encountered by non-Muslim religious communities as: lack of legal personality, restricted property rights, interference in the management of their foundations and the prohibition to train clergy. Work on a law on foundations, which has the potential to solve many of these communities’ problems, including those related to property rights, is currently ongoing in Turkey. Upon an invitation from the Turkish authorities, the Commission made certain recommendations as regards the draft law and it is hoped that this law will, inter alia, ensure that these communities’ property rights are guaranteed. In accordance with the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, the Commission will continue to monitor the human rights situation in Turkey, including the situation pertaining to freedom of religion.
