Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (22 April 2010) Negotiations with Colombia and Peru have been technically finalised at the last round of negotiations on the 1 March 2010 for the former and 28 February 2010 for the latter. A political discussion between the Member of the Commission in charge of Trade and the International Trademark Association (INTA) committee has taken place on 16 March 2010. Of course following the initialling of the agreement which is expected sometime in May 2010 and once the agreement will be signed, the conclusion process will involve the Parliament whose consent is required. Commission will, therefore, continue to engage with the Parliament on this important matter.
