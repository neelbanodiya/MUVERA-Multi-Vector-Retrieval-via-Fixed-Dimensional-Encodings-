Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (20 February 2012) The Commission was not aware of the closure of the Italcarta company. In the light of the information provided by the Honourable Member and despite the seriousness of the potential impact of the closure on the individual workers concerned, the latter do not appear to qualify for assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). Under the EGF Regulation Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006, OJ L 48, 22.2.2008, p. 82. , in addition to other criteria, at least 500 redundancies, as opposed to the 15 lay-offs referred to by the Honourable Member, are needed to trigger support from the Fund.
