which need a balanced implementation towards global prosperity, security and stability; 4. Believes that globalisation has added a new dimension to these challenges, that the rapid integration of export markets and the mobility of capital around the world have opened both new challenges and risks for the implementation of the sustainable development concept; 5. Notes that the plan adopted has both positive and negative elements; believes, however, in general terms, that the emphasis is more on economic, trade and development objectives than on environmental and social objectives, and that more balanced progress was required on both sets of objectives; further considers that the failure to establish a wider range of specific targets and timetables, as sought by the European Union, will reduce the effectiveness of the agreement, and make it harder to monitor progress towards meeting the general objectives of sustainable development; regrets the attitude of the US during the Summit; 6. Welcomes, in particular, the following positive features of the WSSD plan of implementation: - the specific target as regards halving, by the year 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water, and who do not have access to basic sanitation; - the agreement that chemicals should be used and produced by 2020 "in ways that lead to the minimisation of significant adverse effects on human health and the environment"; - the agreement to restore stocks of fisheries to sustainable levels by 2015; - the target to halve by 2015 the proportion of the world's people suffering from extreme poverty and hunger; notes, however, that more attention should be paid to linking the eradication of poverty with reforms aiming at a more effective integration of rural populations, including indigenous people, in modern forms of economic growth, especially by promoting land reforms and by developing policies for the modernisation of real economies and technologies; - the targets for improved health education, and for greatly reducing infant and maternal mortality rates and HIV prevalence; and calls in this context for EU support for and close collaboration with the newly established Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as for a more systematic follow-up to the action programme on reproductive health, agreed upon in Cairo 1994, which would contribute to the improvement of maternity care, reducing child mortality rates as well as limiting the spread of HIV/Aids; - the formal commitments
