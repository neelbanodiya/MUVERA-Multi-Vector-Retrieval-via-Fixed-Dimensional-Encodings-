preclude the introduction or retention by Member States of legislation affording a higher degree of protection against racism and xenophobia under criminal law. Justification There is no reason why Member States should be precluded from introducing or retaining legislation affording a higher degree of protection. After all, the explanatory memorandum (at page 6) refers to the Framework Decision as establishing the "minimum approximation necessary". Amendment 8 Article 2 Article 2 – S cope This Framework Decision applies to offences involving racism and xenophobia committed : (a) within the territory of the Member States, or (b) by nationals of a Member State where the act affects individuals or groups of that State, or (c) for the benefit of a legal person established in a Member State. Article 2 – Territorial s cope This Framework Decision applies to offences as defined in Article 4 committed within the territory of a Member State . Justification Clarification, necessary for legal reasons, of the offences covered and of the definition of the territorial scope and scope as regards persons.

This is not clearly reflected in the wording of the draft. Finally, point c does not define the Framework Decision’s territorial scope or scope as regards persons but rather the purpose of the offence, and this provision should therefore be laid down in Article 4. Amendment 9 Article 2a (new) Article 2a – Scope as regards persons The Framework Decision also applies to offences as defined in Article 4 irrespective of the place where the offence has been committed, if it has been committed by a national of a Member State, for purposes of prosecution in that Member State.
