first of its kind worldwide. Decision adopted by EP: 17.12.2008 Equipping power plants to store CO2 underground Parliament also approved a proposed directive providing the legal framework for the new carbon dioxide capture and storage technology (CCS). To cut their CO2 emissions, industrial installations and power plants could in future use this new technology to capture CO2 and store it "permanently and safely underground" in geological formations. MEPs secured the funding for demonstration projects by ensuring that 300 million ETS allowances will be awarded to large scale CCS projects in the EU. Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008 Applicable from: 24 months from entry into force 20% renewable energy in the EU's energy mix by 2020 A new directive will lay down mandatory national targets to be achieved by the Member States through promoting the use of renewable energy in the electricity, heating & cooling, and transport sectors in order to ensure that by 2020 renewable energy makes up at least 20% of the EU's total energy consumption. Under the agreement, by 2020, renewable energy - biofuels, electricity and hydrogen produced from renewable sources - should account for at least 10% of the EU's total fuel consumption in all forms of transport. Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008 Applicable from: 18 months from entry into force Reducing CO2 emissions from new cars A new regulation sets emission performance standards for new passenger cars registered in the EU. It sets a target of an average of 120g of CO2/km for the whole car industry by 2012, compared to the current levels of 160g/km. An average target of 130g CO2/km for new passenger cars should be reached by improvements in vehicle motor technology. This will be supplemented by additional measures to achieve a further 10g/km reduction, so as to reach the 120g/km target through other technical improvements. There is also a longer-term target for 2020 of an average 95g CO2/km emissions for the new car fleet. Regulation adopted by EP: 17.12.2008 Applicable from: third day after publication Less greenhouse gas emissions from fuels The revised fuel quality directive requires fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by farming, mining, transport and distribution, processing and combustion of transport fuels (i.e. fossil fuels like petrol, diesel and gas-oil and also biofuels, blends, electricity and hydrogen) by 6% by 2020 as compared to 2010.
