Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (21 October 2008) The Commission is concerned about the possible closure of several schools and orphanages in the city of Hebron after the eviction order issued by the Israeli Defence Force. According to information received from the EC Delegation in Israel, the Palestinian affected party recently withdrew the case from the Israeli High Court and is now negotiating directly with the Israeli civil administration. The Commission believes that the closure of these institutions would have a negative impact on the most vulnerable sections of the population. The EC Delegation in Tel Aviv and the Representation Office in Jerusalem will continue to monitor this case very closely.
