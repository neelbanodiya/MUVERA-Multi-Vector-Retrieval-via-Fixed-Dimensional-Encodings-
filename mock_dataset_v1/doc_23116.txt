in order for the EU and its Member States to be better able to contribute to the stabilisation and development of post-conflict societies; 14. Considers it vitally important that the causes of instability and the problems of post-conflict societies be tackled by a combination of civil and military measures; points out that without the security guarantees of peacekeeping forces on the ground the essential precondition for stability in conflict-torn societies (i.e. the security of individuals and their property) cannot generally be fulfilled; 15.
