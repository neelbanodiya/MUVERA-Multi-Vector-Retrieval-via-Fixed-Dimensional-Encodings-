are a fundamental force not only for family life and the education of children but also for public initiatives, conflict resolution and the promotion of lasting peace at all levels, as indicated in Paragraph 18 of the above-mentioned Beijing Declaration, 1. Calls on the Member States and the Commission together to make every effort to ensure that the EU speaks with one voice, to align aid delivery with partner countries' priorities and to make their actions more harmonized, transparent, predictable and collectively effective; 2. Stresses that the Commission will need to maintain the integrity of the development agenda and a clear focus on the ultimate objective of poverty eradication, and emphasise the effective implementation of priority policies, including a clear focus on results; 3. Stresses that the rise in the prices of raw materials played a crucial role in triggering the current global food crisis, which is in danger of wiping out all the efforts already made to improve the effectiveness of aid, and calls on the Commission and each Member State to support any measure which can help to stabilise raw material prices for developing countries; 4. Calls on the Commission to help integrate new members into the increasingly co-ordinated, international approaches to development policy and delivery with the appropriate mechanisms,, to work with new Member States to set out how they will meet the EU's additional objectives on aid effectiveness agreed at the Paris High Level Forum, and to explore the way forward for possible joint programming exercises; recalls in this context that the new Member States have committed themselves to ODA targets of 0,17% of GNI by 2010 and 0,33% by 2015, while their future contributions must reinforce the role of the EU in development cooperation; 5. Recognises the crucial role of democratic ownership and parliamentary oversight within developing countries for ensuring aid effectiveness, the need for the EU to provide resources and capacity development support to developing country parliaments to ensure that they have sufficient capacity to engage in scrutiny and oversight of their governments' budgets and the importance that better reporting of the results to the European Parliament, civil society and the Member States can help build confidence in Community programmes, increase accountability and permit more strategic forms of oversight; in this respect, calls on the Commission to propose a new indicator to monitor parliamentary scrutiny; 6.
