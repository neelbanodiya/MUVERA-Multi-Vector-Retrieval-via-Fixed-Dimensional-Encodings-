Question for written answer E-002329/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE) (29 February 2012) Subject: De minimis aid for market gardeners Market gardeners who grow vegetables in greenhouses and solariums in Romania have been greatly affected in recent weeks by the massive snowfalls there. To date, 80 ha of greenhouses and 280 ha of solariums have been affected, according to initial information. Could the Commission state whether it can grant a temporary increase in the maximum permitted levels for de minimis aid for these farmers?
