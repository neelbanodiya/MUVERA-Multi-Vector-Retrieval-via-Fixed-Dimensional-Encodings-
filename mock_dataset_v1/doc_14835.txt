Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (30 April 2010) Disciplines in international trade law are directed at reducing barriers to trade and eliminating discrimination in international trade relations. While free circulation of information online is first and foremost a political issue of the country concerned which implements its policy objectives, its limitation can have an impact on trade insofar as it might unduly restrict the provision of services or products or discriminate among suppliers. In this respect, and based on a case by case analysis, measures limiting the freedom of information flow in the Internet for political reasons could be challenged legally under international trade law where they unduly discriminate against foreign products or operators and where they cannot be shown to contribute to the public objective that they are supposed to achieve or when they are excessively burdensome as a means of achieving the objective. The forum for a legal challenge of such measures would be the GATS agreement, in addition to any other political means (direct dialogue or pressure) that could be exerted.
