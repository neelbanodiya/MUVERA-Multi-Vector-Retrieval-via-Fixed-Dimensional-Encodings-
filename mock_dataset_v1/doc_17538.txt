of the budgetary authority which would lead to more transparency and consequently to more security of financing and planning, when implementing policy areas which have the priority for the European Parliament; On Subsidies in 2006 Introduction 1. The objective of this short working document is to present the new system of grants and subsidies financed from the Community budget and give an overview of the proposals included in the PDB for 2006 concerning subsidies. Grants - from A-30 lines to ABB nomenclature 2. The entry into force of the new Financial Regulation in 2002 abolished the distinction between Part A: administrative expenditure and Part B: operational expenditure in the EU Budget.

The exception from this rule was the legal basis for equality between men and women, which concerned only years 2004 and 2005. The Commission has proposed to prolong this legal basis by one year until the end of 2006. In addition, the Commission is in the process of adopting proposals for the new legal bases for the period after 2006. 6. The legal bases concern: · Promoting bodies active at the European level and support specific activities in the field of
