ORAL QUESTION H-0338/07 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Mia De Vits to the Commission Subject: Relocation of Quinn radiator factory from Grobbendonk in Belgium to Newport in Wales, with 137 workers made redundant In March, workers at the Quinn radiator factory in Grobbendonk in Belgium learned that the company's Irish management plans to close their plant (making 137 people redundant). This decision coincides with the opening of a new factory in Newport, Wales, where production from Grobbendonk and also from Leigh in the UK is to be continued. The Quinn group operates in a number of very diverse sectors (including building materials, property, hotels, insurance) and employs 6400 people. As there is no European works council, structured communication of information and consultation are not possible. Could the Commission indicate what European support the Quinn group has received for the factories in Newport and Leigh? Is the Commission prepared to initiate a discussion on how large companies could be compelled to set up a European information and consultation structure? Is the Commission prepared to contact the regional authorities concerned in the UK and Flanders with a view to evaluating this restructuring?
