WRITTEN QUESTION E-1106/10 by Franz Obermayr (NI) to the Commission (4 March 2010) Subject: Legalisation of drugs in the Czech Republic In the Czech Republic the consumption of drugs such as cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis for own use has been legal since the beginning of 2010. Specifically, 15 g of marijuana, 1 g of cocaine, 1.5 g of heroin and four ecstasy tablets are permitted. These values are in part considerably higher than in the Netherlands! According to EU studies, Czech young people already lead Europe in terms of drug consumption (44 % of Czech people between 15 and 24 years old have taken illegal narcotics at least once). In addition, metamphetamines — amphetamines with an even stronger effect — are traded in the Czech Republic and are increasingly getting into neighbouring countries. In an area without border controls it is difficult for Member States bordering the Czech Republic to protect themselves against drug tourism. 1. Is there a response from the Commission to the drugs policy in the Czech Republic? 2. Does the Commission intend to prepare uniform directives with maximum limits for consumption of the abovementioned drugs? 3. Does the Commission intend to prepare measures to protect Member States bordering the Czech Republic?
