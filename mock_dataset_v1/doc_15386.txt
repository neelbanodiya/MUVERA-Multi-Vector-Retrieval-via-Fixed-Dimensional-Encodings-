Answer given by Mr Fischler on behalf of the Commission (5 June 2003) The Commission is aware of progress with this basin and the potential for crop development. However, given the cotton aid reform put in place by Regulation 1051/2001 Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton, OJ L 148, 1.6.2001 . — aimed mainly at discouraging any increase in cotton production that damaged the environment — and the budgetary implications of aid per hectare, it is hard for the Commission to envisage new legislation at this stage aimed at expanding cotton production. That said, it is the Commission's intention nevertheless to undertake a review of the future of cotton aid.
