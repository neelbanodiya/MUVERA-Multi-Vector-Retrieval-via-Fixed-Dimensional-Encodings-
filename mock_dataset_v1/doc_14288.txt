based on awareness of the possible risks and the benefits associated with the use of discoveries in the field of nanotechnologies; 23. Welcomes the consultation conducted for this proposal and encourages the Commission to continue improving its work in order to respond to the increasing demand for better regulation; 24. Welcomes the intention of the Commission to develop appropriate multilingual information material for different age groups in order to raise awareness of the progress and expected benefits of nanosciences and nanotechnologies; encourages the Commission to do so in close collaboration with Member States; urges the Commission to devise a communications strategy to raise the public’s awareness of the enormous opportunities offered by nanotechnology, and to allay their fears; considers that, as part of this communications strategy, the Commission should also make use of ideas such as a roadshow (featuring a Nanoscience Truck) or a nanotechnology award; 25. Calls on the industry to share in the joint effort and urges it to participate in developing nanotechnologies, taking into account their wider economic, societal, health, safety and environmental impacts and acting in accordance with the principles of corporate social responsibility; in this respect, stresses that businesses should help disseminate objective information about scientific discoveries in the nanosciences and nanotechnologies field, their intended uses, and their risks and benefits for society; 26. Emphasises that all applications and uses of nanosciences and nanotechnologies must comply with the high level of protection for human health, consumers, workers and the environment prescribed by the European Union and insists on the need for the codification of nanomaterials, which will lead to the drawing up of standards, which will in turn boost efforts to identify any risks; calls on the Commission to take the necessary initiatives to this effect; 27. Emphasises the importance of miniaturisation of products with regard to helping reduce waste and ensure better use of energy; 28. Emphasises that understanding of the potential damage to health and the environment of new, synthetic nanoparticles is still limited and, consequently, the effects of nanoparticles that are not readily soluble or biodegradable should be investigated, in accordance with the precautionary principle, before such particles go into production and are put on the market; 29. Considers that, within the framework of the new Community legislation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH), nanoforms of existing materials should be treated as new substances, because of their unique
