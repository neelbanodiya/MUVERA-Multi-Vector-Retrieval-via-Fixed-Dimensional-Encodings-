to leave temporary camps and return to their devastated homes, 1. Strongly condemns the decision of the authorities of Burma to extend the house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi; 2. Also deplores the detention of the group of political activists demanding the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and urges the authorities of Burma to liberate all political prisoners without further delay; 3. Deeply regrets that the Burmese junta conducted the referendum on the constitution days after a devastating cyclone hit the country and dismisses its results as lacking credibility; 4. Calls on the Burmese authorities to lift all restrictions on the peaceful political activities in the country and move towards an inclusive process of national reconciliation, restoration of democracy, the rule of law and full respect for human rights; 5. Further calls on the regime to provide explanations concerning the persons that remain missing since last September’s crackdown on protests by Buddhist monks and democracy activists; 6. Requests the Government of Burma to uphold the agreement made with the UN Secretary General to allow international humanitarian workers and supplies unhindered access to the areas affected by the cyclone and fully cooperate with the international community in assessing the assistance needs; 7. Is of the opinion that the EU’s targeted sanctions against the Burmese junta, although broadened after the September 2007 events by introducing an embargo on further sectors of economy, still have limited effects on the regime thus falling short of the objectives sought; therefore reiterates its call on the Council to take further steps and effectively hamper access of the junta to the EU’s financial system; 8. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments of the Member States, the governments of the ASEAN nations, the National League for Democracy, the State Peace and Development Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
