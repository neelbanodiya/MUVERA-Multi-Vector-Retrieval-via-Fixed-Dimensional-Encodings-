view of the benefits from the additional income for the agriculture and forestry sector, to implement a crash programme for the earliest possible organisation of production, collection of agricultural and forest residues, pyrolysis and use of the gas produced; 24. Recognises the growing importance of gas, as its share in total energy rises, and the need to use different strategies to ensure the security of gas supply, such as the development of LNG terminals and storage facilities as well as new pipelines; 25. Believes that nuclear energy is a part of the European political debate on the energy mix; Considers that, if nuclear energy production continues to play a role in some Member States, decisions on this matter can only be taken at Member State level within the framework of subsidiarity; 26. Agrees with the Commission conclusion that the first priority for action should be in the field of demand management measures to improve efficiency of energy use and reduce consumption through conservation; in this respect, deeply regrets the delay in bringing forward proposals for the transport sector; notes the economic potential of saving a minimum of 20% of energy consumed and notes that this potential will rise with increasing energy prices, technological improvements and economies of scale; 27. Notes that the building sector, which accounts for over 40% of all energy use in the EU-25, is the single biggest energy-consuming sector; notes further that rising energy prices are not only affecting the whole economy but above all the socially disadvantaged; encourages the Commission and Member States to come up with a coordinated effort to upgrade the European building stock in which innovative financing solutions are proposed in close collaboration with the European Investment Bank; RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 28. Recognises the importance of increasing investment in R&D, taking advantage of existing technologies and promoting new ones in order to keep Europe at the cutting edge in comparison with its competitors and to create new sustainable and long-term jobs, maintaining consistency with the goals of the Lisbon Agenda and paving the way for achieving, overall, Millennium Development Goal 7 concerning ensuring environmental sustainability; 29. Notes that there is considerable room for a further improvement in renewable sources of energy and for a global market in new equipment and systems based on RES, and calls on the European Union to provide renewable energy technologies endowed with sufficient resources in the Seventh Framework
