new budget line (130315) in the 2006 budget to assist in financing the creation of a network of organisations of small and medium sized organisations . Your rapporteur contends that the relatively small financial resources required for this budget line, which would be limited in an initial period to EUR 500,000 in commitment appropriations and EUR 250,000 in payment appropriations, could be found from the technical assistance envelope in the same way as extra funding has been found for the Northern Ireland Peace initiative. In summary, your draftswoman would recommend that the committee supports her proposal to maintain the appropriations proposed and justified by the Commission in the PDB as well as the creation of the new budget line (130315) in the 2006 budget to assist in financing the creation of an organisation of SMEs to improve networking skills. SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Regional Development calls on the Committee on Budgets, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions in its motion for a resolution: 1. Stresses the significance of the financial year 2006 for regional policy and points out that should there be no agreement on the 2007-2013 financial perspective: the 2006 budget will serve as the basis for the 2007 budget; 2. Regrets that on an accounting basis only, and without taking account of political priorities, the Council has adopted an across-the-board reduction of EUR 150 million in regional policy expenditure; 3. Takes the view that the Council conducted no serious analysis before making this reduction and that the rationale behind it is difficult to understand given that 2005 expenditure is high and that it will most probably be necessary to amend the 2005 budget to meet needs; 4. Takes the view that the amounts entered in the preliminary draft budget (PDB) for regional policy represent the bare minimum and therefore calls for all PDB lines to be restored.
