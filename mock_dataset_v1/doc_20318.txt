PECH MEP debate results of ICCAT Summit in Paris At the 30 November meeting, the PECH Committee had an intensive debate on the outcome of the recent yearly summit of ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas), attended by four members of the Committee, including the Chair Carmen Fraga Estévez (EPP, ES). While views diverged on the impact of the slight reduction of bluefin tuna quotas to 12.900 tons and on the refusal to extend the repayment of some EU countries' over-quotas, PECH members were unanimous in deploring the lack of decisions relating to a number of other important stocks, such as Mediterranean swordfish and big-eye tuna. 20101201CAN04468 ICCAT
