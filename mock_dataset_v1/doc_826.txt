Question for Question Time H-000147/2011 to the Commission Part-session: April 2011 Rule 116 Anne E. Jensen (ALDE) Subject: Use of SafeSeaNet to ensure a single maritime area When establishing the Pilot ‘Blue Belt’ Project in November 2010, the Commission chose to concentrate on ships engaged exclusively in internal EU trade. In particular, the beneficial use of SafeSeaNet is underlined in the project, as a tool to reduce administrative burdens on short sea shipping. However, deep sea shipping could also benefit from the use of SafeSeaNet as a tool to reduce administrative burdens, as these operators also carry goods between EU ports during parts of their international voyages. How will the Commission ensure that deep sea shipping also benefits from the potential facilitations foreseen in the Blue Belt project, and how does it intend to fully integrate these operators in the pilot projects? Will the Commission work in future towards a genuine single European maritime area, in which both short sea shipping and deep sea shipping draw on the benefits of SafeSeaNet, thereby ensuring a level playing field with other modes of transport and reducing administrative burdens in all parts of the shipping industry?
