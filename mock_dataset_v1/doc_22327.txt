9999/C Q999 E/084 WRITTEN QUESTION E-4069/03 by José Ribeiro e Castro (UEN) to the Commission (22 December 2003) Subject: European Maritime Safety Agency The European Council has finally decided on the seat of the European Maritime Safety Agency. The decision was taken to locate it in Lisbon, which is to be welcomed, in view of the city's geographical position and facilities, as well as the large area covered by Portuguese waters - both off the shore of the continent and in the regions of the Azores and Madeira - which are crossed by important trans-Atlantic shipping corridors and traffic between the north and south of the Atlantic and between northern Europe and the Mediterranean. For various political reasons it took a long time to reach the decision and it urgently needs to be implemented. Can the Commission therefore say: - when it expects to complete the final inauguration of the European Maritime Safety Agency in Lisbon and make it operational and whether it has already drawn up a timetable for this; - how many staff will be involved in running the Agency, whether they have already been recruited and in accordance with what instruments and timetable; - out of the list of duties already established, what priority tasks will be allocated to the European Maritime Safety Agency and its directors as soon as it is fully launched in Lisbon?
