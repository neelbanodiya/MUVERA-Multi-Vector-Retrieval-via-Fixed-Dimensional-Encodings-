Answer given by Mr Andor on behalf of the Commission (19 March 2010) Article 153 TFEU, pursuant to paragraph 5 thereof, does not apply to pay, the right of association or the right to strike. The Commission therefore has no competence to intervene in the dispute in the Carrefour group in Italy referred to by the Honourable Member, which relates to negotiations under way between the trade unions and the employer on wages, bonuses and other allowances. It is for the social partners concerned to conclude agreements on such issues with due respect to the relevant national and international law. As regards the more general issue regarding the future of the company, including any restructuring, the Commission reiterates the principles, policies and instruments referred to in its communication ‘Restructuring and Employment’ COM2005(120) final of 31 March 2005. and the good practice on restructuring agreed by the European social partners in November 2003 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=782&langId=en . Both documents contain useful guidelines on anticipating, preparing and managing change and restructuring in a socially responsible way.
