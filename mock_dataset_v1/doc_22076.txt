Answer given by Mr Borg on behalf of the Commission (19 May 2005) To our knowledge, the company ‘Rio Praaning and Lyart Consultants’ has never been in contact with the Commission nor has it been consulted or involved by the Commission services in the context of the preparation of its legislative proposal establishing the possibility to transfer small Community’s fishing vessels to the countries affected by the tsunami of last December. Meanwhile, following the favourable opinion of Parliament, the Council adopted formally and unanimously a regulation, on 16 March 2005, allowing such transfers during a limited period of time and defining a variety of eligibility criteria.
