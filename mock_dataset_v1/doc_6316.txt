Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (4 February 2010) The Commission is aware of the impact of the unprecedented economic crisis which is hitting EU regions, including the Oporto district in Portugal. The Commission would point out that responsibility for employment policy lies primarily with the Member States. However, the Commission has proposed a series of measures aimed at limiting the impact of the crisis on the social and employment situation in the EU. In this connection, under the European Economic Recovery Plan COM(2008)800. , the Commission has proposed, inter alia, to modify the rules of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund COM(2008)867. . Furthermore, the Commission has proposed to modify Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund as regards certain provisions related to financial management to help speed up implementation of projects on the ground. In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the EU Structural Funds are managed on a decentralised basis through the national and regional authorities, and the Commission would therefore suggest that the Honourable Member contact the Portuguese authorities responsible for managing the operational programmes directly. Concerning the financial resources made available for productive activities in Portugal, the bodies to contact are as follows: Gabinete de Gestão do Programa Operacional ‘Norte 2007‑13’ Rua Rainha D.
