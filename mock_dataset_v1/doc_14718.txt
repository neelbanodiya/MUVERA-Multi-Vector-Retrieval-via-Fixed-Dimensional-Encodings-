Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (1 July 2005) The European Investment Bank (EIB) contributed to the financing of several projects in the context of the 2004 Olympic Games, e.g. the International Broadcasting Centre and improvements in the transport network of Athens, as well as infrastructure projects in different Olympic cities. The State, in its capacity as borrower of the EIB loan, has agreed to several undertakings in relation to construction and operation of the different projects financed by the EIB. For any deviation from the original use of such projects the EIB needs to be informed and, when necessary, agree. On that basis, to the extent that schemes financed by EIB are directly affected by the new bill, which also covers installations not financed by the EIB, the State must accordingly inform the Bank, seeking the necessary consent if required. Therefore, the EIB’s agreement would be required for specific projects and not for the new bill proposed by the Greek Parliament. Accordingly, the EIB has not raised any objections or comments on the bill itself.
