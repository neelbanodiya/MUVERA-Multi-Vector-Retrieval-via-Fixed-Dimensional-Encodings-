Question for written answer E-006089/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Fiona Hall (ALDE) (27 June 2011) Subject: Differences in car fuel consumption Official fuel consumption figures from car manufacturers are often much higher than the actual miles per gallon achieved by cars driven in urban, extra urban and combined conditions. Manufacturers electronically optimise their vehicles to do well in the certification tests, so that they will be classed in a lower tax bracket. They can also alter the load carried in the vehicle by removing essentials, such as a spare wheel. How does the Commission define norms for fuel consumption tests? For example, what is classed as a normal load in a car during testing? What is the Commission doing to ensure that the parameters used for testing reflect real driving conditions and that car manufacturers are not undermining the testing system?
