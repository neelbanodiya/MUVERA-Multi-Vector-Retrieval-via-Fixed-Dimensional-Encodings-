Answer given by Ms Geoghegan-Quinn on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2010) The Commission, through its 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007‑13), is funding research to find alternative approaches to the use of animals in research, including research using human cells in culture. The use of cells from human embryos and foetuses for this research is not forbidden but it represents a very limited part of all other alternative approaches being developed within the FP7 projects. Furthermore, to receive FP7 funding, all research projects involving cells derived from embryos and foetuses should comply with the ethical requirements of FP7 Decision 2006/1982/EC, OJ L 412/1, 30.12.2006. and with its specific programme ‘Cooperation’ Decision 2006/971/EC, OJ L 54/30, 22.2.2007. and should be fully in line with the statements made by the Commission regarding Article 6 OJ L 412/5 and OJ L 412/42, 30.12.2006. . These FP7 decisions explicitly exclude research activities intended to create human embryos solely for the purpose of research or for the purpose of stem cell procurement. Thereby, research projects using stem cells isolated from embryos (human embryonic stem cells, hESC) are only authorised if done with existing hESC lines that were generated previously with other funding sources. No research will be funded that is forbidden in all Member States. Furthermore, no activity will be funded in a Member State where such activity is forbidden. In 6th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP6), the Commission funded 18 projects (total EU contribution: EUR 122 million) involving hESC of which five projects targeted in vitro research with a view to replacing animal experimentation on toxicology related to drug testing or drug development. In FP7 (up to April 2009), the Commission funded 16 projects (total of EUR 48.5 million of EU contribution) involving hESC of which only one (ESNATS) http://www.esnats.eu/ targets research in view of animal replacement whereas the majority of these projects are linked to regenerative therapies. These projects have a duration of three to five years. All projects involving the use of animals (that fall under the scope of Directive 86/609/EEC Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes OJ L 358 , 18.12.1986. ) and/or the use of hESC must undergo an Ethics Review COM(2008)4617 — Annex A,
