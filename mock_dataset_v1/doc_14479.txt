2004/C 33 E/089 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1358/03 by Geoffrey Van Orden (PPE-DE) to the Commission (10 April 2003) Subject: The Via Baltica road project in Poland 1. Is the Commission aware of the possible threat that the upgrading of the Via Baltica road to an expressway through the Biebrza Marshes and the forests of Knyszyn and Augustow in Poland may pose to these environments? 2. Will an environmental assessment of the potential impact of the project and an evaluation of alternative routes be carried out before any EU funding might be provided? 3. Will EU funding be provided to the Via Baltica road scheme even if the project is deemed to break EU environmental directives which the Commission has said should apply to all new infrastructure investments in EU candidate countries?
