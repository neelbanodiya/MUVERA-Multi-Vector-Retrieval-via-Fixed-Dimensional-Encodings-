for financial resources available in the European capital markets, as well as in world capital markets. (5) It is important for the competitiveness of European capital markets to achieve convergence of the norms used in Europe for preparing financial statements, with international accounting standards that can be used globally, for cross-border transactions or listing anywhere in the world.
