Eastern Europe and the New Independent States. A number of constraints can be identified as far as the measurement of child poverty is concerned: Firstly, current definitions (poverty lines) seem too narrow (income-based only) to adequately capture the extreme complexity of the problem. Secondly, most of the poverty monitoring units within the governments concerned have been set up recently and assessment capacity is still to improve. Thirdly, fine-tuning of methodology, including for poverty-mapping of children specifically, needs to be continued. Fourthly, child poverty, by its own nature, is often more ‘hidden’ than other types of poverty. Better poverty data and their dissemination will contribute to domestic pressure on governments to ensure their policies become increasingly pro-poor. Also, in this respect, the Commission welcomes in particular this report.
