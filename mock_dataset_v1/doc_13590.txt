ORAL QUESTION H-0776/03 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by John Bowis to the Commission Subject: Caged beds Is the Commission aware of the continued use of caged beds in four accession countries, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia? This practice involves the locking into caged beds, sometimes for weeks and months at a time, of elderly people with dementia and others of all ages with a mental health or behavioural problem. It is widely seen, both internationally and within the countries concerned, as a human rights abuse and an archaic method of containment and restraint. It is not used in any EU Member States or in any other accession country. Will the Commission welcome moves in the four countries to review and reduce the use of caged beds and work with them to agree a timetabled phasing out of all such beds?
