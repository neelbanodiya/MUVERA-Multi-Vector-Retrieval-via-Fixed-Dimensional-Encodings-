At the time of writing your draftsman has examined the Preliminary Draft Budget (PDB) as adopted by the Commission on 27 April 2005. The Draft Budget to which Parliament will propose amendments will be adopted by Council on 15 July. As in previous years your draftsman reserves the right to revisit the matter of amendments to be adopted by the Transport and Tourism Committee once the Council's Draft Budget is available. The 2006 Preliminary Draft Budget shows an increase in commitment appropriations of 4% and in payment appropriations of 6%. It proposes to draw upon 1.09% of EU Gross National Income (GNI) in commitment appropriations, significantly below the figure initially proposed by the Commission in the context of the Financial Perspective for 2007-2013. The PDB has 121.3 € billion
