Parliament's Rules of Procedure are published periodically in booklet form and in the Official Journal of the European Union . These editions may be obtained from the Publications Office of the European Union. The European Parliament may, however, amend its Rules of Procedure from time to time. The version in force is available on the European Parliament's website (http://www.europarl.europa.eu). Text in italics indicates an interpretation of the Rules (pursuant to Rule 211).
