out that the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy laid down in Article III‑227 run counter to the objectives of the European Union set out in Article I-3; for this reason, regards it as essential that the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy should be updated with a view to taking account of recent developments in that policy and, in particular, its multifunctional role vis-à-vis farmers themselves, rural development, the environment and consumers and measures to prevent contagious animal diseases;. 5. In the light of the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy continues to regard the following text as appropriate: 'The objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy are: (a) to support the development in the European Union of a multifunctional agricultural sector which is respectful of the environment, animal protection requirements and the landscape, which fosters biological diversity and which rewards farmers for their contribution to these aims, (b) to increase agricultural productivity by means of the promotion and responsible exploitation of technological progress, the rationalisation of farm production methods and effective use of production factors, (c) offer the rural population long-term prospects, in particular by means of rural development policy measures , a level playing field for their products on the EU markets and measures to safeguard and create jobs in rural areas, (d) stabilise markets, guarantee that the public is supplied with high-quality and safe foodstuffs, which are produced under reasonable standards as regards animal welfare, the environment and labour, (e) develop innovative techniques and concepts with the aim of improving the quality of food production, reducing input and production costs and using agricultural products as raw materials for example as renewable energy sources, 6. Considers that these objectives should, in any case, be contained in a possibly abridged Constitutional Treaty limited to defining the objectives, division of tasks and major EU decision-making procedures, while more detailed provisions may be contained in a separate treaty; 7. Calls for measures to be taken as part of the European Union's communication strategy to keep the European public informed about the common agricultural policy, particularly regarding recent changes to update it and bring it into line with the new Community objectives; PROCEDURE Title The period of reflection: the structure, subjects and context for an assessment of the debate on the European Union Procedure number 2005/2146(INI) Committee responsible AFCO Committee asked for its opinion D a te announced in plenary AGRI 7.7.2005
