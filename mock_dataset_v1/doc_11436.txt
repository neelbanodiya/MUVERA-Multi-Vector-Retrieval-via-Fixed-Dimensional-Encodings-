Question for written answer E-4917/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Mario Mauro (PPE) (2 July 2010) Subject: Iranian bombing of Kurdistan Since the beginning of June, Iran has been once again encroaching on Iraqi Kurdistan, in the border zone between the two countries. Tehran's forces have repeatedly bombarded the area bordering on Iraqi Kurdistan, which is the refuge of the combatants of the Pjak, an Iranian-Kurdish separatist movement operating from bases located in Iraqi Kurdistan. In the last few days, a score of Turkish hunter-bombers have bombarded the Kurdish village of Sidakan, on the Iran-Turkey border. These reports emanate from the Kurdish dissident movement, and add that some twenty civilians were hurt in the bombings, most of them women and children. 1. Is the Commission aware of Iran's bombing of Iraqi Kurdistan, in defiance of international law? 2. What measures will the Commission take, in particular for the protection of the local population?
