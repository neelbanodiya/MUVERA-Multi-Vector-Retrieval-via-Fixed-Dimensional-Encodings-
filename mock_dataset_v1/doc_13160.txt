in the applicant countries, protection of the environment, energy safety and security, protection of minorities, gender discrimination, and asylum and migration policy; 3. Welcomes the Council's decision that the peaceful settlement of all border conflicts, if necessary through bringing outstanding disputes before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, is considered as part of fulfilling the Copenhagen criteria for accession to the Union; 4. Takes note of the decision to consider Turkey a candidate country for membership of the European Union; reiterates its position, however, that negotiations cannot be opened because Turkey is a long way from meeting the political criteria of Copenhagen; 5. Welcomes the fact that the European Council recalled the importance of high standards of nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe and explicitly shares its view that the Council should consider how to address the issue of nuclear safety in the framework of the enlargement process in accordance with the relevant Council conclusions; 6. Regrets that no concrete decisions have been taken with regard to the future of the European Conference; Intergovernmental Conference 7. Deplores the lack of political vision displayed by the European Council, which has restricted institutional reform at the next ICG to the size and composition of the Commission, the weighting of votes in the Council and the possible extension of qualified majority voting in the Council; 8. Notes the possibility of entering other items on the agenda for the IGC, and strongly recommends not waiting until the end of the forthcoming Portuguese Presidency to do so; 9. Considers that this reform is inadequate to ensure that an enlarged Europe can function effectively; 10.

Notes that the European Council clearly supports the reform of the Commission's administration and recognises the need to make substantial changes to the Council's working methods, measures that are essential if these institutions are to become more effective and prepare themselves for enlargement; is concerned about the obvious lack of ambition of the Commission in its forthcoming proposal for a Regulation on public access to documents; urges yet greater openness on behalf
