ORAL QUESTION H-0073/08 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Katerina Batzeli to the Commission Subject: Implementation of Article 69 of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 (retention to improve quality) As part of the review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) an optional mechanism has been introduced under which Member States may retain up to 10% of the aid they receive within the framework of the First Pillar in order use it as additional payments for specific types of farming which are important for the protection or enhancement of the environment or for improving the quality and marketing of agricultural products (Article 69, Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 ). Recently the Commission’s Communication COM(2007)0722, published in preparation for the ‘health check’ of the CAP reform, provided for a review of this Article so as to enable it to be implemented beyond the sector level. Will the Commission say whether it has carried out an impact study regarding the orientations of its Communication on preparing for the ‘health check’ of the CAP reform and on the implementation to date of Article 69, or at least whether it has any data which would justify broadening its scope? 5 OJ L 270, 21.10.2003, p. 1.
