ORAL QUESTION H-0747/02 for Question Time at the part-session in December 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou to the Commission Subject: Funding for the northern part of Cyprus At the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 24-25 October 2002, it was decided, with a view to the implementation of a political settlement in Cyprus, to set up a special programme for the northern part of the island with a total budget of 206 million euro for the three-year period 2004-2006. Has the Commission been asked to prepare such a programme and, if so, will it take account of specific priority areas when setting it up? Will it make provision for specific control mechanisms in respect of this funding and, if so, how? In the event that a political settlement between the two sides fails to materialise, will the funding still be made available?
