Answer given by High Representative/Vice President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (24 August 2011) Violence against women in both the public and the private spheres remains an issue of concern which is being addressed at various levels in line with the EU guidelines on discrimination against women and any form of violence against them. The EU Delegation in New Delhi, through its regular interaction with women's organisations, both at national and state level such as the Centre for Social Research and the National Commission for Women, is fully aware of instances of violence or violation of women's rights. Efforts are being made to address the gap between social norms and the existing domestic legal framework ensuring women rights (such as honour killings). There has been some interaction with the Kerala government on that State’s model of local governance. Apart from an ongoing project on access to justice, which includes the state of Kerala, the new EU-funded country-based call for proposals to be launched in Delhi under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights will address human rights capacities and raise awareness at local level, including on sensitive gender issues.
