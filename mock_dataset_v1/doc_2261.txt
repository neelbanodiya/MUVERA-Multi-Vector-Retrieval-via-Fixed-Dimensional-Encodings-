Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (23 November 2011) The Commission would refer the Honourable Member to its answers to Written Questions P‑8936/2010 , E‑000025/2011 , P‑000175/2011 and E‑003552/2011 as well as E‑007375/2011 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp . Developing effective and novel alternative methods has been a priority under the framework research programmes of the European Union for more than 20 years and in that time more than EUR 200 million have been spent EUR 23886 — Alternative testing strategies — Progress Report 2009: Replacing, reducing and refining use of animals in research, genomics and biotechnology for health. . In 2010, the role of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), hosted and funded by the Commission's Joint Research Centre, has been strengthened by granting ECVAM the status of European Union Reference Laboratory. Moreover, under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development so far more than EUR 65 million has been committed to the funding of alternative methods. More particularly, to address the lack of methods replacing animal tests in the assessment of toxic effects of chronic exposure, the Commission had launched in 2010 a research project of EUR 25 million entitled ‘Towards the replacement of repeated dose systemic toxicity testing in human safety assessment’ FP7-Health-2010-Alternative Testing. . This project is a joint effort with the European Cosmetic Association (Colipa), which provided an additional EUR 25 million. As a result, 7 new research projects in this field have started in January 2011, for a total amount of EUR 50 million. These projects will closely cooperate to lay the scientific foundation for future safety testing methods with a higher predictive value, faster and cheaper than animal tests. They will combine the research efforts of over 70 European universities, public research institutes and companies.
