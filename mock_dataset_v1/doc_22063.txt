Answer given by Mr Rehn on behalf of the Commission (3 January 2011) In its response to the Honourable Member’s earlier question, the Commission did not suggest additional formal measures changing the authorities' revenue and expenditure plans. It rather called for corrective efforts of an administrative or operational nature to contain expenditure according to the plans that were public at that time in order to achieve the 2010 fiscal target set by the Portuguese authorities. As it is known, in principle the Commission does not prescribe specific consolidation measures — it is up to the national authorities to decide on which measures fit their fiscal problems best. In the current case of Portugal, the consolidation plans included in the Budget for 2011 rely more on expenditure-reducing measures than revenue-enhancing ones. The Commission has already welcomed the Budget and called for broad agreement for the continued fiscal consolidation needs. Further details on Portugal's public finances are contained in the Commission’s autumn forecast, which was published on 29 November 2010.
