Union in the context of enlargement and cultural diversity [2003/2057(INI)] Doc.: A5-0271/2003 Procedure : Own-initiative Debate : 04.09.2003 Vote: 04.09.2003 In adopting an own-initiative report with 431 votes in favour, 30 against, and 23 abstentions. Parliament criticises the lack of EU legislation on regional and less widely-used languages. Around 40 million people in the EU are estimated to use a regional or minority language regularly in addition to the official language(s) of their country. A budget line introduced in the 1980s by Parliament to support these languages is currently a dead letter because the Commission has been unable to use the funds following a 1998 ruling by the Court of Justice that there is no appropriate legal basis for the policy. To overcome this problem, Parliament calls on the Intergovernmental Conference which is to discuss the draft constitution proposed by the Convention to include in the provisions on EU culture policy a reference to the promotion of linguistic diversity, including regional and minority languages as an expression of cultural diversity. In addition to this demand, MEPs make a number of recommendations to the Commission. They call on it to carry out a feasibility study on the creation of a European Agency for Linguistic Diversity and Language Learning. They also want a multi-annual programme drawn up on linguistic diversity (including regional, minority and sign languages), together with financial measures to promote acceptance of multilingualism, including co-existence between official and "co-official" languages.

The House restates its view that a complete overhaul of the directive is needed to take account of technological developments and changes in the structure of the audiovisual market. MEPs want the basic principles underlying the current directive (free movement of European television programmes, free access to events of major importance, the promotion of European and recently produced independent works, protection of minors and public order and protection of consumers) to be re-presented in the form of a framework package bringing together the " Television without Frontiers " directive, the e-commerce directive and the directive co-ordinating certain copyright rules
