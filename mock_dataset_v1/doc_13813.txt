without any exception; 6. Condemns the attempts by Russia to exert economic pressure on Estonia as an instrument of foreign policy and calls on the Russian Government to restore normal economic relations between the two States in accordance with the generally accepted norms of conduct and according to the WTO rules; stresses once again that the EU stands in full support of its Estonian colleagues and does not accept the threats and economic pressure exerted by Moscow; 7. Reminds the Russian authorities that the indiscriminate and openly hostile rhetoric used by the Russian authorities against Estonia is in sharp contrast to the principles of international behaviour and will cause harm to EU-Russia relations as a whole; 8. Regrets that the computer attacks were not specifically discussed at the EU-Russia Summit in Samara; calls on Russia immediately to stop computer attacks against websites of Estonian governmental bodies and the President’s office, as well as sites of newspapers, television stations, schools and banks, as it has been established that the majority of them were made from the IP addresses of specific computers and by specific individuals from Russian governmental bodies, including the administration of the President of the Russian Federation; 9. Calls on the Russian Government to engage in an open and unbiased dialogue with the eastern and central European democracies on the history of the 20th century, as well as crimes against humanity, including those of totalitarian communism; 10. Stresses that during the years of Soviet occupation after World War II, tens of thousands of Estonians were killed in deportations and other forms of repression; once again encourages Russia, which claimed and received legal successor state status to the USSR, to recognise the fact of the occupation of the Baltic States and to take full responsibility for the damage and losses caused by it; 11. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Russian Federation, and the Council of Europe.
