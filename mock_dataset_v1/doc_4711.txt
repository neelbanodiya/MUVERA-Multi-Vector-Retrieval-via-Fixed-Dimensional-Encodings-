additional customs duties imposed under the special safeguard clause (SSG) could be a useful means of protecting sensitive sectors of the Community market, including those in the new Member States, from surplus imports or from imports at excessively low prices; calls on the Commission to negotiate in the current WTO round the possibility of making appropriate changes to the scope of the SSG in the EU's list of concessions; points out that some of the new Member States had the opportunity to apply the SSG in sensitive agricultural sectors not on the EU's current list of concessions; 41. Expects that the future CAP will not only take into consideration the needs of the enlarged EU but that it will also become easier to manage, that it will reduce the administrative burden of farmers and national authorities and will support the market-oriented, environmentally sound production of safe products, while ensuring the future of sustainable agriculture; 42. Invites the Commission, the Member States and all stakeholders to conduct a lively discussion and submit forward-looking proposals in order to build a sustainable future of the agriculture in the enlarged EU; 43. Welcomes the Commission's intention to draw up a long-term vision of the future of the CAP after 2013 that: would allow it to benefit from the exceptional opportunity for expansion presented by the forecast that growth in global agri-food trade will be twice as fast as total expected growth in world trade over the coming three decades; would seek to ensure that agriculture development is uniform throughout the EU; and, through the combined efforts of the EU-15 and the new Member States, would enable agriculture to fulfil its role in terms of production and other activities; o o o 44. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the parliaments and governments of the Member States.
