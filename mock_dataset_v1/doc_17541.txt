to EUR 11,775 million, out of which EUR 3.925.000 remains available for 2006. The remaining amount has been allocated in the 2006 PDB and which does not have any margin available . See ANNEX for more details. Budget for 2006 7. The amount available for allocation in 2006 amounts to EUR 64.612.000. In several programmes, a decreasing budget profile has been chosen and the amount available for 2006 is smaller than in two previous years. This applies to youth, culture, and civic participation. For relations with third countries, the proposed amount for 2006 remains at the same level as in 2005, but is slightly lower than in 2004.
