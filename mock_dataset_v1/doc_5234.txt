the substantial weaknesses and failures of the Member States in the fields of C4ISR systems (command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance), greater progress in sensors systems, biotechnology, space and IT technology should be sought; 18. Notes that aerospace-related applications and services in fields such as global positioning, worldwide observation and data collection can play a crucial role and should be underlined in the ESRP; 19. Calls on the Commission to build on the report "Research for a Secure Europe" published by the Group of Personalities in the field of Security Research and on the final report of the Panel of Experts on Space and Security, to extend to national satellite initiatives the kind of cooperation and collaboration in security research that is necessary in order to maximise the capacity of civilian, military and dual-use systems and to meet the operational needs and requirements of the Union; 20. Recognises that additional and more appropriate funding will be needed for a coherent and effective security research programme; considers therefore that the funding level of EUR 1 000 million per year proposed by the Group of Personalities Report could be reached by making use of funding from the Framework Research Programme as well as from alternative sources; 21. Is of the view that in parallel to such funding level the Union should rationalise and make more efficient use of existing resources and eliminate current spending fragmentation; 22. Stresses however that increased investment in security research should not result in cuts in the civil research expenditure level; 23. Calls on the Council and the Commission to study a system of balanced sharing of expenditure on additional resources to be mobilised over and above those provided for in the Community research plan, in order to ensure that the burden of the cost of research takes account of the economic weight of individual Member States, based on a percentage of GNP, and to make commitments over a multi-annual period, enabling reliable planning to take place. Consultation and cooperation with stakeholders 24. Welcomes the suggested setting up of the European Security Research Advisory Board (ESRAB); considers that, given the current lack of a policy formulation superstructure, the need exists for clearer information on whether the Advisory Board will prove adequate and whether it will be ready to advise effectively on the content of security research and to address operational problems relating to programmes; underlines that
