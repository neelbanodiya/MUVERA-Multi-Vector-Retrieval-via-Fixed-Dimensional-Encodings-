WRITTEN QUESTION E-6252/08 by Andreas Mölzer (NI) to the Commission (20 November 2008) Subject: Crime by foreign offenders The public has for years been facing a steadily rising and increasingly brutal wave of crime by foreigners. Statistics show that the share of offenders from groups of foreigners is many times higher than that of the indigenous population. For instance almost 30 % of criminal offences in Austria are committed by foreigners, and around 40 % of prison inmates do not have Austrian nationality. Statistics also show that many convicted foreigners are not registered, meaning that they are people present in the EU illegally. In the media the origin of criminals is often omitted or only mentioned explicitly if those concerned are persons from the indigenous population. Moreover offenders of foreign origin who possess, for instance, a German passport are described as ‘German offenders’. If asylum‑seekers or foreigners turn to crime they are seldom or only temporarily deported. Crimes should be recorded irrespective of nationality, but if the statistics conceal foreign crime it is impossible to respond adequately to criminal tendencies. To persuade the public they are safe there is even recourse to sleight of hand. Thus for instance a large-scale fraud in Austria with 46 000 individual offences has reportedly been recorded as a single crime. 1. To what extent are criminal offences committed by foreigners or asylum-seekers recorded statistically in other EU Member States? 2. Is the Commission aware of statistical embellishment or incorrect data concerning criminal statistics in other EU countries, and if so, which? 3. Are there plans for standard guidelines in this area, to obtain comparable figures for criminal offences and crime throughout the EU and put an end to inconsistencies? 4. What measures are being planned by the EU or its Member States to improve ways of recognising and fighting crime trends?
