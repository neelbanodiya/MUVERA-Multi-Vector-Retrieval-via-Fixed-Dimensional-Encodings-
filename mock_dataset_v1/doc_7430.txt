Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (12 May 2006) The Commission fully respects the right of Member States to challenge its acts pursuant to Article 230 EC. Concerning the Pekao/BPH case to which the question refers, the Commission initiated two parallel procedures under Article 21 of the Merger Regulation Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (the EC Merger Regulation), OJ L 24, 29.1.2004. and Article 226 EC, in order to verify whether the actions taken by the Polish authorities (i) impinged on the Commission’s exclusive competence to assess mergers with a Community dimension under the Merger Regulation and (ii) violated the EC rules on free movement of capital and freedom of establishment. The Commission will carefully and impartially consider these issues, taking due account of the reply of the Polish authorities and the latest developments concerning the Pekao/BPH operation. More generally, the Commission would look with great concern on any possible unjustified interference in cross-border merger activity by national governments. As concerns the free movement of capital, the Commission will uphold the single market rules and will be tough against Member States who fail to implement correctly the provisions of EC sectoral legislation. As concerns individual mergers, the Commission will enforce the Merger Regulation in a fair, objective and coherent way. The Commission has the duty to enforce these rules accordingly wherever appropriate. As guardian of the EC Treaty, and as the institution responsible for merger control on competition grounds at the European level, the Commission is determined to guarantee that companies can effectively benefit from the advantages of the EU’s internal market. That is why enforcement of these provisions is, and will remain, one of the Commission’s central priorities.
