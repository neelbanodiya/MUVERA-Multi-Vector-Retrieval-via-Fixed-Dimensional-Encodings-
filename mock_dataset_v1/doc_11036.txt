Question for written answer E-001447/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Carlo Fidanza (PPE) (14 February 2012) Subject: ‘Lomellina rice plantations’ special protection zone Directive 92/43/EEC (the ‘Habitats Directive’) provides for the establishment of a European ecological network of special conservation zones named ‘Nature 2000’, which also includes special protection zones (SPZs) classified in accordance with Directive 79/409/EEC (the ‘Wild Birds Directive’), which has been replaced by Directive 2009/147/EC concerning the conservation of wild birds. Both Directives establish that the measures adopted must consider economic, social and cultural requirements in addition to specific regional and local aspects. In accordance with this legislation, the ‘Lomellina rice plantations’ special protection zone was set up, covering an area of 30 941 hectares of cultivated land, divided up into 22 different municipalities, making it the largest SPZ in Europe. Its designation is, however, in clear violation of the stated Directives, in that the area’s environment is man-made. Considering that the territory in question is Italy’s most important rice producer and one of the biggest in all of Europe, that in the province of Pavia, the Valle del Ticino park encompasses a surface area of 46 376 hectares, of which 11 620 fall under the SPZ ‘Ticino forests’, the ‘Lomellina rice plantations’ SPZ covers 30 941 hectares and the other SPZs or sites of Community importance (SCIs) make up 2 600 hectares, it therefore follows that approximately 80 000 hectares are subject to environmental restrictions, i.e. 45 % of the area usable for agriculture in the province. These restrictions significantly reduce rice productivity in these areas, with very negative repercussions on the territory and the socioeconomic fabric. Paragraph 4- bis of Article 3 of Presidential Decree No 357 of 8 September 1997, as amended by Presidential Decree No 120 of 12 March 2003, lays down that ‘the Regions […] carry out regular assessments of the suitability’ of the sites in terms of the implementation of the objectives of the directive and that, following that assessment, they may propose to the Ministry for the Protection of the Environment an update of the list of these sites, their boundaries and the contents of the related information sheets. Can the Commission state whether, on the basis of this data, it is willing to set up a forum with the Lombardy Region and the local authorities in order to verify the possibility of amending the boundaries and extent of the
