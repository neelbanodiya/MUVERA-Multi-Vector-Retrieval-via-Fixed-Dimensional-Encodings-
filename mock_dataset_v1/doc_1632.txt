Reply (12 September 2007) Regulation (EC) No 491/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 established a programme for financial and technical assistance to third countries in the areas of migration and asylum (Aeneas) OJ L 80, 18.3.2004, p. 1. . That cooperation programme, which began operating on 1 January 2004, aims at providing specific and complementary financial and technical aid for third countries in order to support their efforts to improve the management of migratory flows in all their dimensions. Included among the actions supported by the programme are the setting up of information campaigns and the provision of legal advice on the consequences of illegal immigration, trafficking in human beings and the smuggling of migrants, and clandestine employment in the European Union. On 18 December 2006, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 OJ L 378, 27.12.2006, p. 41. . That regulation, which established a financial instrument for development cooperation, will apply from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. With that instrument, the Community will be able to finance measures aimed at supporting cooperation with developing countries, including actions on migration and asylum. Discouraging illegal immigration and raising awareness of the risks related to it are among the actions which can be financed by that instrument.
