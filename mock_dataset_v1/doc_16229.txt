Question for written answer E-012578/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Kay Swinburne (ECR) (11 January 2012) Subject: Year of the Brain More than 127 million European citizens are thought to be affected by brain diseases, with the number expected to increase as the population ages. A lot of progress has already been made in increasing awareness and promoting brain research to improve the quality of life for those affected. To be launched, a European Year of the Brain needs to be proposed by the Commission. It would effectively increase the profile of all brain diseases across the EU and develop regional, national and European level plans to address specific areas relating to brain diseases. Would the Commission therefore be prepared to support making 2014 the European Year of the Brain?
