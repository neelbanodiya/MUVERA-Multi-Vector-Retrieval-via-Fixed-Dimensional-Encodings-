WRITTEN QUESTION P-4774/07 by Zuzana Roithová (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (27 September 2007) Subject: Social security regulation — assumption of cost of healthcare, whether in hospital or not, obtained in another Member State Social security arrangements for EU citizens moving to another Member State are not working properly. A patient living abroad who needs medical treatment has no certainty that the cost will be reimbursed if he is not aware of the ECJ decisions and will therefore choose to return to his home country for healthcare. This entails not just additional travel costs, but also affects the integrity of the family. The Commission has been asked to bring forward an amended text to the existing Regulations (EEC) No 1408/71 OJ L 149, 5.7.1971, p. 2 . or (EC) No 883/2004 OJ L 168, 30.4.2004, p. 1 . so that the ECJ decisions, which contradict the regulations, would be fully implemented. Instead, Parliament is dealing with amendments to the technical annexes (COM(2007)0159) or only implementation of the regulation (COM(2006)0016), without discussing the more than urgent topic of covering the cost of non-acute healthcare, both hospital and non-hospital, obtained in another Member State. This matter has also been withdrawn from the directive on Services. Half a billion EU citizens are waiting in vain for a change that would be in accordance with the ECJ decision and would reflect their rights. They cannot wait another year or more for a change to be made. 1. Can the Commission explain why it still has not submitted an amended version of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 or (EEC) No 1408/71, which is a sign of the institutions’ failure? 2. When will Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 be amended so that it could fully replace Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and satisfactorily regulate this unclear situation regarding the assumption of healthcare costs, without interfering with subsidiarity as far as health service organisation and financing is concerned?
