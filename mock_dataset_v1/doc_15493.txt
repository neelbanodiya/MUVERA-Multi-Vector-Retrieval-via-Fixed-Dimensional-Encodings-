WRITTEN QUESTION E-2391/04 by Ulrich Stockmann (PSE) to the Commission (7 October 2004) Subject: Financing of reinforced security measures at Community airports Together with the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 OJ L 355, 30.12.2002, p. 1 . , an interinstitutional declaration was made noting the European Commission’s intention to conduct a study on aviation security financing. The study is yet to be made available to the European Parliament. The release of this study is critical to help illustrate the huge burden of security costs that the aviation industry is bearing, which contrasts with the situation in the United States where the US administration has clearly recognised that the State has a role to play in protecting its citizens. Furthermore, the bulk of the study deals with the cost situation in 2002, which risks making the study seem out of date if not published soon. The European Commission has already stated that the EU Member States have a role to play in financing reinforced security measures against attacks directed at society as a whole (see Commission Communication on the repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States) and the European Parliament has also expressed its support by trying to amend what became Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 on civil aviation security to require EU Member States to undertake coordinated action to draw up a policy for financing and guaranteeing the highest possible level of civil aviation security. When will the Commission present the study to the European Parliament? What are Commission's plans as regards the financing of security measures at European airports? What are the Commission's plans to create a level playing field between the EU and the US aviation industry?
