Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (18 January 2006) Directive 97/67/EC Directive 97/67/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 on common rules for the development of the internal market of Community postal services and the improvement of quality of service, OJ L 15, 21.1.1998. , as amended, establishes a calendar for the progressive and gradual market opening of the postal markets. Article 26 of the directive expressly allows Member States to introduce measures which are more liberal than those provided in the directive. Some Member States, for instance Sweden, have already done so by proceeding to complete market opening, while some others such as the Netherlands or Germany have legal measures in place to proceed faster than envisaged in Directive 97/67/EC or are considering such an option. In this context, the decision whether to go beyond the calendar envisaged in the said directive belongs entirely to Member States. Regarding universal service obligation, Article 3 of the directive requires Member States to ensure that users of postal services enjoy the right to a universal service and lists the key elements which make up universal service. Member States are free to extend the range and scope of universal service if they wish but remain bound to guarantee the minimum requirements as set out in Article 3.
