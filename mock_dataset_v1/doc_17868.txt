Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (1 June 2007) The Commission has taken note of the adoption by the Ukrainian Parliament on 28 November 2006 of a resolution on the Ukrainian Great Famine of 1932-1933, the so-called ‘Holodomor’ (with a majority of 233 MPs out of 450). The law describes the Holodomor as genocide against the Ukrainian people and considers its public denial to be illegal. Please note that it does not pertain to the Commission’s competence to issue a legal or political judgment on the Great Famine in Ukraine, a historic event which precedes the creation of the European Communities.
