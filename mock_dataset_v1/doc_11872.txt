the EU; FLEGT licenses and legal frameworks 11. Recalls that a review of the legislative and regulatory framework governing the forestry sector is necessary in order to have a VPA which conforms with the objectives of the FLEGT action plan and to ensure that implementation of the VPA contributes to the environmental and social conventions and international agreements to which parties to a VPA are held; 12. Recalls that the VPAs also aim at improving social justice and respecting the rights of local and indigenous communities, thus including the principles of transparency and participation on an equal footing; 13. Recalls that these legislative improvements have to be completed before the FLEGT licences are issued; Implementation and rights of local population 14. Asks the Commission to present, within six months of the entry into force of any VPA, a report on the measures undertaken to ensure that the dialogue between the stakeholders and civil society, including the local and indigenous population, continues and is maintained during the implementation phase; takes the view that this report should include an assessment of the implications and real contributions of the content of the VPA in terms of the EU's international commitments and those of the signatory country regarding the environment and sustainable development, including the conservation and sustainable management of biodiversity resources; 15. Asks both parties to a VPA to ensure that civil society, local populations and indigenous peoples are able to contribute freely and confidently to the implementation and enforcement of the VPAs; is of the opinion that the Joint Agreement Implementation Committee should provide civil society, local populations and indigenous peoples' organisations with a right of complaint and then a right of appeal if unsuccessful; 16. Requests the Commission to ensure it has a good understanding of the current human rights situation in any potential VPA partner country and recommends that the Commission not engage with any country where there is no legal framework in place to protect basic human and social rights; reaffirms the need to have an open dialogue, freedom of speech – including freedom of religious belief – and freedom of the press in any country concerned by a VPAs, so that any potential complaints are heard; 17. Asks the Commission to produce and present to the Parliament, on a regular basis, a progress report on the implementation of the various provisions of all current and future VPAs; 18.
