Joint answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission Written questions : P-0051/05 , P-0096/05 (10 February 2005) The Greek authorities, in conformity with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 438/2001 Commission Regulation (EC) No 438/2001 of 2 March 2001 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 as regards the management and control systems for assistance granted under the Structural Funds, OJ L 63, 3.3.2001. provided a description of the management and control systems of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (2000‑06) established in Greece. The Directorate-General for Regional Policy analysed the description provided by the Greek authorities and concluded that those systems presented serious weaknesses. An audit mission carried out by the services of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy in October 2003 further confirmed that ‘important deficiencies remain and that the systems do not yet provide assurance for sound financial management of the ERDF during the programming period 2000‑06’. In the light of the detected deficiencies, an action plan was proposed to and agreed by the Greek authorities for amendments to the management and control system in relation to the ERDF (2000‑06). The final deadline for the implementation of the action plan and the submission of specific deliverables was 30 September 2004. The Commission analysed the work carried out in connection with the action plan and concluded that: — certain types of co‑financed operations (contracts of public works, supplies and services) and certain operations carried over from the Community support framework (CSF) II to CSF III do not justify part or the whole of the contribution from the ERDF (2000‑06) and; — there are important deficiencies in the management or control systems which lead to systemic irregularities, regarding ERDF. Furthermore, the Commission also considers that Greece has not yet fulfilled its obligation under Article 39.1 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/99 Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, OJ L 161, 26.6.1999. to investigate irregularities and to make the financial corrections required for all irregular expenditure already co‑financed by the ERDF. Therefore, in accordance with Article 39.2 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/99, the Director General of the Directorate-General for Regional Policy informed the Permanent Representation of Greece to the European Union (letter dated 22 December 2004) that the Member of the Commission responsible for Regional Policy intends to propose to the Commission
