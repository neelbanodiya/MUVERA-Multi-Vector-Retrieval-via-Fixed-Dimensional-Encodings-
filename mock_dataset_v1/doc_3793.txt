WRITTEN QUESTION E-1680/04 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 August 2004) Subject: Deterioration in housing, health and employment for the Roma in Slovakia and extra measures to reverse this trend 1. Is the Commission aware that for the large Roma community in Slovakia living in ghettos that resemble rubbish dumps without electricity, paved streets or jobs and which are major sources of disease, conditions are worsening rather than improving? 2. What will be the consequences of the fact that on its forthcoming accession to the EU Slovakia is in practice still not able to guarantee fundamental human rights for a large section of its population? 3. To what extent does the Commission consider that this sorry situation is attributable to the fact that Slovakia has put greater emphasis on economic criteria at the expense of social criteria in its effort to join the EU? 4. How many Roma does the Commission expect to migrate to the current EU Member States when restrictions on the employment of nationals of the new Member States are lifted? 5. What diseases does the Commission expect to spread within the EU if efforts are not made to improve these living conditions that are a breeding ground for disease? 6. Does the Commission agree with its representative in Slovakia that the country has satisfied all the conditions for accession? And, if this is in fact the case, does it mean that the Commission considers that rapid improvements are no longer required? 7. Is the Commission envisaging extra support measures, in addition to existing projects, to help reverse this unacceptable trend rapidly and allow Roma in Slovakia effectively to obtain the status of equal citizens within five years?
