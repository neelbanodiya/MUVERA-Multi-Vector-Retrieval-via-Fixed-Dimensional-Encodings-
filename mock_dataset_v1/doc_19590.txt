WRITTEN QUESTION E-0849/06 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) , Karin Scheele (PSE) , Carlos Carnero González (PSE) and Iratxe García Pérez (PSE) to the Council (2 March 2006) Subject: El Mami Amar Salem, Saharawi human rights activist El Mami Amar Salem, President of the Committee against Torture in Dajla, was arrested and tortured because he took part in demonstrations held in Dajla (formerly Villa Cisneros) on the night of 3 February 2006. This human rights activist was held with six other Saharawi human rights activists during the demonstrations of 3 February. The Moroccan occupying forces took brutal action against the demonstrators, seriously injuring other activists belonging to the Committee against Torture in Dajla in addition to El Mami Amar Salem, such as Uld Chej El Mahyub, Miska Ahmed Zein, Hamadi Ahmed Benhanun, Mohamed Brahim Machnan, Ahmed Bahia and Wanna Beida. The Saharawi Committee against Torture in Dajla was set up in September 2004 to break the media blackout imposed by the Moroccan Government on Saharawi territory, according to the manifesto on the basis of which it was founded. For years the group focused its efforts on organising Saharawi civil action against the torture and human rights violations committed by the Moroccan occupying forces in the occupied city of Dajla. Is the Council aware of these events? What steps will it take in response to the reports constantly coming in from Morocco regarding the persecution of those fighting for human rights?
