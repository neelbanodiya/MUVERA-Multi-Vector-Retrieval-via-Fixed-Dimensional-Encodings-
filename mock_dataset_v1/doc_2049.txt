Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (23 April 2007) The European Union has welcomed the recent formation of a Palestinian Government of National Unity, which lays the foundation for Palestinian reconciliation. The Commission will assess the actions of the new government and its ministers. It is willing to meet those ministers who accept the Quartet principles. In this context, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner met Minister of Finance Salaam Fayyad on 11 April 2007. The European Community and the EU Member States did not establish an aid embargo on the Palestinian territories in 2006. In fact, total EU assistance to the Palestinian people reached EUR 700 million in that year, of which EUR 340 million from the Community budget. In 2007, the Commission has already committed EUR 172 million for the Palestinians, partly through the Temporary International Mechanism (TIM). The European Union is committed to continuing the TIM until the financial situation and future needs can be assessed and a more sustainable framework for assistance can be established. The Commission is ready to resume cooperation with the PA government by offering technical assistance, starting with the Ministry of Finance. The Commission will consider resuming direct financial assistance only when all necessary political and technical conditions are met.
