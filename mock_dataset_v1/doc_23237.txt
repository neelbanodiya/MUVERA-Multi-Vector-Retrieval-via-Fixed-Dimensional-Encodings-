interpretations of EC Directive 2004/38 as far as the criteria for qualifying for permanent residence are concerned, problems encountered by petitioners in exercising their voting rights or having their qualifications recognised. On several occasions, the Committee recommended petitioners to use SOLVIT, an informal mechanism which can provide efficient solutions within strict deadlines. One should stress that restrictions related to the data protection prevent the Committee from re-directing petitions to SOLVIT itself and therefore can only advise the petitioner on this matter. It is therefore up to the petitioner whether to use it or not and whether to communicate to the Committee the outcome of his or her eventual demarches to SOLVIT. Slight changes can also be observed in the ranking of the petitions by language: where in 2009 as in 2008 German and English remain the two main languages used by the petitioners, there was a switch of places between Italian and Spanish. Slovenian, Maltese and Estonian rank last. 2009 Language Number of petitions Percentage German 548 28.5 English 343 17.8 Spanish 237 12.3 Italian 203 10.6 Polish 116 6.0 Romanian 110 5.7 French 107 5.6 Others 260 13.5 2008 Language Number of petitions Percentage German 437 23.2 English 395 20.9 Italian 222 11.8 Spanish 193 10.2 Romanian 155 8.2 French 131 6.9 Polish 101 5.4 Greek 87 4.6 Others 165 8.7 By nationality, Germans remain the most active petitioners, followed by Spanish and Italians (also in this statistics, Spanish and Italians switched places as compared to 2008). Romanian, Polish and British petitioners come on the next places. On the last places one can find the Czech, Estonian and Luxemburgish citizens who submitted together eleven petitions in 2009. 2009 Prime petitioner nationality Number of petitions Percentage Deutschland 496 25.8 España 237 12.3 Italia 219 11.4 Romania 150 7.8 Poland 131 6.8 United Kingdom 121 6.3 France 79 4.1 Greece 78 4.1 Others 414 21.5 2008 Prime petitioner nationality Number of petitions Percentage Deutschland 412 21.8 Italia 245 12.9 España 197 10.4 Romania 189 10.0 United Kingdom 144 7.6 Poland 112 5.9 Greece 102 5.4 France 91 4.8 Others 400 21.1 As regards the format of petitions, one may speak of a confirmation: petitioners are more inclined to submit their petitions by using the internet form rather than the traditional letter-type format (62.6% of the petitions received in 2009 were sent via e-mail against 59.2 % in 2008). 2009 Petition Format
