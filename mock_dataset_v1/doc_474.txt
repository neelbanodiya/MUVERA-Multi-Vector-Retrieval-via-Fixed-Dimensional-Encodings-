Question for written answer E-4100/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (S&D) (11 June 2010) Subject: Creation of a European credit rating agency The European Union needs strong economic governance and growth to allow it to recover from the current crisis. Is the Commission not preparing to strengthen international efforts to tackle the important problems faced by the finance system? Particularly now, it is important to have a common, coordinated exit strategy. Does the Commission not think that a European credit rating agency should be set up as an alternative to the major private agencies?
