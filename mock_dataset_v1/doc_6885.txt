currently five WiMAX base stations installed, and the network is being commissioned (tested). The customer change-over, which is the final stage of the WiMAX deployment, will begin in April 2009. VoIP (voice over the Internet protocol) solution should be available to the residents of Black Valley in April. One to two customers will be set up each day, and all installations should be completed by the end of May 2009. The Commission expects that the measures referred to above will ensure that the residents of Black Valley have access to modern telecommunications services complying with the requirements of the Universal Service Directive. The Commission will again contact the Irish authorities in order to confirm the successful implementation of these measures in practice. In this context, it should be also noted that under the i2010 initiative of the Commission, Ireland, along with other Member States, has put its national broadband strategy in place. To this end, on 22 January 2009, the Irish Government announced the National Broadband Scheme to achieve its national objective by mobilising national, EU and private resources (estimated at a total of EUR 223 million) to roll-out broadband to the currently under-served rural areas, which cover around 10 % of the population and 33 % of the area of the country. According to this scheme, Ireland will have 100 % coverage by September 2010 and half of the area under the scheme will be covered by the end of 2009.
