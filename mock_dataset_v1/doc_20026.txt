Question for written answer E-001770/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 José Manuel Fernandes (PPE) (3 March 2011) Subject: Final destination of budgetary revenue arising in connection with CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles Regulation 443/2009 of 23 April 2009 sets emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community’s integrated approach to reducing CO 2 emissions from light-duty vehicles. A reliable control mechanism is required in order to ensure that vehicle manufacturers respect the ambitious goals set by the regulation. Article 9 thereof therefore provides for a system of premiums to be paid by vehicle manufacturers who produce cars with specific average CO 2 emissions above the level permitted by the regulation, for each calendar year from 2012 onwards. The Commission shall impose the premium on the manufacturer directly. Article (4) and Recital 27 stipulate that ‘the amounts of the excess emissions premium shall be considered as revenue from the general budget of the European Union’. 1. Has the Commission already adopted comitology rules establishing methods for the collection of excess emissions premiums, as provided for in Article 9(3) of the regulation? 2. Despite the fact that the system comes into force only on 1 January 2012, are there any estimates or forecasts available as to how much EU budgetary revenue these premiums will bring in? 3. How is the Commission going to incorporate this revenue into the general budget of the EU? Will this revenue contribute specifically to funding projects that come under the 20/20/20 environmental objectives?
