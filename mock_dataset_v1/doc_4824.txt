WRITTEN QUESTION E-1340/10 by Jacek Saryusz-Wolski (PPE) to the Commission (8 March 2010) Subject: European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument The Joint Declaration of the Prague Eastern Partnership Summit of 7 May 2009 aims at establishing a more ambitious partnership between the EU and the eastern neighbourhood countries. The eastern dimension of the European Neighbourhood Policy, namely the Eastern Partnership, was therefore developed. Its main objective is to create the necessary conditions in order to accelerate political association and provide additional impetus to the social and economic development of the partner countries. As stated in the Joint Declaration, the EU is to provide increased financial support in order to fulfil the goals of the Eastern Partnership. Bearing this in mind, and taking into account the need to provide greater financial support for the Eastern component of the ENPI, I would like to ask how the Commission sees the future after the 2013 distribution of resources between the Southern and Eastern components, in terms of fulfilling the Eastern Partnership commitments?
