2004/C 65 E/013 WRITTEN QUESTION P-3497/02 by Claude Moraes (PSE) to the Commission (2 December 2002) Subject: Human rights violations in Iran There is at present worldwide concern at the increasing violations of human rights in Iran, in particular cases of torture and cruelty and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including stoning, amputation and public executions. There is also evidence of increasing discrimination against religious minorities, in particular the ongoing persecution of the Bahai community. The undertaking of constructive dialogue with Iran could be complemented by a transparent and independent tool for monitoring and evaluating the human rights situation in the form of a Special Rapporteur to objectively evaluate progress. What specific steps are being taken to ensure Iran's progress in moving towards a more tolerant and peaceful society with a more open debate on human rights, and what plans are envisaged to effectively measure such advance? The EU has recently revived relations with Iran despite the US line undermining EU policy. It is commented that troops deployed by the US in the Persian Gulf and the use of economic sanctions puts Iran under perceived immediate threat and that under such circumstances it is not difficult for the radicals to find an audience. It could prove very difficult for the EU to reach out to reformers in Iran if the US is isolating and characterising Iran as being part of an axis of evil . What pressure is the EU putting on the US to reconsider its positions on a policy of isolation and sanctions towards Iran and engage in a more constructive dialogue with Iran as is the current policy of the EU?
