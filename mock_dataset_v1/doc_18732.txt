exclusively exempt financial and insurance services but regularly both, exempt and taxed services, the percentages of which vary according to the business model of the economic operator concerned. Therefore, also the operator's business model determining the percentage of taxed activities and the allocation of costs to these activities will impact on his right to deduct input VAT on such costs. Another factor which impacts on the operator's right to deduct input VAT is his client's place of establishment or the destination of the goods. Where the operator supplies insurance or financial services to customer established outside the Community or where those transactions relate directly to goods to be exported out of the Community, the operator is entitled to deduct input VAT in accordance with Article 169(c) of Directive 2006/112/EC. The Commission services cannot exclude that in particular cases Member States might grant a right to deduct in scenarios not covered by Community provisions. Where informed of such rules or practices the Commission will analyse whether they constitute an infringement of Community law. In considering initiatives on deduction rules in a wider perspective, reference should also be made to a Commission proposal to amend the VAT Directive COM(2007)677 final. and which contains, amongst other topics, rules in case certain goods are used for both taxed (thus creating a right of deduction) and non-taxed (with no right of deduction) purposes. The abovementioned proposals are still awaiting adoption by the Council but would be a step forward in improving the deduction system as a whole. After adoption by the Council, the Commission would of course carefully examine the implementation and the practical impact of these new rules in the Member States in order to determine if further initiatives would be required.
