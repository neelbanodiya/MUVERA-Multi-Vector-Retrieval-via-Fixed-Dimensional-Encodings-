9999/C Q999 E/013 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0868/04 by José Ribeiro e Castro (UEN) to the Commission (10 March 2004) Subject: Large families In its most recent report with a view to the Spring European Council, 'Delivering Lisbon - Reforms for the Enlarged Union' ( COM(2004) 29 final/2), the Commission pointed out (in point 2.4.1 on reinforcing social cohesion) that the phenomenon of poverty 'is very closely linked to unemployment as it affects 38% of the unemployed. Large families, elderly women living alone, and single-parent (71% of whom are women) families'. The European Council has set itself the aim of giving decisive impetus to reducing poverty by 2010 and the Commission has, to this end, campaigned on various occasions for the adoption of National Social Inclusion Strategies (see the Joint Report on Social Inclusion, which summarises the results of the examination of the National Action Plans for Social Inclusion (2003-2005) - COM(2003) 773 ). In this context, it points out that 'those living in large households with three or more dependent children are particularly exposed to income poverty risk, with Ireland, Italy, Spain and Portugal displaying the highest risk (between 34% and 49%, against a EU average of 27%)'. - Given that large families especially are particularly vulnerable and exposed to the risk of poverty, what measures has the Commission suggested that Member States take to remedy this problem and promote full implementation of the Lisbon Strategy for all? Does the Commission agree that this particularly vulnerable status is partly due to the fact that many social policies and some aspects of tax policies are devised for individuals or two-person households, thereby creating objective discrimination against families, who are penalised systematically and in proportion to their size? - Does the Commission intend to instruct its services to carry out a study and submit proposals for the definition of more effective solutions and, in particular, to aim at transversal promotion of the sharing of best practice? Does the Commission consider it appropriate to adopt Community-wide measures through the open coordination method? .
