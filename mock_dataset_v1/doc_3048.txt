WRITTEN QUESTION P-4702/05 by Marie-Noëlle Lienemann (PSE) to the Commission (7 December 2005) Subject: Postponement of the Statute for a European Mutual Society Why has the Commission decided to postpone the proposal for a regulation on the Statute for a European Mutual Society? This indefinite postponement will consequently lead to the long-term disappearance of mutual interest societies in the European Union, despite the fact that mutual associations contribute to the European social model, which is a fixed objective of the Lisbon Strategy.
