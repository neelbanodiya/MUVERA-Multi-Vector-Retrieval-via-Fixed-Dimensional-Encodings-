9999/C Q999 E/010 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0614/04 by Harlem Désir (PSE) to the Commission (19 February 2004) Subject: Closure of the 280-employee DHL site at Blanc Mesnil (France) At the start of 2004, news was leaked to the 280 employees of the small-package carrier DHL France (a subsidiary of the European consortium Deutsche Post World Net [DPWN]) that the DHL site at Blanc Mesnil was to close and that a total of 1200 jobs at several centres in France would be lost. Only after the workers went on strike at the end of January 2004 did the company managers confirm their intentions by means of a supposedly 'confidential' circular. It would appear that DPWN has drawn up a job-abolition and collective-redundancy plan which contravenes Community legislation, in particular Council Directive 94/45/EC OJ L 254, 30.9.1994, p. 64 of 22 September 1994 on European works councils, which stipulates that 'certain decisions having a significant effect on the interests of employees must be the subject of information and consultation of the employees' appointed representatives as soon as possible.'

Pursuant to Directive 2002/14/EC OJ L 80, 23.3.2002, p. 29 of 11 March 2002, which is currently being transposed, 'timely information and consultation is a prerequisite for the success of the restructuring and adaptation of undertakings', and 'information shall be given at such time, in such fashion and with such content as are appropriate to enable, in particular, employees' representatives to conduct an
