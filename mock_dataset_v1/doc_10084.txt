Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (14 September 2011) The Commission would like to underline that the additional funding of EUR 35 per inhabitant per year in the programming period 2007-2013 covers both the outermost regions and the northern sparsely populated regions See Article 20 of Annex I of Council Regulation (EC) 1083/2006. . Consequently, the proposal of the Commission of additional funding for the outermost regions as well as for the northern sparsely populated regions for the next multi-annual financial framework 2014-2020 See COM(2011) 500 final. is fully in line with the current situation. The slight reduction in the funding of the outermost regions and of the northern sparsely populated regions is related to the overall decrease of the cohesion budget. Whereas the budget of cohesion policy in 2007-2013 amounts to EUR 354.8 billion (expressed in 2011 prices), the proposal of the Commission for the period 2014-2020 amounts to EUR 336 billion (excluding the new Connecting Europe Facility), i.e. a decrease of EUR 19 billion. The level of future cohesion funding for the Canary Islands is still unclear. According to the Commission proposal and on the basis of the latest GDP/head figures, the Canary Islands, apart from this special allocation, would also benefit from EU support for more developed regions as of 2014. However, the funding volume and its distribution are still subject to negotiations in Council and Parliament.
