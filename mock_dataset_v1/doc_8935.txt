Question for written answer E-3991/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Georgios Papanikolaou (PPE) (7 June 2010) Subject: The Greek ‘Heraclitus II’ programme for research and technology If the national economies, and the Greek economy in particular, are to find a way out of the financial crisis, products and services have to be made more competitive. This was, moreover, discussed at the meeting of ministers with portfolios for research at the EU Competitiveness Council in Brussels on 26 May 2010. One of the ways proposed was to increase investment in research and technology. In Greece, at the close of 2008, the Ministry announced the launch of the ‘Heraclitus II’ programme, worth EUR 38 million and jointly financed by the EU, for doctoral theses in the context of the country's university research programmes. Unfortunately, so far there has been no assessment of the proposals submitted. At the same time thousands of young researchers are carrying out their research work awaiting the start of the programme, deprived of the necessary financial resources. I ask the Commission: 1. Is there a risk that the ‘Heraclitus II’ programme may be cancelled due to the attendant delay and divergence from the timetable set by the EU? 2. How can transparency be assured in the procedure for evaluating and selecting the proposals submitted?
