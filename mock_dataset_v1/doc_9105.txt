report to the discharge authority on the results of the mid-term review of that agreement, due in 2011; 6. Notes the efforts in the area of interinstitutional cooperation, in particular, the ongoing introduction of the staff management system ’Sysper2’, and the preparations carried out to that effect; 7. Notes that the Internal Audit Service (IAS) carried out audits on the adequacy of budget planning systems (concluded in 2009), and on the conformity of rights establishment in progress, as well as follow-ups on mission expenses, on studies and expert advice, and the second follow-up on application of internal control standards and adequacy of financial circuits; notes that as regards the latter, despite this being the second follow-up, it still demonstrated a relatively low result indicator (i.e. the number of recommendations implemented within 12 months); also notes that the planned study on the quality of the IAS function did not take place; 8. Reconfirms its position that, in the interests of transparency, declarations of financial interests of members of all Union institutions should be accessible on the Internet via a public register; reminds the CoR of its request that CoR members declare their financial interests, disclosing relevant information on declarable professional activities and remunerated posts or activities; notes with satisfaction the CoR response on the matter, in particular, the letter of the president of the CoR of 11 February 2011; requests the CoR to follow up this issue in its Annual Activity Report; 9. Commends the CoR for the consistently high quality of its Annual Activity Reports, and welcomes the inclusion of the follow-up to the Parliament's previous discharge decisions. 10. Calls on the CoR to undertake urgently during 2011 a comprehensive spending review of all areas of activity to ensure all expenditure is delivering value for money in order to identify possible savings which would reduce the pressure on the budget in this period of austerity.
