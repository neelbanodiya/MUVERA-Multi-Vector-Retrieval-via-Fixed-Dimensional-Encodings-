WRITTEN QUESTION E-1564/06 by Gitte Seeberg (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 April 2006) Subject: Animal transport In 2004, new rules were adopted for the transportation of animals in the EU, which also implemented new provisions for transport by sea, though these are not on a par with the most stringent standards applied, such as those in Australia. The new EU rules dating from 2004 contain no clear provisions for their proper enforcement and they are therefore currently applied very unevenly and, in some countries, inadequately. Some Member States focus only on hygiene and not on whether the ship's facilities are suitable for animal transport. These aspects are not dealt with directly in the Commission's proposal of 20 January 2006 for an action plan to improve animal welfare in the EU. In the light of the above, will the Commission say what steps it is taking to ensure that Member States comply with the applicable rules? Will the Commission's action plan to improve animal welfare cover effective enforcement in the Member States in regard to the transport by sea of live animals?
