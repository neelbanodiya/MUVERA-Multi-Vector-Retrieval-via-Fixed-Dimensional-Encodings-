Restrictions on the Marketing and Use of Dangerous Substances Frédérique RIES (ELDR, B) Report on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council directive amending for the 24th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (pentabromodiphenyl ether, octabromodiphenyl ether) (PE-CONS 3664/2002 – C5-0500/2002 – 2001/0018(COD)) Doc.: A5-0437/2002 Procedure : Codecision procedure (3rd reading) Debate : 17.12.2002 Frédérique RIES (ELDR, B) will be recommending approval of a conciliation agreement between Parliament and Council on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations. The aim of the present proposal is to provide for a ban on the marketing and use of pentabromodiphenyl ether (pentaBDE). PentaBDE is a brominated flame retarder which is used almost exclusively in the manufacture of flexible polyurethane foam for furniture and upholstery. The European Parliament adopted at its second reading a total of four amendments which aim, in particular, at an extension of the scope of the directive to cover all polybromodiphenyl ethers on the market. The amendments adopted provide for a ban not only for pentaBDE but also for actaBDE and decaBDE. Following a series of trilogue meetings with the Danish Council Presidency and the Commission an agreement was reached which covers the following elements: - an immediate ban on the marketing of octaBDE and - as the results of the risk reduction strategy for decaBDE
