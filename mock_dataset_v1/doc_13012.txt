Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (20 December 2006) The new common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector maintains the legal status of the quotas, which constitute a mechanism for regulating the market in the sugar sector. Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector OJ L 58, 28.2.2006 . fixes the quotas for the production on sugar, isoglucose and inulin syrup at a national or regional level and authorises Member States to allocate a quota to each approved undertaking established in its territory which is producing sugar, isoglucose or inulin syrup. There is no possibility to allocate this quota to growers of sugar beet. In the current legal framework, a transfer of quota between Member States is not possible.
