Question for written answer E-000445/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (23 January 2012) Subject: The cost of Energy Performance Certificates The economic crisis in Greece, which is fuelled by the policies of the Memoranda, has also led to a major crisis in the housing sector. House construction has come to a complete halt, with thousands of residential dwellings and commercial premises remaining unlet, leading to a dangerous and dramatic fall in their value. At the same time, home ownership is being penalised through the imposition of ever more taxes and special charges, primarily targeting the small homeowner. The cost of obtaining an Energy Performance Certificate, at this time and under these conditions, is placing an even greater burden on home ownership, given that Article 13 of Presidential Decree 100/2001 imposes a minimum remuneration for energy inspectors starting from EUR 150 for an apartment of 50 square metres and above, and rising to EUR 300 for commercial outlets of 50 square metres and above. In view of this: 1. Could the Commission agree to the request by homeowner associations for postponement of this measure, so as to afford some relief to the average homeowner, if this were also requested by the Greek Government? 2. What view does it take of the minimum compulsory remuneration for energy performance inspectors imposed by Article 13 of Presidential Decree 100/2010, a measure which places disproportionate burdens in the first instance on many small homes and business premises?
