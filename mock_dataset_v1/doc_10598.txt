EU's 20 % energy saving target. If the EU delivers on its current policies, including its commitment to reach 20 % renewables, and achieve 20 % energy efficiency by 2020, this would enable the EU to outperform the current 20 % GHG emission reduction target and achieve a 25 % GHG reduction by 2020. Lastly, the cause of climate change is the release of GHG in the atmosphere, a negative externality that imposes significant costs on a global scale, and which has so far been insufficiently internalized in economic systems, whatever economic model is followed in the various countries.
