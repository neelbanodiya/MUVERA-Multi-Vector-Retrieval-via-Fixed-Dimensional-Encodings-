WRITTEN QUESTION E-0411/09 by Roberta Angelilli (UEN) to the Commission (2 February 2009) Subject: Information on the use of funds from the Daphne II programme by the municipality of Pisa The European Union’s financial framework for 2007‑2013 includes many programmes aimed at supporting Community policies in a range of fields, such as research and technological development, training programmes, the promotion of culture, the environment, transport, energy and health and consumer protection. Specifically, the municipality of Pisa (Tuscany) appears to be particularly in need of European funding in order to prevent and combat all forms of violence occurring in the public or private domain against children, young people and women. In the light of the above, can the Commission indicate: 1. whether the municipality of Pisa has submitted any projects under the Daphne II programme? 2. whether that municipality obtained funding and, if not, on what grounds it was refused? 3. if funds were obtained, whether they were used within the stipulated period and, if not, whether the Commission has asked for the sums granted to be repaid?
