Answer given by Mrs Kroes on behalf of the Commission (18 June 2008) Various allegations of undue influence by interested companies on the decision making of national standard-setting organisations with regard to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/ the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 29500 standardisation process have been brought to the Commission's attention since the autumn of 2007. The Commission has consequently made enquiries with the European Economic Area (EEA's) national standardisation organisations about these allegations in order to investigate possible anti-competitive effects of such incidents. This investigation is ongoing and the Commission has not yet drawn any conclusions. It should be noted that the Commission's investigation focusses on possible anti-competitive behaviour of companies in the standard setting process. The Commission does not have the intention to review the national rules and arrangements governing standard-setting organisations. It is primarily the responsibility of Member States to ensure that the standard-setting process on national level is based on properly working rules. As regards the question of whether an additional standard format for electronic documents is needed or not, the Commission considers that this question is best decided in an open and transparent standard-setting process. Finally, the Commission understands that ISO members under ISO rules have the opportunity to file appeals against decisions. It is therefore up to the indivdual ISO members who participated in the vote on ISO/IEC 29500 to decide whether to appeal the decision taken by ISO or not.
