WRITTEN QUESTION E-0796/10 by Daciana Octavia Sârbu (S&D) to the Commission (22 February 2010) Subject: Translation and interpreting services for victims in court proceedings Extensive translation and interpreting services are to be made available for suspects and accused persons who face criminal charges and court proceedings in Member States. Are there similar plans to provide such services to victims of crimes? Victims are usually provided with real-time translation when they are giving evidence, but they do not necessarily have translation for the duration of the proceedings or access to full translation of court documents (e.g. those submitted as evidence) or other relevant material and information. Does the Commission recognise this problem? What action has the Commission taken — or will it take — to ensure that victims of crime who are required to participate in court proceedings have full access to translation and interpretation facilities?
