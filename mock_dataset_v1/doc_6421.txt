9999/C Q999 E/080 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1303/04 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (20 April 2004) Subject: Publicly clarifying responsibility for Phare projects in Bulgaria and measures to prevent unnecessary delays or cancellations 1. On what basis does the Commission come to the conclusion in its answer to written questions E-3972-3973/03 and E-4011-4014/03 OJ C of 25 February 2004 that the Bulgarian authorities are responsible for the delays and cancelled components of the civil society development project BG 0104.03, despite the fact that in Bulgaria it is claimed that final decisions on all matters are taken by the EU delegation? 2. In the Commission's view, was the officer responsible in the EU delegation in Sofia authorised to delay setting up the project steering group from December 2001 until September 2003? What was the reason for the postponement? 3. Did the Commission feel that a project steering group should have been set up in good time or did it deliberately leave decisions in this matter to one person in the EU delegation for 20 months? Why did the Commission decide to proceed in this way, or does it consider that it is not responsible for the actions of the EU delegation? 4. Was the Commission surprised by the 15-month delay in implementation of the project? 5. Why was the second phase of the subsidy for component II (regional competitions for local NGOs) not implemented? 6. What does the Commission think about the reservations expressed by the Bulgarian civil society sector that similar organisations have not been treated equally because in competitions for EU funding of projects outside Sofia during the last four to five years the Commission has always worked with the same small group of NGOs which had established good relations with the EU delegation's civil society adviser? 7. What measures have since been taken or are now being taken by the EU delegation in Sofia to prevent delays or partial cancellations in the implementation of future EU programmes to strengthen civil society in Bulgaria?
