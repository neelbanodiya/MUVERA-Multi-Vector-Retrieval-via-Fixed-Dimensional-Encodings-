Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (26 October 2005) Replying to the question submitted by the Honourable Member requires drawing a distinction between the phased registration period, as defined in recital 12 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 874/2004 of 28 April 2004 laying down public policy rules concerning the implementation and functions of the ‘.eu top level domain (TLD)’ and the principles governing registration O.J. L 162, 30.4.2004. , and the phase preceding the beginning of the phased registration period. Once the phased registration begins, registration of the ISO 639 three letter codes with the purpose of creating Community language second-level domains will be possible for holders of prior rights and public bodies under some specific conditions. Furthermore, upon completion of the phased registration, registration of these codes will be possible for anyone eligible under Article 4.2(b) of Regulation (EC) No 733/2002 of the Parliament and of the Council of 22 April 2002 on the implementation of the ‘.eu TLD’ OJ L 113, 30.4.2002 . , insofar as these codes are still available. Requests for registration during the phased registration and beyond will be subject to general the first-come first-served principle. Prior to the beginning of the phased registration, only the types of names contemplated in Articles 7 to 9 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 874/2004 can be the subject of a request for registration or a reservation. The three-letter codes of the ISO International Organisation for Standardisation. 639 list are not amongst the names contemplated by the abovementioned provisions, so that anyone (including Community institutions) is prevented from either requesting registration or otherwise reserving those codes under the ‘.eu TLD’ Top level domain. prior to the beginning of the phased registration.
