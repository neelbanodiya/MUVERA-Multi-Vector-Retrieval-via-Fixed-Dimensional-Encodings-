by 2010; welcomes the initiative taken in Johannesburg by the Commission and the Member States to launch a like-minded countries' renewables initiative and asks for a regular reporting to Parliament on the follow-up given to this initiative; 12. Expresses its concerns that although the challenges the world faces have been described, the necessary determination to achieve a common action does not expressly recognise the contribution of science and technology in sustainable development and more particularly does not promote a better understanding of links between environment and technological developments; 13. Regrets that no real efforts were made to agree on a plan to assist developing countries in their efforts to support technology leapfrogging, notably in relation to energy production, transportation, agriculture, waste management and chemicals, thereby making it possible to bypass particularly polluting steps in the modernisation process; 14. Further regrets the insufficiently strong commitment to tackle the loss of world biodiversity and the weak formula that was agreed of "achievement by 2010 of a significant reduction in the current rate of loss"; regrets that a further statement as to the need to curb habitat destruction and the loss of biodiversity was not made; 15. Notes the announcement of a large number of so-called 'type 2' partnership agreements involving both public and private initiatives, including energy and water initiatives put forward by the European Union; considers that such agreements can make a contribution to meeting sustainable development objectives but that they need to be carefully monitored and followed up in terms of assessment of their impact and added value, thus ensuring full accountability of all participants in such agreements; these agreements should in all cases complement and not replace other international actions; regrets that Parliament was not more closely consulted during the drafting process of these two partnership initiatives; asks the Commission to produce and to make available to Parliament an annual report on the water and energy partnerships, with a first report being presented in December 2002; 16.
