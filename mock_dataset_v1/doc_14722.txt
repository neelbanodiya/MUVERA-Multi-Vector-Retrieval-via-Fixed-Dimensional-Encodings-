Answer given by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2012) There are very high murder and crime rates in Venezuela — the highest in South America — and the registered trend of daily homicides number is on the rise. The figures are higher in urban areas such as Caracas and Maracaibo. The EU is working closely with its Member States both locally and in capitals, but is not aware that specific nationals are being targeted. The EU has raised its concern with the Venezuelan authorities and will continue to do so. This is however an area where progress is likely to be slow and will require reducing impunity and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the security forces. While the protection of citizens remains a competence of the host country, and travel advice to foreigners is being issued by the national authorities, two Regional Security Officers have been despatched to the EU Delegation in Venezuela to assess the security situation.
