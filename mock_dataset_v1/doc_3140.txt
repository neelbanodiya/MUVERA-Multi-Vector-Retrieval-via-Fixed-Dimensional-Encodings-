2002/C 205 E/258 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0911/02 by Hiltrud Breyer (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (8 April 2002) Subject: Marketing of noni products The marketing of noni products is at present being treated differently in the different Member States. In Germany in particular, products produced on a 100 %-natural basis from the fruit (morinda citrifolia) and bio-certified under EU law are being declared ineligible for marketing on the grounds that they contravene Novel Foods Regulation (EC) No 258/97 OJ L 43, 14.2.1997, p. 1 . and have not been approved. The German health authorities in particular assert that there is an increased risk of toxic and allergic reactions. Other EU Member States permit noni products to be marketed without restriction regardless of quality level. It remains uncontested in that connection that bio-certified noni products have been produced by traditional reproduction or growing methods. At issue is their suitability as food products, although it is known that in the USA in particular large quantities of noni products have been marketed for many years with no evidence of toxic or allergic reactions hitherto. 1. How does the Commission explain the discrepancy between approval as a bio-certified food product and the withholding of approval under the Novel Foods Regulation for one and the same product? 2. What is the Commission's own information hitherto about the apparent risk of consuming noni products?
