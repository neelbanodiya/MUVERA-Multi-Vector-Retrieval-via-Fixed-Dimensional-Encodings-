WRITTEN QUESTION E-4793/07 by Tokia Saïfi (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (2 October 2007) Subject: Reciprocal access to public contracts The European market is one of the most open and competitive markets in the world. It is therefore essential that, in a global system, our commercial partners’ markets meet the same standards. Reciprocity will ensure a fair and equitable commercial system. It is this point which brings us to the question of reciprocal access to public contracts. A number of third countries block access for European companies to their public contracts, and yet if companies from those countries are based in Europe they can have access to public contracts throughout the European Union. This is true inter alia of the energy, transport, water and telecommunications sectors, areas in which Europe boasts highly successful companies that are often world leaders in their fields. It seems to me that the EU should be able to demand genuinely reciprocal opening of public contracts. In the Commission’s opinion, what means of applying pressure could the EU use in this regard? What is the European Commission’s position on the implementation of carefully targeted restrictions that could persuade our partners (excluding developing countries) to enter into negotiations on market access? What is the European Commission’s position on the External Procurement Instrument?
