MEPs also set ambitious goals for CO2 emissions from cars and required fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions caused by extraction or cultivation, transport and distribution, processing and combustion of transport fuels. Revision of the Emission Trading System: further reductions The EP adopted a directive reforming the system that allows for trading of polluting rights. The directive aims to reduce emissions of sectors included in the scheme by 21% from 2005 levels. The revised directive establishes auctioning from 2013 in principle but includes several exceptions for example to take into account some new Member States' dependence on coal. Free allocation will end in 2020. Sectors covered include, among others, power stations, refineries, coke ovens, ceramics, cement, glass, metal ore, iron, steel, pulp, paper. Directive adopted by EP: 17.12.2008 Applicable progressively from: 1 January 2013 Reducing emissions from road transport and other sectors The "effort sharing" decision sets binding national targets for each EU Member State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from non-ETS sources (e.g. road and sea transport, buildings, services, agriculture and smaller industrial installations), between 2013 and 2020. These sources currently account for about 60% of all EU greenhouse gas emissions. The decision aims to reduce these emissions by 10% overall between 2013 and 2020. The effort sharing decision is the first of its kind worldwide. Decision adopted by EP: 17.12.2008 Equipping power plants to store CO2 underground Parliament also approved a proposed directive providing the legal framework for the new carbon dioxide capture and storage technology (CCS). To cut their CO2 emissions, industrial installations and power plants could in future
