Europe's wind turbine manufacturers and associated industries through the on-going promotion of energy from renewable sources at EU level; points in this respect to the mandatory national targets for the use of renewable energy by 2020, the European Industrial Initiative on Wind Energy prioritising the development the offshore wind technology In 2009 and in 2010, offshore wind technology noted 50% increase in market share compared to 2008 and 2009. and the projections COM(2011)0031 final stipulating a faster grow than in the past of renewable energy share in the EU in the years up to 2020 with wind power accounting for 27% of projected increase in renewable energy consumption (two-thirds onshore, one-third offshore); 6. Regrets in this respect that no information is available as to the extend to which the potential and future needs of the EU wind energy market has been taken into consideration in the decision on the closure of the plants in Lunderskov and Hammelev; deplores a total lack of consistency in the EU's objectives and industrial strategy; expresses concern about this particular relocation and points out the risk of importation of wind turbines produced in China to the European market; 7. Stresses in this case the paradoxical situation where Member States' commitments to fight climate change don't pay off for their companies to the same extent as they do for their global competitors, meaning that they are currently not sufficiently integrated in the Union's industrial strategy; 8. Welcomes the proposed co-ordinated package of personalised services which is built around three pillars: basic course and clarification (to identify individual skills), education and training (in several sectors linked to the local economy) and incentives of business start-ups; 9. Welcomes the fact that the package for dismissed workers was agreed with the local social partners and education institutions and, therefore, is adapted to the local needs and to existing or emerging alternative employment sources in the region.
