a new definition for detergents is needed to cover equivalent uses and be in line with developments at Member State level. (4) It is necessary to introduce a surfactant definition, which was lacking in the existing legislation. (5) It is important to give a clear and precise description of the relevant types of biodegradability. (6) Measures concerning detergents should be adopted to ensure the functioning of the internal market and avoid restricting competition in the Community. 7) as confirmed by the Commission White Paper on the strategy for a future Chemical Policy, appropriate measures concerning detergents should ensure a high level of environmental protection, especially of the aquatic environment. 8) detergents are already subject to certain Community provisions concerning their manufacture, proper handling, usage and labelling, in particular with reference to Commission Recommendation 89/542/EEC and Commission Recommendation 98/480/EC of 22 July 1998 concerning good environmental practice for household laundry detergents OJ L 215, 1.8.1998, p. 73. ; Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations OJ L 200, 30.7.1999, p. 1. Directive as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ L 284, 31.10.2003, p. 1). applies to detergents. (9) Ditallow-dimethyl-ammonium-chloride (DTDMAC) and nonylphenol (including ethoxylates derivatives-APEs) are priority substances undergoing at Community level risk assessment activities, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 of 23 March 1993 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances OJ L 84, 5.4.1993, p. 1. Regulation as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1882/2003. , and if necessary adequate strategies to limit the risks of exposure to these substances should therefore be recommended and implemented in the framework of other Community provisions. 10) the existing legislation on biodegradability of surfactants in detergents only covers primary biodegradability Directives 73/404/EEC and 86/94/EEC. and it is only applicable to anionic Directives 73/405/EEC and 82/243/EEC. and non-ionic Directive 82/242/EEC. surfactants; therefore it should be replaced by new legislation, which lays the main emphasis on ultimate biodegradability and meets the important concerns related to the potential toxicity of persistent metabolites. 11) this requires the introduction of a new set of tests based on EN ISO standards and OECD guidelines, which governs the granting of direct permission for
