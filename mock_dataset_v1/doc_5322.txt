ORAL QUESTION H-1142/05 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Georgios Karatzaferis to the Commission Subject: Suspension of benefit by OAED to Greek citizens of Pomak origin According to the Greek press, the Greek Manpower Employment Organisation (OAED) appears not to be paying some 500 unemployed workers (of Pomak origin) their seasonal benefit of € 740 which workers at the Perama shipyard and repair zone receive once a year. All the Pomaks are Greek Muslim citizens born in Greek Thrace and this decision has provoked a strong reaction from five trade unions in the 'zone', which are talking in terms of 'racist treatment of the unemployed by the government and the OAED administration'. Most of the Pomaks are sandblasters who submitted their supporting documents in the normal way through the trade unions, while the benefit is allegedly being paid only to those with Christian names. A trade union delegation has already made representations to the Governor of the OAED, Mr Vernadakis. How can the Commission intervene to remedy this unprecedented injustice, with its abhorrent racist connotations, against Greek citizens whom Turkey has tried so oppressively to 'appropriate' for years through the tactics of its consulate in Thrace?
