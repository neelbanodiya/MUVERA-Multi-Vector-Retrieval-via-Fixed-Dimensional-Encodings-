Question for written answer E-002640/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (21 March 2011) Subject: Purchase and dismantling of European companies by China According to Italian intelligence reports, the number one threat among the growing challenges we currently have to face is the attack on European private companies by countries in the Far East, particularly China. More specifically, the reports condemn the attempts being made to deplete our technological assets and change market conditions, especially in the fields of communications and electronics. It is a radical strategy that is taking advantage of the economic crisis — to purchase Italian companies not to re-launch them, but rather to study their technological know-how, steal their accumulated knowledge and technical skills and transfer them to China. That said, does the Commission not think it might be opportune to create a monitoring and authorisation mechanism for foreign investment in order to safeguard the strategic interests of EU Member States?
