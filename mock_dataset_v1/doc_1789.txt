rural development and/or food security as focal sectors of cooperation. In at least 23 African countries (including Ivory Coast) will there be close cooperation in these sectors in the next couple of years. The budgetary resources of the 2007‑10 Food Security Thematic Programme will also be used with the same overall target of increasing agricultural output and food security in the most affected countries. The high food prices crisis will be subject of debate at various high-level events in the next few weeks. This will include a discussion in the General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) of 26-27 May 2008, a high-level event on the world food security at the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), Rome, 3-5 June 2008, a discussion in the European Council of 16-17 June 2008, and a discussion in the G8, 7-9 July 2008. These events provide adequate opportunity to develop a well coordinated EU position on short, medium and long-term response to the food price challenges.
