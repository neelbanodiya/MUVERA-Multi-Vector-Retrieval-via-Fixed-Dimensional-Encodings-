ORAL QUESTION H-0452/06 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Cristobal Montoro Romero to the Council Subject: The European Union's current situation and the extension of the Euro zone Given the current difficult situation in the European Union, following the rejection of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe in certain Member States, the adoption of protectionist measures by certain governments, the reservations being displayed when it comes to reaching agreement on improving the operation of the internal market, or the fact that Europe is registering the lowest growth rate at world level, at a time of international economic expansion, Does the Council see it as positive that there should be the largest possible number of countries aspiring to form part of the Euro zone if their economies combine both high growth rates and macro-economic stability with streamlined public finances? Does the Council think it would be counterproductive for European integration to implement a restrictive interpretation of the convergence criteria established in Maastricht?
