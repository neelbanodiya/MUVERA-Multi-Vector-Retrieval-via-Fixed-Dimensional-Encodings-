Answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission (14 October 2011) The core network as included in the Commission draft proposal for new TEN‑T Guidelines is the outcome of a commonly agreed methodology which has been presented in February 2011 to the Parliament and the Council Commission Staff Working Document ‘The New Trans-European Transport Network Policy: Planning and implementation issues’, SEC(2011)101. . The core network has been designed in accordance with a two-step methodology: 1. the identification of urban main nodes, ports outside these nodes which exceed a certain volume threshold or fulfil certain geographical criteria, and the most relevant border crossing points. 2. connecting the main nodes identified in the first step by multimodal links, taking into account effectiveness and efficiency and preferably using existing infrastructure. The Commission plans to adopt the proposal for the new TEN‑T Guidelines in the coming days, as part of a package which also consists of the Energy and Telecommunication Guidelines and the ‘Connecting Europe Facility’ Regulation. Until the proposal has been adopted by the Commission, no information can be provided concerning the concrete location of the core network.
