WRITTEN QUESTION E-2674/04 by Carmen Fraga Estévez (PPE-DE) to the Commission (29 October 2004) Subject: NAFO allocation criteria What is the Commission's view on the proposal of NAFO's Fisheries Committee concerning the allocation of shrimp stocks in NAFO's Division 3L? Does it not believe that the possible increase of 1000 tonnes for Denmark (on behalf of the Faeroe Islands and Greenland), pursuant to NAFO's Scientific Committee's decision on increasing the TAC, would mean favouring precisely those who have traditionally objected to the shrimp allocation in Division 3L (which has led to the establishment of a separate quota)?
