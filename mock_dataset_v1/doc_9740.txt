WRITTEN QUESTION E-0400/06 by Caroline Lucas (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (7 February 2006) Subject: Bulgarian zoos There are currently around 23 zoos in operation in Bulgaria. Bulgaria has not asked for a transposition period for the Zoo Directive (1999/22/EC OJ L 94, 9.4.1999, p. 24 . ) during its accession negotiations with the European Union, and is therefore obliged to implement all necessary measures before becoming a member of the EU. At present, two thirds of the zoos are in bad or very bad condition. Promotion of public awareness and education in relation to the conservation of biodiversity, participation in research and the keeping of animals under conditions which satisfy their biological and conservation requirements is widely lacking. Is the Commission aware that the Bulgarian Government needs to increase its efforts to implement the Zoos Directive before entering the European Union? How will the European Commission guarantee that all zoos in Bulgaria are licensed in time and that measures are implemented in accordance with the directive?
