WRITTEN QUESTION E-5942/08 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (5 November 2008) Subject: Mafia property In Italy, the way in which mafia property is confiscated, under Law 109 of 7 March 1996, is far from transparent. In Sicily, particularly in Palermo, the allocation of accommodation confiscated from criminal and mafia organisations, in the context of the housing emergency affecting over 10 000 registered households, seems to be increasingly based on favouritism. What is of particular concern is not only the Italian Government's clear intention to squander public property, but also the punitive measures being taken against anyone who denounces this. Does the Commission not consider that, under the EU Treaties' provisions on police and judicial cooperation, EU‑wide coordination is required to ensure that national laws on property confiscated from criminal organisations are made more effective?
