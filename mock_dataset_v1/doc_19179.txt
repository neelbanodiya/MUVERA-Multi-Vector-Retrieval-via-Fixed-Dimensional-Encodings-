and far greater transparency in such transactions; 8. Considers that tax policy should be used more actively to address the massive profits made by the oil industry and to promote, through tax incentives, alternative sources of energy with regard to industry as well as citizens generally; 9. Calls on the Commission to present proposals on how to use corporate social responsibility policy at EU level to channel more private investment financed by the current windfall profits in the oil industry into energy-saving programmes and alternative energy technologies and related R&D; believes that this should be pursued either on the basis of a voluntary agreement with oil companies or, alternatively, through an EU-wide coordinated tax initiative; 10. Calls on the Commission to counter the risk of increased social exclusion resulting from higher oil prices; affirms the need to use the European Social Fund in addressing unemployment stemming from the rise in oil prices; calls on the governments to reduce the negative effects of rising oil prices on the most vulnerable social groups; 11. Recalls the importance of the existing legislation on reducing EU energy demand; notes that if the existing and upcoming legislation is fully implemented at least 23% of energy savings could be achieved by 2020; urges the Member States to meet their renewable energy targets, as set in the directive on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources; 12. Notes that the huge potential of renewable energy for heating and cooling has scarcely been exploited, and that geothermal and solar thermal energy, biofuels and biomass can replace large amounts of fossil fuels, particularly oil; calls on the Commission, therefore, to come forward with a directive on renewable energies in heating and cooling; 13. Is concerned about the under-use of environmental technology solutions that are already available; welcomes initiatives to reinforce instruments for financing energy efficiency and investments in material efficiency; calls for public investment support in general to be made conditional on selecting environment-friendly production methods, including greater use of environment-friendly coal-based energy; 14. Calls on the Commission to develop measures in the transport sector as a matter of urgency, not only with a view to guaranteeing security of supply for petroleum products but also on environmental grounds, including use of more fuel-efficient engines and conversion to alternative fuel and propulsion technologies; greater efforts should also be made in the promising area of developing hydrogen and fuel
