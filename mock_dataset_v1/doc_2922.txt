Joint answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-1023/10 , E-1124/10 (11 May 2010) Directive 2007/60/EC (the Floods Directive) Directive 2007/60/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on the assessment and management of flood risks. Text with EEA relevance, OJ L 288, 6.11.2007. requires Member States to use available information such as records and studies on long term developments, in particular regarding climate change impact on the occurence of flood events, when carrying out the preliminary flood risk assessment for the first time in 2011, then in 2019 and every six years thereafter. Depending on the needs of the Member States, the assessment shall include a consideration of the impact of climate change on the occurrence of floods, when assessing potential adverse consequenses of future floods. The directive furthermore requires that, for the second cycle, the likely impact of climate change shall be taken into account in the reviews of the preliminary flood risk assessment and in the review of the flood risk management plans, scheduled for 2021 and every six years thereafter. As regards the environmental impact of flood events, Member States are expected to include information in the River Basin Management Plans required by the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC Directive 2000/60/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy, OJ L 327, 22.12.2000. ) regarding cases in which, due to extreme events such as exceptional floods, an exception based on Article 4(6) of the directive would justify a temporary deterioration of the status of the water bodies concerned. Because of the serious delays in the process of preparing such River Basin Management Plans in Greece, for which the Commission is envisaging legal action, the Commission cannot assess the environmental impacts of the flood events in question. The Floods Directive is at an early stage of implementation. It provides for a holistic approach to flood risk management, including climate change adaptation and coordination of flood risk management in shared river basin in the EU and with non-EU Members. On this basis, the Commission does not think it is necessary to establish another flood prevention mechanism at the European level. Moreover, European forecasting systems are already being developed, notably the European Flood Alert System (EFAS). The need to reduce the risk from floods has been
