Question for written answer E-6870/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (1 September 2010) Subject: Compatibility with EC law of UK cost-saving measures for language interpretation A London constituent has written and complained regarding the UK Ministry of Justice’s decision to abolish the National Agreement on the Engagement of Interpreters in Criminal Proceedings, the National Register of Public Service Interpreters, NRPSI and the NRCPD, the register of suitably qualified sign language interpreters. These measures having been presumably taken by the new UK coalition government for reasons of improved efficiency and costs savings at a time of necessary austerity measures and cuts in UK public expenditure. However, my constituent has cited a possible breach of the EU directive on the minimum standards on interpretation and translation required in all EU Member States for foreign nationals subject to criminal justice proceedings, which I believe the UK may have already transposed into UK domestic law, and she has also cited a possible breach of Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, enacted by the UK Human Rights Act 1998. Can the Commission confirm that the new UK government‘s decision to enact these cost savings measures is taken exclusively as a matter that falls within its competence and that the UK Ministry of Justice‘s alternative and more cost-efficient measures now proposed fully address the requirements of EC law to provide adequate interpretation facilities for foreign nationals affected by criminal proceedings?
