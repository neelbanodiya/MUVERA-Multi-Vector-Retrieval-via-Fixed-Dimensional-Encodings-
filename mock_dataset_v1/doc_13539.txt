that the allegations of secret jails in Europe came from a confused source and from a leak in the media, Sophia in 't Veld (ALDE, NL) replied that many major scandals in history were uncovered by the press, like the horrors at the Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq. Closing the debate, the chair of the Civil Liberties Committee Jean-Marie Cavada (ALDE, FR) also spoke in favour of investigating the issue but urged MEPs to be very prudent in choosing the legal basis and the form of the investigation: "I am not really sure if we can stick out a foot and demand a committee of inquiry. I am not sure if there is sufficient legal basis for this. However, we can definitely claim our sovereignty to start up some kind of investigation and draw some conclusions" . The Civil Liberties Committee will hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss this issue on 12 December in Strasbourg. Commissioner Frattini and a Council of Europe representative will be invited to address the meeting. Parliament's political groups will also request that the Council of Ministers and the Commission make statements during the Strasbourg plenary. 2005-12-01 Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs Chair Jean-Marie Cavada ALDE FR 20051130IPR03072 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
