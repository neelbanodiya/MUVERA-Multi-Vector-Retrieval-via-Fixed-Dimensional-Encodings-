adequate, sustainable and safe European pension systems’; recognises that a wide debate on the future of pension systems in Europe is of vital importance and should take into account the current economic and demographic situation, completion of the single market and reform of economic governance, as well as the recently established European supervisory architecture; 2. Notes that both the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact refer to age-related public expenditure; believes that the accurate inclusion of public direct pension liabilities in public debt and deficit calculations is one of many conditions for sustainability; requests that the reform of economic governance take this dimension into account by ensuring adequate treatment of the various pension-system pillars and focusing on their sustainability; 3.

Emphasises that pensions and pension systems are, without doubt, matters that come within the exclusive competence, responsibility and decision-making power of the Member States; calls on the Commission to ensure clearly that it strictly respects the subsidiarity principle in this policy area; 8. Considers that it is impossible and counterproductive to set a harmonised retirement age at European level since this age depends largely on the specific conditions prevailing in each Member State; stresses instead that effective measures must be taken to combat the sharp rise in unemployment in many Member States; 9.
