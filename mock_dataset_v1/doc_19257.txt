2004/C 70 E/194 WRITTEN QUESTION P-2989/03 by Ioannis Marínos (PPE-DE) to the Commission (6 October 2003) Subject: Commission funding for the European Policy Centre In an invitation to MEPs, the European Policy Centre (EPC), which is situated in Brussels, indicates that His Excellency the President of Northern Cyprus, Rauf Denktas (sic) will be a guest at a breakfast policy briefing and urges the Members to attend. However, it is common knowledge that no country in the world (apart from Turkey, which is responsible for the military occupation of 37 % of Cyprus) acknowledges Mr Denktas as President , or accords his pseudo-state any degree of official recognition, while the UN and EU have repeatedly criticised his secessionist ambitions. Furthermore, this event, coinciding as it does with the run-up to the Presidential elections , could accordingly be interpreted as support for Mr Denktas against his political opponents. Can the Commission tell me whether the Centre receives Community funding? If so, in which year did it commence and what precise amounts have been paid? If the Centre is receiving European Union funding, what steps will the Commission take to impress upon the recipients the inadmissibility of using the funds to promote recognition of regimes based on the use of violence and disregard for law?
