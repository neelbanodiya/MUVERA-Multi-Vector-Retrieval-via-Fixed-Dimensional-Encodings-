Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (22 August 2007) The situation described by the Honourable Member does not seem to fall under the competence of the Commission. The Commission recalls that it may deal with individual cases of possible violations of fundamental rights only if an issue of European Community law is involved, which does not appear to be the case in the matter to which the Honourable Member refers.
