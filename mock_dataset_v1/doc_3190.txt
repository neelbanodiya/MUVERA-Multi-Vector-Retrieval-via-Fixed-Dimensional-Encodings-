Question for written answer P-7778/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Miguel Portas (GUE/NGL) (24 September 2010) Subject: Agreement between Italy and Libya and control of maritime borders On the evening of Sunday, 12 September, gunshots were fired in international waters between Italy and Libya at Italian fishermen sailing in the waters of the Gulf of Sirte. The fishermen were shot by a patrol boat flying the Libyan flag that had previously been donated to the government in Tripoli by the Italian Government under a bilateral agreement. The patrol boat in question had been carrying both Libyan and Italian officials and its role was supposed to be one of border control in respect of illegal immigration, with the assistance of Italian colleagues and without using firearms. Following the incident, the Italian interior minister, said: ‘I imagine they took the fishing boat — as occasionally happens — for a boat which, having failed to stop when ordered to do so, might have been carrying illegal immigrants.’ Is the Commission aware of the content of the bilateral agreement between Italy and Libya, which includes provisions on the control of the EU's southern borders? If not, will it ask the Italian Government for a copy? Does the Commission not agree that the fact that Italian officers were on board the Libyan patrol boats in question, and that firearms were present and used, means that a Member State — Italy — is directly responsible for such criticisable management of border control? Will the Commission ask the Italian Government for explanations? Does the Commission not agree that the words of the Italian Minister of the Interior (‘I imagine they took the fishing boat … for a boat which … might have been carrying illegal immigrants’) suggest implicit authorisation to use firearms against migrants crossing the Mediterranean? Does it not also agree that the use of weapons by patrols along maritime borders should be prohibited?
