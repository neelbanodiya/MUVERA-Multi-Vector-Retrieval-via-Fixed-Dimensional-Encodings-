ORAL QUESTION H-0832/02 for Question Time at the part-session in January 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Bart Staes to the Commission Subject: CFSP: Future prospects for Kosova Recent contacts with political leaders in Kosova have made it clear to me that the young Kosovan institutions face enormous handicaps in seeking to pursue a real and effective policy, not least on the socio-economic front. I can dispense with a description of the dire economic situation in Kosova, well known as it is. Kosova needs urgently to be enabled to pursue an imaginative policy in order to attract investment. The big problem is that the Kosovan authorities are prevented by the statute in force from pursuing any such policy. Kosova is, in particular, not at present in a position to conclude any international trade agreements or to contract loans with international financial institutions. Kosova needs a clearly autonomous statute. I therefore ask the Commission what future prospects it can hold out to the Kosovars of that happening. Specifically, can Kosovan institutions count on very wide-ranging autonomy in the future?
