ORAL QUESTION H-0110/02 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Olivier Dupuis to the Council Subject: Taiwan In its answer of 10 December 2001 to Question P-1559/01 on Taiwan's observer status at the WHO, the Council said that it had not been willing to 'support Taiwan's application for observer status at the WHO', adding: 'While the Council would welcome a greater exchange of information between the WHO and Taiwan, it would not support the granting of a status to Taiwan in this or any other UN organisation which was inconsistent with its commitment to the principle of "One China" or the rules and regulations governing observer status in that organisation'. The Council and the Member States lent their unanimous support to the Taipei authorities in the process which led to Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a body which is an integral part of the UN system. On the basis of this precedent, namely Taiwan's joining the WTO, that is, an organisation forming part of the UN system, does the Council not consider that the conditions now exist for it to declare itself publicly in favour of Taiwan being granted observer status in all the organisations and specialised agencies of the UN system, thus creating the minimum conditions for cooperation at international level - conditions which would necessarily work to the benefit of Taiwan and of the entire international community?
