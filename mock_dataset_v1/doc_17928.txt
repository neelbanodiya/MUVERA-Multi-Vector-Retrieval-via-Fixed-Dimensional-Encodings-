ORAL QUESTION H-0064/10 for Question Time at the part-session in March 2010 pursuant to Rule 116 of the Rules of Procedure by Alan Kelly to the Commission Subject: Citizens' Initiative - making it accessible online The Lisbon Treaty has given legal status to a new model of participatory democracy known as the 'Citizens' Initiative'. Would the Commission be willing to explore the possibility of making the Citizens' Initiative available in an online medium for efficient and accessible signature collecting? The internet is now Europeans' principal method of mass communication and is a particularly effective tool for participatory democracy. We have all seen the MySpace and Facebook campaigns for political initiatives and how much citizens have got involved in trying to enforce democratic change. Given the advancement of information and communications technology, it should be possible to verify signatures online and, if the Commission incorporated an online element to the Citizens' Initiative, it would open the way for true, participatory democracy that would make the ability to gather signatures much easier and cheaper, and make debate in a European public sphere more possible. Would the Commission indicate whether it believes this to be a possibility, while also taking into account the rights of those who do not use the internet to take part in the Citizens' Initiative via traditional signatures.
