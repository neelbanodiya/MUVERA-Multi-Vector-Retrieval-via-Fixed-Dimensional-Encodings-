Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (17 April 2008) In reply to the Honourable Member's written question, the Commission notes that according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, Member States have ‘a sufficient degree of latitude to determine what is required to protect the players and, more generally, in the light of the specific social and cultural features of each Member State, to maintain order in society, as regards the manner in which lotteries are operated, the size of the stakes, and the allocation of the profits they yield. In those circumstances, it is for them to assess not only whether it is necessary to restrict the activities of lotteries but also whether they should be prohibited, provided that those restrictions are not discriminatory’. The Court also confirmed in other judgments of 21 September 1999 in Case C‑124/97, Läära, paragraph 35; of 21 October 1999 in Case C‑67/98, Zenatti, paragraph 33; and of 11 September 2003 in Case C‑6/01, Anomar, paragraph 79. that it is a view shared by all that it should be a matter for the national authorities to consider whether, in the context of the aim pursued, it is necessary to prohibit gambling activities, totally or partially. It follows that the prohibition of casinos in Cyprus does not contravene the EU internal market rules. The cases the Commission has opened against a number of countries on gambling-related questions concerned discrimination of foreign operators and the unequal treatment of operators through inconsistency and the imposition of disproportionate requirements in national policies. Consequently, the Commission is not considering taking legal action against Cyprus on this issue.
