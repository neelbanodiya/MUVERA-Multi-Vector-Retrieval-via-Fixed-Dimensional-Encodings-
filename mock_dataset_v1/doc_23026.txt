Question for written answer E-001232/2011 to the Council Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (14 February 2011) Subject: Unpunished rape in India The International Secretariat of the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) has been informed by a member organisation of the SOS Torture Network about the rape of a 16 year-old Dalit girl. The crime was committed with complete impunity and the victim has since been threatened. According to the information received, the rape took place on 31 August 2010 in the village of Simulpur in West Bengal. When the victim reported the rape at Gaighata police station, the officer in charge forced her to rewrite the complaint several times in order to exclude one of the perpetrators, with whom he allegedly had connections. Despite pressure from the victim's family and neighbours, the rapists remained at liberty and no investigation was made into their actions. This led to 104 residents of Simulpur presenting a written petition to the Parganas North District Superintendent of Police, asking for appropriate legal action to be taken against the two rapists. However, contrary to expectations, the victim was notified in the first week of January 2011 that a criminal case had been initiated against her, accusing her of having stolen 30 000 rupees from the accused, conspired against them, and falsely implicated them in a criminal case. In view of the element of discrimination, due to the victim's caste origin, and the seriousness of the crime: Has the Council shown any interest in this case? What steps does the Council intend to take vis-à-vis the Indian Government to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice? Does the Council intend to protect the victim of this crime in any way?
