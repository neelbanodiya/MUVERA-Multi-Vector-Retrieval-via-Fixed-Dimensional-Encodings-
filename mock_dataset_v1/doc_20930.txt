WRITTEN QUESTION P-5809/08 by Luisa Morgantini (GUE/NGL) to the Council (22 October 2008) Subject: Departure of Palestinian students from the Gaza Strip to European universities According to Amnesty International, there are dozens of Palestinian students in the Gaza Strip who want to leave the Strip to study at universities abroad. These students fulfil all the requirements to study abroad: they have qualifications to show their host universities and are in possession of visas for the host countries. Nevertheless, the Israeli authorities are preventing them from leaving the Gaza Strip. The refusal of the Israeli authorities to let these students leave violates their right to freedom of movement, as set out in Article 13.2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and their right to education, as set out in Article 13.1 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Has the European Council undertaken any action in support of Palestinian students who have scholarships to European universities and/or Palestinian students admitted to European universities and in possession of visas for the host countries that will allow them to leave the Gaza Strip and study in Europe? What kind of action will the European Council undertake in order to put pressure on the Israeli authorities to let the Palestinian students leave the Gaza Strip and guarantee their right to freedom of movement and education?
