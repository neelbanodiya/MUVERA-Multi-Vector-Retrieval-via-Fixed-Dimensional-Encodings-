Reply (2 August 2006) The presidential elections in Azerbaijan in 2003, and the recent partial repeat of parliamentary elections in 2006, were monitored by OSCE/ODIHR. The EU endorsed the latter's preliminary report, which pointed to serious flaws, especially in the compilation of the results, but welcomed the fact that the repeat elections (held after strong insistence by the international community) showed some improvements. The final report is due shortly. Unlike the Belarusian authorities, the Azeri authorities have engaged with the EU and the OSCE. There have been no democratic elections in Turkmenistan under President Niyazov. Relations with the EU are at a low level. The Council continues seeking to engage the Turkmen authorities, notably on the occasion of a yearly human rights dialogue. Although the EU has little leverage over this country, the Council believes that a policy of total boycotting from the EU side would not bring about any improvements in the fields of human rights, democratisation and the rule of law, but would worsen the situation instead. Therefore the Council continues to try to engage with the Turkmen authorities, notably through its EUSR for Central Asia, Mr Kubiš. As regards Uzbekistan, the EU agreed to punitive measures on 3 October 2005, including extensive visa bans on the authorities responsible for the events in Andijan, as compared to the measures against the Belarus authorities. The Council reconfirmed the aforementioned measures on 15 May 2006. The Council will review these measures before October 2006, taking into account the evolution of events.
