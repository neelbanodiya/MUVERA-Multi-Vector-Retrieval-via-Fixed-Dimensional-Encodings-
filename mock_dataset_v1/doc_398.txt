WRITTEN QUESTION E-4687/08 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 September 2008) Subject: ‘Green health’ policy 1. Has the European Union taken any initiatives to promote ‘green health’ measures? 2. What measures are being taken in relation to the use of polyvinyl chloride (also known as ‘vinyl’), which verifiably pollutes the environment with dioxins and, at the same time, exposes hospital patients and staff to the risk of severe contamination? 3. Are there any viable and effective solutions to replace current medical waste management practices, such as incineration, which is a source of toxic emissions (dioxins, mercury and lead) into the environment?
