WRITTEN QUESTION E-4998/05 by Werner Langen (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (10 January 2006) Subject: Premium entitlements in the farming industry/agricultural border regions The guidelines laid down in the European Union's common agricultural policy continue to leave decisions on the award of premiums to the discretion of individual regions and/or Member States. As a result, agricultural holdings in border regions are placed at a financial disadvantage. A typical example is provided by a holding whose grassland area is split equally between Germany and Belgium. Since the Federal Republic of Germany pays a premium for grassland areas, but Belgium does not, the holding in question is financially worse off than a holding whose grassland area is situated solely in one country. 1. Is the European Commission aware of similar cases? 2. What steps does the European Commission plan to take in order to find a fair, uniform solution to the problem of premium entitlements for agricultural holdings with grassland areas in border regions?
