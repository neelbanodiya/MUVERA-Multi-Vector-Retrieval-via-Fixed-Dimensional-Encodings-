WRITTEN QUESTION E-2614/10 by Alan Kelly (S&D) to the Commission (20 April 2010) Subject: New civil aviation legislation, Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 of 4 March 2010 Can the Commission indicate what it defines as ammunition in the List of Prohibited Items outlined in Attachment 5-B of Commission Regulation (EU) No 185/2010 OJ L 55, 5.3.2010, p. 1 . ? Does this definition apply only to assembled ammunition, or to all forms of ammunition? Does Attachment 5-B prohibit the transportation of ammunition in hold baggage even if in transit it is stored away from firearms, in a separate lockable box, and if each round is packaged separately from each other? Provision 5.4.2 specifies that prohibited items may be transported in certain circumstances; can the Commission indicate if there are Member States which, for reasons such as sport tourism, have national rules allowing for the safe carriage of ammunition? If so, how many Member States? Is Ireland one of them?
