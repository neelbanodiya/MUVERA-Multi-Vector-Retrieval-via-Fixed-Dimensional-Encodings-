WRITTEN QUESTION E-0208/07 by Nikolaos Vakalis (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (31 January 2007) Subject: Electronic surveillance of workers It emerged from the consultations held by the Commission in October 2002 that most Member States did not have any special legislation in force to protect the personal data of workers; in fact, according to report (COM(2003)265), many Member States had not at that stage even implemented Directive 95/46/EC OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31. concerning data protection generally. In view of the above, will the Commission say: 1. Do clear-cut and uniform legislative arrangements exist at present in Europe regarding the electronic surveillance of workers by employers (in particular the registration of telephone calls, surveillance of electronic messages and access to websites visited by the worker)? 2. If no such uniform legislative arrangements exist, what individual arrangements exist in Member States on the electronic surveillance of workers? If it is permitted in certain Member States, under which conditions and on which terms does this occur? 3. What data are available in particular about arrangements in Greece as far as the electronic surveillance of workers is concerned? 4. Does any provision exist for a future review of Directive 95/46/EC, particularly as regards the electronic surveillance of workers?
