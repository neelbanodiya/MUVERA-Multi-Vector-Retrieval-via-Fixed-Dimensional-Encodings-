WRITTEN QUESTION E-3413/06 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (25 July 2006) Subject: Diagnostic medical centres in Greece Recently enacted Greek legislation provides for a limited number of medical radiological laboratories to be set up on the basis of demographic criteria; it justifies this measure on the grounds that this is provided for in the Euratom Treaty provisions, as a measure to protect public health. It also establishes the principle of ‘authorisation where expedient’ to establish a medical radiological laboratory. Could this arrangement providing for a specific number of medical radiological laboratories in relation to the population be considered to be in keeping with Community legislation? Could it be justified by Article 8 of Directive 97/43/Euratom? Are there restrictions on the number of medical radiological laboratories under Directives 97/43/Euratom or 96/29/Euratom or other relevant directives? Does EU legislation provide for ‘authorisation where expedient’ for opening radiological laboratories in any EU Member State?
