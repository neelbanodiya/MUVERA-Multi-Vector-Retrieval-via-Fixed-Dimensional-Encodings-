Question for written answer E-006312/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Diogo Feio (PPE) (28 June 2011) Subject: Sunblocks The US government has announced its intention to impose severe restrictions on the advertising of sunblock products, on the grounds that many of their manufacturers' claims are misleading and unscientific. Under the new rules, only creams with a protection factor higher than 15, i.e. those offering genuine protection against the effects of UVA and UVB rays, will be certified as offering consumers dermatological protection. 1. Is the Commission aware of these measures in the US? 2. Is the Commission considering similar measures for the EU? Will it consider introducing a mandatory protection threshold (in excess of 15) — with a view to ensuring that sunblocks offer guaranteed anti-UVA and UVB dermatological protection?
