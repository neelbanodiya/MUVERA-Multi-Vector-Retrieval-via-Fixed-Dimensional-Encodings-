that Member States should define adequacy as the condition required for older people to live a decent life; 16. Considers that Member States are themselves responsible for making adequate pension provisions for their citizens as part of their social and economic policies; encourages them to put in place a system which is the most appropriate for guaranteeing a decent standard of living for everybody, with particular attention to the most vulnerable groups in society; 17. Stresses that, within the range of pension systems, diversification of pension income from a mix of public (first pillar) and work-related (in most cases second pillar) schemes, can provide a guarantee of adequate pension provision; 18. Notes that in most Member States the first pillar is the most important one and based on the solidarity principle and that the financing of the first pillar will be less under pressure if more people are at work and if illegal and undeclared work is addressed, while other alternative forms of financing the first pillar could also be discussed between the Member States in the Open Method of Coordination; stresses that statutory pay-as-you-go schemes have proved their stability and reliability in the test presented by the financial and economic crisis; calls on Member States to ensure that first-pillar pensions are above the poverty line; 19. Stresses that, regarding the sustainability and adequacy of pension systems, in some Member States third pillar savings provisions play a role; stresses, however, that this option is available only to persons who have an adequate income which would enable them to contribute to such systems and therefore can only play a limited role in providing a decent income; 20. Believes that better sharing of information between Member States on the costs and effectiveness of forms of tax relief on private pensions would be very useful; 21. Considers that, given budgetary pressure, efficiency in social spending is of major importance; considers that, in view of the current budgetary pressure, social spending has played a significant economic and social role in softening the effects of the crisis; considers that pay-as-you-go schemes have demonstrated their fundamental role in creating solidarity between generations; also considers that the second and third pillars have a supplementary role to play in reducing pressure; calls on Member States to ensure the best possible mix of forms of pension provision to safeguard pensions in the future; calls upon Member States to improve
