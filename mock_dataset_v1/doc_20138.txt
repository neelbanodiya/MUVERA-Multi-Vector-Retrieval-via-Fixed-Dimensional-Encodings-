Question for written answer E-3809/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Ioannis A. Tsoukalas (PPE) and Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) (1 June 2010) Subject: EU imports of fish and aquaculture products Given that: — the EU is the largest market for fish and aquaculture products, with imports to a value of EUR 17.1 billion, ahead of the USA (EUR 11.2 billion), Japan (EUR 11.1 billion) and China (EUR 3.3 billion), demand for these commodities being expected to rise in the coming years, making it necessary to cover consumer demand in Europe by means of imports; — imports from third countries for purchase by European consumers are frequently exceptionally low-priced and of doubtful quality, having been produced by a workforce employed under inadmissible working conditions, thereby intensifying the problem of unfair competition and distortion of the internal market; — in the context of the Dohr Round, the further deregulation of international trade in non-agricultural products (NAMA), including fish and aquaculture products, through the reduction or, where possible, the total removal of protective tariff barriers is being discussed; — it is widely considered that fish and aquaculture products should, given their special nature, be considered as ‘sensitive products’ and accordingly, subject to specific trade regulations and not treated in the same way as any other industrial product; 1. Has the Commission assessed the consequences for this sector of the possible full deregulation of international trade in fish and aquaculture products? Would the total removal of tariff barriers or application of the ‘Swiss formula’ not run counter to efforts to strengthen the European fisheries and aqualture sector? What form of protection is the EU willing to offer European fisheries and fish farms? 2. How will it guarantee European consumers high-quality affordable fisheries products, while at the same time combating social dumping? 3. Should the DG for Trade and the DG for Maritime Policy and Fisheries not cooperate more effectively and to their mutual benefit so as to ensure that any decisions by one do not undermine measures taken by the other?
