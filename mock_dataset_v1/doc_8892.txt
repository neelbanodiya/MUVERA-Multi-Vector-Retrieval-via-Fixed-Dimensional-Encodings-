Question for written answer E-003024/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Evelyn Regner (S&D) (29 March 2011) Subject: Unofficial traineeships at the European Commission The Commission offers official traineeships for university graduates in order to introduce young people to the working methods and various policies of the EU. These traineeships are awarded following a long selection process, last for five months in principle and take place in Brussels or Strasbourg. The following conditions apply to the remuneration of trainees: — a monthly ‘grant’ equivalent to 25 % of the basic salary of an official in salary grade AD5/1 (Commission Decision C/2007/1221); — reimbursement of travel costs for arrival and departure (subject to conditions); — automatic, mandatory insurance against accidents (a tenth of the cost is deducted from the monthly grant; the rest is paid by the Commission) and mandatory health insurance (trainees who do not have their own health insurance are insured through a contract concluded by the Commission, the cost of which is also deducted from the grant). Does the Commission also award ‘unofficial’ traineeships, in delegations in third countries for example, under different conditions than for official traineeships? Do the trainees receive remuneration or allowances for the duration of the traineeship? If so, what are the differences in the traineeships’ contents and/or contracts which justify that official trainees should be remunerated and ‘unofficial’ trainees not?
