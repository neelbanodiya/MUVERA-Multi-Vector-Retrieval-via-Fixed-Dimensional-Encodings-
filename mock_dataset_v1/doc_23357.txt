WRITTEN QUESTION E-4416/07 by Luís Queiró (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (18 September 2007) Subject: Community funding vis-à-vis the destruction of a hectare of maize in Herdade da Lameira Whereas on 17 August 2007, a group of activists invaded and partially destroyed a legal plantation of genetically modified maize in Herdade da Lameira, in the Algarve (Portugal); whereas various news reports claim that those responsible were taking part in the Ecotopia meeting organised ‘by GAIA and the European Youth for Action (EYFA)’, (see those organisations' website www.gaia.org.pt), which enjoyed, inter alia , support from the ‘European Union's Youth in Action Programme’, as is also stated on the website (and see also www.ecotopiagathering.org); whereas, despite the claims of the organisers of this event (as stated on the website), it is not clear that the organisation has nothing at all to do with these acts of vandalism and attacks on private property (which constitute illegal and criminal behaviour); whereas, as stated above, the organisations involved in these events have received Community funding; whereas the European Union should not be funding initiatives which are in any way linked to criminal acts, and whereas the funding of NGOs should therefore be clear and transparent, and should not help to promote, encourage or sponsor illegal acts, does the Commission intend to verify whether, in any way, EU money enabled these criminal acts to take place, or facilitated them, and is it prepared to review the funding already assigned or to be assigned to any of these organisations or initiatives? Has the Commission been informed by the Portuguese Government of any of the facts set out above, with a view to elucidating whether, in any way, Community funding was used to finance the illegal destruction of part of a genetically-modified maize plantation in Herdade da Lameira in Portugal?
