WRITTEN QUESTION E-1776/10 by Clemente Mastella (PPE) to the Commission (22 March 2010) Subject: Urgent measures to support the tobacco sector in Europe The 2004 CAP reform of the tobacco sector provides for the gradual phasing out of production subsidies and their replacement by fully decoupled payments. The negative effects of this reform are already apparent in many Member States, such as Italy, where tobacco is often the only source of income for many thousands of family units and where a sharp drop in production has been recorded. Tobacco growing in the EU has no effect on tobacco consumption levels, but it is extremely important from a social and economic point of view. The sector provides work for approximately 100 000 tobacco growers and 400 000 hired workers in the EU, to say nothing of related industries. The planned total decoupling of production subsidies will result in the complete eradication of tobacco growing across the European Union, meaning tobacco will need to be imported from non-EU countries. 1. In the light of the above, would the Commission agree that the current CAP review offers an ideal opportunity to introduce some amendments to the provisions adopted during the 2004 reform? 2. Does the Commission not feel that it would be right and proper to maintain production support measures until 2013 at least, to prevent a complete collapse of the tobacco market? 3. Finally, in view of the market’s acknowledged ‘state of crisis’, does it not think that extraordinary national measures, such as extending contribution, tax and banking deadlines, zero-rating excise duty on agricultural fuel and reducing social security charges for firms in particularly disadvantaged areas, could be authorised to protect production and employment?
