for a Council decision on the signing of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China on the readmission of persons residing without authorisation (SEC(2002) 412 – C5-0263/2002 – 2002/0092(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0381/2002 Procedure : Consultation procedure Debate : 18.12.2002 Vote: 19.12.2002 Vote Although unhappy with some aspects of the agreement negotiated between the European Commission and the Chinese Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong on the return of illegal immigrants, Parliament has delivered its non-binding approval of the agreement. Parliament deplored the fact that it has not been regularly informed on the progress in the negotiations, all the more so since this is the first readmission agreement by the Community with a third country and further agreements will be modelled on this one. As to the contents of the agreement, Parliament considers that the human rights clause is too weak, as it does not refer explicitly to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the 1951 Geneva Convention. Nevertheless, it was prepared to approve the agreement as there is only a small number of illegal immigrants from Hong Kong in the EU and visa requirements for Hong Kong citizens have been abolished.
