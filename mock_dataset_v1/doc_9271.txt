Answer given by Ms Wallström on behalf of the Commission (24 April 2008) The Treaty of Lisbon incorporates into the current Treaties the important achievements that came out of the work of the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC). However, taking into account the new political context and the requests of several Member States, including the United Kingdom, the 2007 IGC adopted a draft Treaty which is different from the 2004 text and answers the different concerns expressed during the negotiations. Moreover, unlike the Constitution, the Treaty of Lisbon does not repeal or replace the texts of the current Treaties, which thus remain in force (the EC treaty being renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). Following the mandate given by the Heads of State or Government in June 2007, the Intergovernmental Conference returned to the traditional technique that was used for the previous revisions to the Treaties (Single European Act, Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice).
