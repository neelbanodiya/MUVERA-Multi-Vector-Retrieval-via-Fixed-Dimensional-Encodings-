Due to extension of call for proposals and the set reference amounts remaining available for subsidies in the 2006 budget, the decision on subsidies in the budget procedure should be easier than in the previous years. The Commission has left no margin to be allocated in the 2006 budget procedure. 11. The Rapporteur proposes to follow the procedure used in previous budget procedures whereby the vote on amendments on subsidies will be done in a block vote to ensure better coherence. The Rapporteur intends to use the information on the 2005 implementation as basis for his recommendations. 12. In view of the new legal bases proposed for the period after 2006, it would be important to assess the functioning of the current system. Key questions relate to the flexibility and margin available for the budgetary authority to allocate the funds, eligibility for funding (earmarking, calls for proposals) and relation between legal bases and the Financial Regulation (e.g. degressivity).
