WRITTEN QUESTION E-4596/06 by Richard Seeber (PPE‑DE) to the Council (26 October 2006) Subject: Measures to protect Romanian orphan children after Romania's accession The dreadful conditions in which Romanian orphan children in state orphanages live have been known internationally at the latest since Ceauşescu was deposed in 1989. According to Caritas, 52787 children were still living in state children’s homes in 2001. Even today, over 15 years after the Romanian Revolution, the conditions in which the children in these homes live are, according to the International Society for Human Rights (ISHR), at times appalling. Although Amnesty International’s 2006 annual report drew Romania’s attention to the Commission’s findings on the measures introduced to reinforce children’s rights, the continued worrying situation of orphan children in Romania should not be lost sight of after Romania’s planned accession in 2007. 1. The Commission should encourage and monitor child protection reforms during the whole accession process. What specific action to protect Romanian orphan children is to be taken for the period after the planned accession of Romania in 2007? 2. How will the objectives laid down in Commission Communication COM(2006)0367 be implemented in this specific case after accession, and how will Romania be supported after 2007 in its efforts to improve the situation of children? 3. How will it be possible to ensure the protection of children in children’s homes in the event that Romania fails to make sufficient efforts to reinforce children’s rights?
