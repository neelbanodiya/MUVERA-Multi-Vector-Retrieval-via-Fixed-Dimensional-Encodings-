WRITTEN QUESTION E-6526/09 by Georgios Papastamkos (PPE) to the Commission (7 January 2010) Subject: Preventing future food supply crises In the light of the food supply crisis in 2007-08, does the Commission consider the World Trade Organisation rules and the EU's negotiating strategy on the relaunching of the Doha Round negotiations with the aim of preventing future food supply crises to be appropriate? Food price volatility on both the world and the European market is creating insecurity among commodity producers and uncertainty among participants in the corresponding markets. Given that the World Trade Organisation's regulatory framework and the negotiating positions upheld to date by contributing parties in relation to the ‘farm package’ make no provision for the essential parameter of ‘food security’ and other ‘non-trade aspects’, will the Commission place this parameter on the table at the multilateral trade talks? Does the Commission share the view that the further opening-up of the European market in agricultural goods through a reduction in import duties will lead to the erosion of the preferences enjoyed by LDCs and other developing countries, benefiting large rival exporting countries at the expense of European producers?
