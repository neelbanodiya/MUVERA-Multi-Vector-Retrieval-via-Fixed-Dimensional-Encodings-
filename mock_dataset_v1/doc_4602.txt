important to underline that the Netherlands is a contracting party of the African-Eurasian Migratory Water bird Agreement (AEWA), and that the European Community is itself also envisaging the approval of this agreement. Parties are obliged to take measures to conserve migratory water birds. Migratory bird species that are covered by the AEWA outside EU territory and waters are protected by the ‘Birds’ Directive Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds, OJ L 103, 25.4.1979 as amended by Commission Directive 91/244/EEC of 6 March 1991, OJ L 115 , 8.5.1991. in the EU. It is also important to note that the Commission supported several projects for the conservation of the marine biodiversity in Mauritania and other third countries, for example the one relating to the yearly international census of water birds. These projects may include the regulation of fishing activities by European firms, among others.
