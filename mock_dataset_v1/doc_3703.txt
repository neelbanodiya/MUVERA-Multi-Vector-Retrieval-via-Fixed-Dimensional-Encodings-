and other means, seem to have caused significant financial damage to consumers. As regards the billing issues raised by the Honourable Member in his third question, according to Article 34 of the Universal Service Directive, consumers have to have the possibility to use transparent, simple, and inexpensive out-of-court dispute resolution mechanisms to resolve such matters. The Greek regulatory authority EETT has put in place an extrajudicial procedure for the resolution of controversies between end-users and telecommunications operators. In line with the national complaints procedures, defrauded consumers therefore should first contact their mobile telecommunications provider to address the issue in dispute. If they do not receive a satisfactory response within a reasonable time, consumers should then contact EETT, who is responsible for enforcing users' rights. Without prejudice to the contractual agreement between the defrauded consumers and the mobile operator as outlined in Article 20 of the Universal Service Directive, in particular on the conditions for the termination of services, consumers, who so request, can retain their number(s) independently of the undertaking providing the service as stipulated by Article 30 of the Universal Service Directive.
