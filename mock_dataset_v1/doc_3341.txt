Answer given by Mr McCreevy on behalf of the Commission (30 August 2005) The acquisition of real estate by a non-resident is a capital movement and the construction of a house on that property could be considered as exercise of rights pertaining to such an operation. Article 56 of the EC Treaty prohibits all restrictions on capital movements, whereas Article 58 of the EC Treaty provides for specific exceptions to the freedom of capital movements. The case law of the European Court of Justice has determined that restrictions to the fundamental Treaty freedoms can be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest. Legitimate general interest considerations recognised by the Court include town and country planning. In its judgment of 15 May 2003 in Case C‑300/01 — Salzmann ECJ ruling of 15.5.2003 in Case C-300/01 Salzmann . , the Court notes, with reference to its earlier decisions in the cases of Konle ECJ ruling of 1.6.1999 in Case C-302/97 Konle . , §40 and Reisch ECJ ruling of 5.3.2002 in Joined Cases C-515/99, C-519/99 to C-524/99 and C-526/99 to C‑540/99 Reisch and Others . , §34, that ‘it is settled case-law that restrictions on the establishment of secondary residences in a specific geographical area, which a Member State imposes in order to maintain, for town and country planning purposes, a permanent population and an economic activity independent of the tourist sector, may be regarded as contributing to an objective in the public interest’ (§ 44). The Commission does not have the precise details of the individual case raised by the Honourable Member (e.g. justification advanced for construction and intended use of the property, local planning authority involved, published rules of that authority, land use plan for the area, other reasons why the particular locality might be subject to a different regime than the rest of the county, the stage at which permission was refused, appeals mechanism, etc.) in order to provide a full reply. However, it would like to point out that it is often the case that the right to build a house is constrained, both for resident or non-resident nationals, as well as for citizens or residents of other Member States.
