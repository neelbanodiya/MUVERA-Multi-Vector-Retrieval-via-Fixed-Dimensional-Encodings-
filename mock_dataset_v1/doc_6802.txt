social services, including child protection, have aimed at reinforcing the responsibility of the public authorities and the structures of the local authorities. Partnerships with NGOs have been encouraged, as NGOs can be service providers under the existing legislation. There has been a lot of progress over the last years, especially in child protection and there are sufficient child protection services available locally, run by local authorities or local NGOs. As mentioned above, organising social services is the responsibility of the Romanian authorities. If the foreign NGOs were to withdraw their support from Romania, a proper transfer of responsibility to the local authorities should normally take place. A temporary local impact may be inevitable in some cases if the local authorities do not have adequate resources for taking over a particular service. Foreign NGOs could also reinforce local structures by transfer of knowledge to local partners. The Commission support will continue as the implementation of capacity building measures through Phare financing will continue until 2009.
