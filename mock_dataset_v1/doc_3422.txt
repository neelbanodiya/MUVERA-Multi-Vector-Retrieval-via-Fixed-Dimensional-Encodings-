Question for written answer E-011439/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (5 December 2011) Subject: Measures to address the housing emergency and the record number of evictions By the end of this year, the number of expulsions in the Puglia region will be up by 10 to 15 % on the figures for 2010 (there have already been 3700 evictions since 1 January 2011) — an alarming situation to which the Puglia branch of the Cisl trade union confederation drew public attention a few days ago. This housing emergency may be put down to the growing financial difficulties experienced by households. 2011 has been a difficult year for tenants because, with various sections of society already in an extremely precarious financial situation, the national rent support fund has now also been shut down without a social housing scheme ever having been implemented for southern Italy. 1. Does the Commission intend to come forward with a proposal that will solve or at least alleviate the problems arising in connection with the housing emergency in Puglia and other disadvantaged areas within the EU? 2. How do house building policies improve the lives of the poorest members of EU society?
