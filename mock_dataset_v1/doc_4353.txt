WRITTEN QUESTION P-0474/06 by Paolo Cirino Pomicino (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (7 February 2006) Subject: Recognition of external credit assessment institutions (ECAI) On 28 September 2005 the European Parliament approved the text of the Credit Requirement Directive, Annex VI, Part II, of which defines the role of and recognition procedure for ECAIs (external credit assessment institutions). In support of the work of the European Parliament and the Commission, the CEBS (Committee of European Banking Supervisors) has been instructed to define in more detail the criteria that individual national authorities will have to adopt in the process of granting recognition to ECAIs. It would appear from the definition of the conditions for recognition, as set out in the CEBS’s conclusions published on 20 January 2006, however, that there will be a strengthening of the barriers to access for new operators and a potential violation of the principle of competition. In its definition of the CEBS’s admission criteria, the Committee points out, inappropriately, in paragraph 76, that ‘stronger market acceptance is not a prerequisite, but rather a factor which is relevant in determining the intensity of assessment of other factors’. In defining the criterion of independence of ECAIs, the CEBS lists, in paragraph 94 et seq., the cases in which there could be a possible conflict of interest, omitting, however, to mention the scenario in which the national authority responsible for recognition of ECAIs has holdings, either directly or indirectly, in the bodies in question. In the light of these considerations regarding real protection of competition, can the Commission say whether: — there is not a need to set out more clearly the conditions for recognition of ECAIs by the national authorities, with a view inter alia to removing barriers to market access? — there is not a need to regard direct or indirect possession by the national authority of holdings in the body applying for recognition as an ECAI as a case of conflict of interests to be added to the list of the conditions which together define the independence criterion?
