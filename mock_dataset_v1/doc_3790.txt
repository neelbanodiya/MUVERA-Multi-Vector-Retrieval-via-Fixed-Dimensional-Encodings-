WRITTEN QUESTION E-0992/08 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (27 February 2008) Subject: Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline In a previous answer to a Question (E‑0020/07) on the Burgas-Alexandroupolis pipeline, the Commission stated that ‘As the planned pipeline will lie in EU territory, its construction and the operation of the pipeline will have to be done in compliance with the Community environmental Directives applicable to this type of major energy projects, in particular concerning the environmental impact of the project (EIA Directive 85/337/EEC OJ L 175, 5.7.1985, p. 40. as amended by 97/11/EC OJ L 73, 14.3.1997, p. 5. and 2003/35/EC OJ L 156, 25.6.2003, p. 17. ) and the special protection areas affected (Birds Directive and Habitats Directive) in particular in relation to impacts on the network of Natura 2000 sites)’. No construction plan for the pipeline, indicating the route it will take and where it will end, and no environmental impact assessment have yet been published. Nevertheless, the project is expected to begin during 2008. Does the Commission know whether a construction plan for the pipeline exists? Have the Greek authorities officially notified the Commission of the plan? If so, is the project to be built close to the Dadia Forest (protected area NATURA‑GR1110002) and the Evros Delta (protected area NATURA‑GR1110006)? Have the Greek authorities officially notified the Commission of the environmental impact assessment for this project? In the Commission's view, how much time is required to draw up an assessment for such a large project?
