ORAL QUESTION H-0605/07 for Question Time at the part-session in September II 2007 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Dimitrios Papadimoulis to the Council Subject: Developments in Kosovo The Secretary-General of the Council, Javier Solana, at a meeting with the UN Secretary-General on 10 July 2007 said, with regard to Kosovo: ‘… any further delay of this issue will not be beneficial’. In addition the French news agency, quoting diplomatic sources, said that Brussels was considering very seriously the possibility of recognising Kosovo but ‘in the most organised way possible’. What are the Council’s comments on these developments? Can it categorically deny the possibility of unilateral recognition, particularly if it anticipates UN procedures in this regard?
