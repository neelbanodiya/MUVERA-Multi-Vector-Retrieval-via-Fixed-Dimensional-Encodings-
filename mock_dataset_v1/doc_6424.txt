9999/C Q999 E/053 WRITTEN QUESTION E-1268/04 by Glyn Ford (PSE) to the Commission (15 April 2004) Subject: Migrants' remittances According to the World Savings Bank Institute (WSBI), the total, official amount of migrants' remittances rose from over US$20 billion in 1998 to about US$100 billion in 2001. Migrant workers often pay as much as 20% of the funds remitted to the institution making the transfer, and the WSBI has estimated that if transfer fees were to be reduced by as little as 5%, net flows of remittances could increase by US$4 billion and their multiplier effect, generally assumed to be three in one, may result in an additional leverage of US$12 billion. 1. Does the Commission have more recent figures of the total amount of migrant workers' remittances? 2. Is data available for remittances made by migrant workers living in the EU? 3. Given that the market for remittances is dominated by one global player which charges excessively high fees for its services, have any initiatives been undertaken at the EU level to counteract this domination and provide a suitable alternative with fees that correspond more to the actual costs of making an international transfer? 4. If nothing has been done at the EU level, have any similar initiatives been undertaken by Member States, acting either alone or in cooperation with one or more Member States?
