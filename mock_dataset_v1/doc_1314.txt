WRITTEN QUESTION E-3464/04 by Philip Claeys (NI) to the Commission (20 December 2004) Subject: Al-Aqsa office in Rotterdam The Al-Aqsa Foundation has opened an office in Rotterdam; it is currently operating as ‘Stichting Jeruzalem’ (‘Jerusalem Foundation’). On 29 May 2003, the US Treasury Department formally designated Al-Aqsa as a terrorist entity, giving full details of the Rotterdam foundation, which was designated a branch of Al-Aqsa. On 30 May 2003, the Bank of England froze the accounts of the Al-Aqsa Foundation, which appears on the list referred to in EU Regulation No 2580/2001 OJ L 344, 28.12.2001, p. 70 . . In reply to questions by Rotterdam City Council member Michiel Smit, the City Council Bureau comprising the Mayor and Aldermen stated that, according to an extract from the Chamber of Commerce company register, ‘Stichting Jeruzalem’ (registered offices at Gerrit van de Lindestraat 103E in Rotterdam) was registered on 24 July 2003 (instrument of incorporation dated 18 July 2003, that ‘Stichting Jeruzalem’ was registered at the same address as the former Al-Aqsa Foundation, and that two former Al-Aqsa Foundation board members were now members of the board of ‘Stichting Jeruzalem’. Rotterdam City Council is taking no action against the office despite every indication that it serves as a base for the financing of terrorism. Is the Commission aware that an Al-Aqsa office has been opened in Rotterdam and that the office now operates as ‘Stichting Jeruzalem’? Has the Netherlands Government already been requested to take action? Will ‘Stichting Jeruzalem’ also be placed on the list of terrorist organisations?
