matter of urgency, not only with a view to guaranteeing security of supply for petroleum products but also on environmental grounds, including use of more fuel-efficient engines and conversion to alternative fuel and propulsion technologies; greater efforts should also be made in the promising area of developing hydrogen and fuel cells; 15. Notes that in order to decrease the oil dependency of the transport sector it is of vital importance to focus on a modal shift from road to rail, inland waterways and/or short sea shipping, thereby promoting and revitalising rail freight as well as rail passenger transport, while also promoting short sea shipping and inland navigation in the EU; 16. Calls on the Commission to take the lead to urge car manufacturers to develop cleaner and less oil-consuming vehicles as a priority in its initiative Cars 21, with the objective of developing a car consuming no more then 3 litres per 100 km at affordable prices for all users; 17. Urges the Commission and the Member States to provide increased financial means for the promotion of safe, environment-friendly, more efficient and cheaper public transport systems, and to promote car-sharing and cycling so that those modes become viable alternatives to individual car use, together with the expansion of public transport and the introduction of incentives for people to use it; 18. Calls on the Commission to submit a proposal on biofuel policy in the transport sector with the aim of increasing the share of biofuel to 15% by 2020; 19. Reaffirms the need to give priority to the security of long-term energy supply, with account being taken of the social and environmental aspects; given that oil requirements worldwide will increase by 2020 to 115 m barrels per day as compared with 77 m per day in 2000, i.e. by 50%, changes must be made in consumption patterns; to eliminate distortions of competition between energy sources, external costs should be internalised; 20. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the EIB, the EBRD, and the Governments and Parliaments of the Member States.
