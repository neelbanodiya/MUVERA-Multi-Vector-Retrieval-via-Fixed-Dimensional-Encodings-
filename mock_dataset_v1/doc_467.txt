2004/C 70 E/238 WRITTEN QUESTION P-3111/03 by Regina Bastos (PPE-DE) to the Commission (17 October 2003) Subject: Possible state or Community subsidies to the German Rieker holding The German Rieker holding recently merged with SCHUH-UNION. Rieker recently relocated its shoe production to Romania, under the name Rieker Romania Ltd. and also relocated production units to Poland and Turkey. It is possible that this company is making use of subsidies from within the European Union to set up in one country, and then move out to other regions or countries so as to obtain fresh subsidies. Were pre-accession subsidies granted to the candidate countries, specifically Poland as a country awaiting accession and possibly Romania as a candidate for accession, with the purpose of modernising the economic fabric? Did Rieker benefit from such aid, specifically from the allocation of Community or state aid from the above countries, where it set up production units? If so, on what dates were these allocations made, and what was their total value?
