WRITTEN QUESTION E-4364/08 by Neil Parish (PPE‑DE) and Daniel Hannan (NI) to the Commission (30 July 2008) Subject: Valencia Development Plans Is the Commission aware that by failing to act in due time against both ongoing ‘urbanistic abuses’ in Valencia and calls for interim measures from the European Court of Justice, it is undermining its strong defence of the public interest taken by its own services since 2005. It is also disregarding the illegal award of development contracts in a framework of urban abuses which has been twice condemned by the plenary of the European Parliament, in December 2005 and in June 2007?
