Question for written answer E-007208/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (21 July 2011) Subject: Influence of anti-Greek feeling on the decisions of the Albanian judiciary It is increasingly to be feared that the Albanian judiciary is affected by the influence of the neo-nationalist organisation Red-Black Alliance and the growing anti-Greek feeling in Albanian society, and makes judgments against people who decide to exchange their Albanian citizenship for Greek citizenship. The prosecutor’s office in Korçë has opened investigations concerning four Albanians who stand accused of having changed their citizenship using fake documents. It should be noted the investigations concern cases where — according to the authorities — the defendants falsely declared themselves Greeks. It is possible that the prosecution will prove the commission of an offence. However, it is strongly suspected that this case is mainly intended to fuel fear within the Greek minority. This is the first time that such investigations have been opened concerning the acquisition of Greek citizenship. 1. Is the internal political situation in Albania free from xenophobia, and specifically anti-Greek feeling? Are human rights being violated? 2. If so, what measures will the Commission take to combat this phenomenon? 3. Does it believe that major intervention in the Albanian justice system is necessary in order to bring the country — which hopes to join the EU — into line with European standards? If so, what steps should the Albanian Government take to do so?
