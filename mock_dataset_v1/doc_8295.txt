Question for written answer E-006572/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Oreste Rossi (EFD) (11 July 2011) Subject: Revision of the Tobacco Products Directive — attractiveness On 22 February 2011, Commissioner Dalli replied on behalf of the Commission to Question E‑011296/2010 from João Ferreira on the possible prohibition of ingredients in the manufacture of tobacco products in the context of the revision of the Tobacco Products Directive (2001/37/EC). Commissioner Dalli's answer to EP Question E‑011296/2010 stated that ‘The Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks adopted an opinion on the attractiveness and addictiveness of tobacco additives on 12 November 2010. The opinion concludes that numerous additives are being used to increase the attractiveness and addictiveness of tobacco products’. Can the Commissioner confirm that the SCENIHR formal opinion answers the questions raised by the Commission (DG SANCO) when it states the following with regard to attractiveness? — ‘However, such studies in human subjects are difficult to carry out due to ethical considerations and the current methods are thus not considered adequate for a reliable quantification of attractiveness in humans’ (page 85 in answer to question 9). — ‘In conclusion, many different additives have been used to increase the attractiveness of tobacco products, but it is very difficult to identify the role of individual additives in enhancing attractiveness’ (page 86 in answer to question 10; emphasis added). — ‘In conclusion, additives have been used largely by the tobacco industry to target specific groups. However, the effect of marketing is probably very important and there is currently a trend in several countries to use products labelled “without additives”’ (page 86 in answer to question 11; emphasis added). If these quotes are accurate, can the Commission explain its reply of 22 February 2011 when the SCENHIR report itself is substantially more nuanced than the Commission answer would suggest?
