Answer given by Mr Piebalgs on behalf of the Commission (21 November 2007) The Commission has received from Greece three reports so far related to Article 3 of Directive 2001/77/EC Directive 2001/77/EC of Parliament and of the Council of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, OJ L 283, 27.10.2001. : in March 2003, in November 2003 and in December 2005. All three reports are available at the Europa homepage: http://ec.europa.eu/energy/res/legislation/electricity_member_states_en.htm The main renewable electricity support schemes in Greece are feed-in tariffs combined with investment incentives. Biofuels are exempted from fossil fuel taxes. In the framework of general renewable energy policy, investment subsidies and tax deductions are available. In particular, Greece provides investment subsidies to renewable energy projects through the operational programme ‘Competitiveness’ under the framework of the Community support framework 2000‑06 for Greece. Since 2003, Greek partners have been participating in 172 projects within the framework of Intelligent Energy Europe. Concerning ongoing renewable energy projects, Greek partners are participating in several projects concerning heat, small scale appliances, alternative fuels and electricity. Within the framework of the EAGGF-funded schemes and, more precisely, the framework of the operational programme ‘Rural Development and Restructuring of Rural Areas 2000-06’, there is no explicit reference to the eligibility of private investments aiming to promote the use of renewable energies. However, investment in innovative environmental measures on agricultural holdings could be used to promote the use of sustainable energy. The 2007‑13 rural development programme for Greece is currently being negotiated and could allow for the eligibility of private investments aiming to promote the use of renewable energies.
