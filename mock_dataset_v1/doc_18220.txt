Question for written answer E-001775/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Willy Meyer (GUE/NGL) (3 March 2011) Subject: Health checks on food and animal feed in Spain On 7 January 2011, the German Government closed 4 700 poultry and pig farms on the grounds that the animals were contaminated with dioxins from the use of contaminated pesticides. Three thousand tonnes of fat that was unfit for animal consumption had been distributed between 12 November and 23 December 2010. In some cases, the dioxin levels in the feed were 77 times higher than the permitted limit, which calls into question the effectiveness of national and European health checks on food and feed. The Commission also confirmed that Germany may have exported batches of eggs ‘produced from contaminated feed’ to Member States such as the UK and the Netherlands, thereby proving once again that Community directives on health checks are ineffective. Does the Commission think that the checks currently carried out in Spain are rigorous enough to ensure that animals are properly fed and to prevent the kind of situation that occurred in Germany? Could the Commission say how many laboratories are responsible for testing animal feed in Spain and whether there are systematic checks to detect dioxins and other prohibited substances so as to ensure that feed is safe? Could the Commission state whether Directive 95/53/EC fixing the principles governing the organisation of official inspections in the field of animal nutrition and Directive 95/69/EC laying down the conditions and arrangements for approving and registering certain establishments and intermediaries operating in the animal feed sector are being properly implemented in Spain? Does the Commission know whether these directives have been or are being infringed in Spain?
