WRITTEN QUESTION E-4774/06 by Cristiana Muscardini (UEN) to the Commission (7 November 2006) Subject: Mobile-phone fraud The Commission is doubtless aware of a new form of fraud devised for mobile phones. It is called ‘smishing’, a contraction of SMS and phishing (which means fraud). We already knew about fraudulent e‑mails sent to PCs, but now it emerges that mobile phones can be subjected to the same treatment, via text messages inviting the recipient to download anti-virus software. In actual fact if one clicks on ‘reply’ a file is downloaded onto the phone containing a virus that, depending on how it is programmed, may render the phone unusable or make it automatically send other fraudulent text messages or can pry into personal data and the address book. As well as protecting their own privacy, mobile phone users want to protect their phones, which can be destroyed if rendered unusable by a fraudulent text message. 1. Can the Commission assess how widespread the ‘smishing’ phenomenon is in the Union? 2. Has it drawn up any proposals and measures to tackle this new example of fraud that is spreading through the ether? 3. Is there a way of involving telecom providers in anti-fraud measures?
