EMPL Implementation of the Services Directive 2006/123/EC (Bennahmias - ALDE) The rapporteur presented his draft and points out that the directive has to be interpreted in the light of the new provisions of the Treaties, in particular article 3 TEU, the horizontal social clause of Article 9 TFEU, and Protocol 26 annexed to the Treaties, as well as of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. He takes the view that some clarification is still needed about key concepts so a clear delimitation is made of the precise scope of the directive and reminds that some important sectors must be considered as excluded from its scope, such as health care, non-economic services of general interest and most of social services of general interest. He hopes that the directive will have a positive impact on job creation and improved quality and security of the services offered. Members generally agreed with the main points raised in the draft opinion and insisted on the need to clearly delimitate the scope of the directive so that, for example, it does not encroach upon social services of general interest. 20100914CAN82228
