WRITTEN QUESTION E-4099/07 by Alyn Smith (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (3 August 2007) Subject: The Eurocet project The Eurocet project was set up, in part, to collect and publish official and updated figures on organ donation and transplantation activities. It was funded under the now expired e-TEN programme of the European Commission. Eurocet started on 1 September 2005 for 18 months' duration, with a consortium made by 20 partners coming from 12 different Member States. The project included an inter-exchange portal to assist patients in sharing know-how and helpful contacts and a constantly-updated registry on donation and transplantation activity. Does the Commission not consider that these could be useful tools in the consultation programme that is currently underway regarding the formulation of an action plan and a directive on the quality and safety of organs? Does the Commission consider that the Eurocet project should be ongoing as part of the many initiatives that are assisting in the establishment of the quality and safety framework?
