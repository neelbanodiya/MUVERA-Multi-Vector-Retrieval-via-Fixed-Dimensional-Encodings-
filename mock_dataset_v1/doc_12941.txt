Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (9 January 2012) The Commission supports the Council conclusions of 7 December 2010 See http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_Data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/118273.pdf where it is stated that one of the key policy challenges to be addressed by Member States is ‘ensuring the cost-effective use of medicines through better information, pricing and reimbursement practices and effectiveness assessment’. Moreover, the Commission believes that, generics have the potential to control expenditure growth while ensuring access to healthcare through ‘encouraging the use of generics by speeding the access of generics to markets, encouraging generic prescription, substitution and price competition’ as stated in the joint EPC-Commission publication from 2010 on health systems See http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/occasional_paper/2010/pdf/ocp74_en.pdf . However, Article 168 para. 7 of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union makes it clear that the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care is a competence held by Member States. Consequently, the reference made to the ‘International Non-proprietary Name’ in Article 11 of the Cross-Border Health Directive, is not intended as a possible measure to promote the use of generics but rather as a means for identification of medicinal products or medical devices prescribed in one Member State and dispensed in another. It is up to Member States to promote the use of generics through regulations addressing pricing and reimbursement.
