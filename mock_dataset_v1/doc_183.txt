the purposes of direct marketing, and to be expressly offered the right to object free of charge to such disclosures or uses’. In the special case of the direct marketing pursued by electronic communications, the directive on privacy and electronic communications Directive 2002/58/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector, OJ L 201, 31.7.2002. contains one specific rule that electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing may only be allowed in respect of subscribers who have given their prior consent. Only in the context of the sale of a product or a service, and in accordance with the Data Protection Directive, may the same natural or legal person use electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services provided that customers clearly and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use. According to the legal framework described above, it is not always the case that such marketing without consent may amount to a breach of national law. If such breaches are suspected, though, the remedies provided for in the Data Protection Directive may be activated, namely the interventions of the national data protection authority. The Commission will draw the attention of the Irish data protection commissioner, Mr Billy Hawkes, to the facts spelled out in the Honourable Member’s question.
