WRITTEN QUESTION E-2450/09 by Luca Romagnoli (NI) to the Commission (8 April 2009) Subject: Information on the use of Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows programme funds by the municipality of Fano For the Community programming period 2007‑13 numerous financing programmes have been developed; with these programmes the European Union intends to support projects under various sectoral policies. The municipality of Fano (Marche, Italy) needs funding for the integration of immigrants so as to promote their better integration into the local community, develop new strategies for greater involvement of immigrants in public life and foster the exchange of good practices and experience. Given the above, can the Commission clarify whether the municipality of Fano has submitted any projects under the Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows programme? If so, could the Commission say whether the municipality of Fano has obtained any financing and if it has been used in the correct way and within the proper time frame or whether the subsidies have had to be reimbursed?
