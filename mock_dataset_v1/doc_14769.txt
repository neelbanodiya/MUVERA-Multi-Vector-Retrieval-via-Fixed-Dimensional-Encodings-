Question for written answer E-000688/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Ana Miranda (Verts/ALE) (31 January 2012) Subject: Situation of Galicia's shipping industry The European Commission has responded, through the Commissioner for Competition, Joaquín Almunia, to Question E‑007729/2011 that the Commission has launched a detailed investigation intended to verify the compatibility of the Spanish system of financial leasing for the purchase of boats with Union rules on state aid, and that the Commission is aware of the social implications of this issue, but should also bear in mind the repercussions that these measures have on competition and on other companies. In the European Union, financial interests and competition rules are increasingly taking precedence over the interests of society, and of territorial, social and economic cohesion. The shipping industry is suffering these consequences, since, instead of being supported as a strategic sector in Europe, it is facing constant constraints. In particular, Galicia's shipping industry has been clearly marginalised over the past two decades, even though it is competitive, technically advanced, has a skilled workforce, is highly specialised and has adapted its production to new developments. The crisis currently affecting productive sectors has hit the shipping industry hard, and its viability is dependent on finance. At the moment, Galicia's shipping sector is at a standstill, awaiting the Commission's response to the Spanish Government's position. — Can the Commission provide information about the current status of the investigation on the tax regime applied to the Spanish tax lease system? — When will the Commission respond to this investigation? — Does the Commission believe it will be able to find a solution fair to the interests of a productive sector such as Galicia's shipping sector, providing it with a financial system that supports it in order to ensure its continuity, viability and future?
