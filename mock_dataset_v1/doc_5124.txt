Answer given by Mr Dalli on behalf of the Commission (22 December 2010) The Commission supports Member States' efforts to address cardiovascular diseases through a range of actions on the main causes of these diseases, such as smoking, nutrition, physical activity and alcohol. However, at this stage, the Commission does not plan to develop a specific EU strategy against cardiovascular diseases. To encourage the adoption of good practice in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, the Commission is supporting the European Heart Health Charter, which calls for the implementation of comprehensive health strategies and policies that promote cardiovascular health and prevent cardiovascular diseases http://www.escardio.org/about/what/advocacy/Pages/health-charter.aspx . The Commission is also developing comparable indicators for cardiovascular diseases monitoring, and cardiovascular mortality comparable data. In addition, the Commission supports awareness raising activities about cardiovascular diseases. At European level, research on stroke prevention as well as other cardiovascular diseases is one of the health-related priority areas under the EU 7th Framework Programme for Research (2007‑13) http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/health/home_en.html . The Commission is currently supporting 25 research projects with an EU contribution of over EUR 130 million in 2007‑10 http://ec.europa.eu/research/health/medical-research/cardiovascular-diseases/index_en.html . Such projects will contribute to better diagnostic methods and algorithms, new treatments, better care and prevention strategies for cardiovascular diseases. Of these, EUR 21 million is specifically devoted to support research on stroke and its prevention through the European Stroke Network, a common effort undertaken by the EUSTROKE and ARISE projects EUSTROKE (European Stroke Research Network, http://www.eustroke.com/); European Stroke Network (http://www.europeanstrokenetwork.info/); ARISE (http://www.arise-europe.net/index-preview.php). . This initiative tackles issues such as the development of stroke prevention approaches, the improvement of the safety of existing therapies, the development of therapies, and the study of neuroprotection mechanisms.
