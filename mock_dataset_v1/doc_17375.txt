in leading at national level a Europe-wide interactive, structured and coordinated debate on the future of Europe and the Constitutional Treaty, and encourage discussion at regional and local level as well; 7. Takes the view that the phase of reflection should be used, on the one hand, to ensure that citizens are fully informed, not only about the Constitution itself, but also about the existing Treaties, and on the other hand to clarify, broaden and democratise the consensus around the Constitution by finding solutions to existing problems such as immigration, demography and employment and to provide a representative profile of the opinions of citizens by means of public opinion polls (Eurobarometer); 8. Recommends broadening the debate to include questions, with the participation of all European citizens, about the future of Europe and issues that were at the heart of the referenda campaigns, such as the aim of European integration, Europe's role in the world and the future of the European social and economic model; 9. Recommends that women's NGOs and women's fora be supported, in order to enhance the dialogue on the Constitutional treaty, with the aim of ensuring that women receive clear information on the impact that the Constitutional treaty would have on, and the contribution it would make to, the daily lives of European citizens; 10. Reminds the Member States that any dialogue on the European venture must necessarily include a recognition, as a fundamental value, of the equality of women and men, in the knowledge that this equality is a vector of peace, freedom, justice and social progress; 11. Recalls that the dream of a great, united Europe must be realised not only on the basis of converging economic aspirations and interests, but also on that of values shared by all European citizens, because it is these true values that will give Europe its own identity and enable it to assume its responsibilities on the global stage; 12. Insists that any reflection on the future of Europe must be based on respect for "unity in diversity" and gender equality, and that the fight against all forms of discrimination must be upheld.
