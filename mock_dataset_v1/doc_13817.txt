given in response to recommendations by the Ombudsman about its relations with complainants ( COM (2002) 141 final), but regrets that these commitments fall short of keeping complainants fully informed of the progress of their complaints and copying to complainants all correspondence exchanged between the Commission and Member States in pursuance of their complaint; 3. Welcomes the Commission's resolve, stated in SEC (2003) 804, to ensure, especially in case of environmental law, that Community rules are 'enforcement friendly', that guidelines and interpretative texts are prepared in consultation with all stakeholders, that there is proactive contact with member States (including, it is hoped, their relevant regional authorities), and that use is made of the informal EU network on Implementing Environmental Law; 4. Generally, supports the Commission's efforts to solve transpositional problems proactively rather than reactively; 5. Repeats its desire to see enhanced cooperation between parliamentarians in the European Parliament and Parliaments of Member States, including where appropriate regional or other internal ones, to aid and increase effective scrutiny at the national level of European matters; considers that parliaments at all levels have a valuable role to play in the monitoring of the application of Community law, thus helping to strengthen the democratic legitimacy of the Union and bring it closer to the citizens; 6. Therefore repeats its recommendation to the Commission to send its annual reports on monitoring the application of Community law to the national parliaments, also for further transmission as may be appropriate to relevant internal parliaments; 7. Deplores the fact that, notwithstanding assiduous activity by the Commission to ensure proper application of Community law, there remain glaring examples of drawn-out and pertinacious failure by Member States to comply with declared obligations, thereby undermining the ideal of the Union as a community-under-law; 8. Welcomes the Commission's intention to give priority to infringement proceedings under Article 228 EC, and to reinforce the machinery at its disposal for performing its task of monitoring the implementation of Community law; 9. Calls again on the Commission to set short deadlines for the pre-litigation phase of the procedure for breach, which should be concluded by a predefined deadline, to be set right from the outset; 10. Recalls that petitions forwarded by individuals to the Commission, to the Ombudsman and to Parliament's relevant committees enable the European Union to assess the way in which Community law is being implemented at national and European level; 11.
