the EU's subsidies landscape that is out of date and has been overtaken by the continuous wave of internal reforms of the EU CAP policy. The EU has moved towards a more sustainable agricultural production which reflects the concerns of consumers, particularly as regards quality, safety and traditional and organic production methods. The guiding principle behind this development is quality which means food safety, compliance with established standards for the environment and animal welfare and other aspects such as nutritional value, flavour and appearance, thus the importance of the EU quality label systems. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) of course play an important part in the civil society debate on public policy.
