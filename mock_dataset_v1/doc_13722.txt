ORAL QUESTION H-0629/02 for Question Time at the part-session in October 2002 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Lennart Sacrédeus to the Council Subject: Neighbouring country status for Ukraine At the EU-Ukraine summit held in Copenhagen in July 2002, Ukraine was offered EU neighbouring country status. This is a new concept which now needs to be given substance. What does this status entail in practical terms? Will conditions be the same for Ukraine as for Belarus, for example? Will the same status apply to all countries that border the Union after enlargement?
