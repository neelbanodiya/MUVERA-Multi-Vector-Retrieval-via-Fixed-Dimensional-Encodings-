Question for written answer E-5247/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Christophe Béchu (PPE) (8 July 2010) Subject: Deforestation and regulation of tree-felling The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union agreed on 15 June 2010 on a new law that radically penalises illegal tree-felling in Europe and the rest of the world by banning the sale of wood resulting from such felling in the single market. The traceability of stocks of wood and derived products is to be reinforced with the help of importers and retailers of these products, who will be encouraged to invest in more sustainable tree-felling practices. In order to achieve this aim, it is necessary to deploy an arsenal of effective, proportionate, dissuasive penalties. How does the Commission envisage this regulatory system? Will it support the introduction of penalties commensurate with the task of eradicating the phenomenon of illegal deforestation effectively?
