matters of culture, the Lisbon Treaty grants the European Union a role of support, coordination and complementary action but does not confer on it any competence to intervene instead of the Member States or to sanction them. As far as language is concerned, the Commission pursues a strategy to develop multilingualism in the European Union. It promotes minority languages and works in close cooperation with the Member States, which however remain the decision‑makers with respect to their internal language policy, subject to the review of the courts having jurisdiction.
