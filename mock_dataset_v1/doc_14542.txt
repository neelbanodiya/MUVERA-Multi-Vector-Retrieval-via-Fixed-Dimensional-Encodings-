WRITTEN QUESTION E-4512/09 by Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) to the Commission (25 September 2009) Subject: Anchovy fishing season, TAC and quotas In 2005, the European Commission proposed a ban on anchovy fishing until such time as scientific research showed that population levels had increased to such an extent that fishing could restart. After a closure lasting four years, broken by a partial lifting of the ban in 2006, Basque and Community fishermen find themselves at a decisive juncture for anchovy fishing. Many communities and families on the Cantabrian coast depend on anchovy fishing for their livelihood, and in recent years, on top of the closure, have been in the throes of vessel conversion. According to the latest scientific studies, there would appear to have been regeneration of the biomass, and several organisations have called for the ban on fishing to be lifted. In the proposal it adopted on 29 July 2009, the Commission established a long‑term plan for the management of the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay, stressing that the aim of the plan is to maintain that population at a level which allows it to be exploited sustainably while simultaneously ensuring stability and profitability for the fishing sector. Can the Commission indicate how it intends to put this new long‑term plan into practice? Does it consider that this new approach will resolve the problems arising from the system of TACs and quotas, which are being set in December? Does it not believe that the new common fisheries policy must seek to find solutions in respect of closures, such as that for anchovy fishing, which can be applied to other at‑risk species?
