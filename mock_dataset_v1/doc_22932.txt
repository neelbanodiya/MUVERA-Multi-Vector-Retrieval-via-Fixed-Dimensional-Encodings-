WRITTEN QUESTION E-2165/09 by Glenis Willmott (PSE) to the Commission (31 March 2009) Subject: Pig-tail docking Following the reply given by the Commission to the written question by my colleague Richard Corbett MEP ‘on abuse of the Council Directive preventing pig-tail docking’ (E‑0784/08), in which Commissioner Vassiliou gave information that the Commission was to launch a pilot project in order to avoid the frequent recurrence of the practice of pig-tail docking, can the Commission give an update on the success of this project and state whether it is still the shameful case that 90 % of pigs in the EU are having their tails docked, in spite of Council Directive 91/630/EEC OJ L 340, 11.12.1991, p. 33. prohibiting this practice as a routine measure?
