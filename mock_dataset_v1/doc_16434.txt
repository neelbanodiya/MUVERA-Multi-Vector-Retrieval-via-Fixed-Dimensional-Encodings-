the non-ionic surfactants by ion exchange The purpose of the alcoholic extraction is to eliminate the insoluble and inorganic ingredients of the commercial product, which in some circumstances might upset the biodegradability test. 5.1.2. Ion-exchange procedure Isolation and separation of non-ionic surface active agents from soap, anionic and cationic surfactants are required for correct biodegradability tests. This is achieved by an ion exchange technique using a macro-porous exchange resin and suitable eluants for fractional elution. Thus soap, anionic and non-ionic surfactants may be isolated in one procedure. 5.1.3. Analytical control After homogenising, the concentration of anionic and non-ionic surfactants in the detergent is determined according to the MBAS and BiAS analytical procedure. The soap content is determined by a suitable analytical method. This analysis of the product is necessary to calculate the quantities required preparing fractions for the biodegradability tests. Quantitative extraction is not necessary; however, at least 80% of the non-ionic surfactants should be extracted. Usually, 90% or more is obtained. 5.2. Principle From a homogeneous sample (powders, dried paste and dried liquids) an ethanol extract is obtained which contains the surfactants, soap and other alcohol-soluble constituents of the detergent sample. The ethanol extract is evaporated to dryness, dissolved in an isopropanol/water mixture and the solution obtained is passed through a strongly acidic cation exchange/macro-porous anion exchange combination heated to 50 °C. This temperature is necessary to prevent the precipitation of any fatty acids which may be present in acidic media. The non-ionic surfactants are obtained from the effluent by evaporation. Cationic surfactants, which might upset the degradation test and the analytical procedure, are eliminated by the cation exchanger placed above the anion exchanger. 5.3. Chemicals and equipment 5.3.1.
