Invites the Commission, in conjunction with the Member States and after consulting both sides of industry, to analyse developments, innovation and progress achieved towards the above objectives and to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council appropriate reports on the quality of jobs, labour market efficiency, productivity, taxation and social protection systems in respect of all economic sectors; 22.
