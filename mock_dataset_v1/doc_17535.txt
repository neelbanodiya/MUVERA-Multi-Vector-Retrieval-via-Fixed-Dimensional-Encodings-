framework for present and future agencies should be negotiated. Agencies beyond 2006 28. In its resolution on Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the enlarged Union 2007-2013 P6_TA-PROV(2005)0224 -8 June 2005 Parliament has tried to carry out an evaluation of the needs for agencies over the coming period although the Commission itself was unable to provide any reliable financial programming. In absence of more precise forecasts, the evaluation made by the Temporary Committee in its final report was based on the amount dedicated to the existing agencies in the 2005 Budget with a 2 % deflator, resulting in an overall amount of EUR 2,3 billion for seven years. This amount is likely underestimated, considering the figures entered for the agencies in the PDB for 2006 and does not include any margin for new agencies. 29. On its side the committee on Budgets standing rapporteur for the agencies has informally asked the agencies for their estimates. According to the answers received, the annual needs for agencies could raise to EUR 500 million in 2013, on a a purely indicative basis. The increase of staff follows the same trend: 2.764 posts in 2005 could raise to 3840 posts in 2013. 30. On 8 June, the European Parliament adopted the report BÖGE P6_TA-PROV(2005)0224 -8 June 2005 , as its negotiating position for the next financial framework with a global level of 1,18 % in CA and 1,07 % in payments of Members States GNI, which represents a reduction of EUR 47,5 billion compared to the Commission’s proposal. In case the European Council succeeds to reach an agreement on 16-17 June, the ceiling will be even lower. Whatever will be the final agreement between EP and Council on the future financial framework, the rapporteur underlines that the agencies will necessarily participate to the reduction. 31. More specifically, the resolution deplored the fact that the Commission had not been able to provide details of multi-annual programming for agencies over the next financial framework. The development of agencies should in future be continuously examined by both the budgetary and legislative authorities, not only because of the administrative burden decentralised bodies create for the budget, but also because of the risk of intergovernmental influence on common policies through the presence of Member States' representatives on their management boards and the lack of democratic accountability to the European Parliament. 32. Moreover, it called for an approach similar to
