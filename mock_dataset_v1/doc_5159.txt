WRITTEN QUESTION P-2302/05 by Ivo Belet (PPE-DE) to the Commission (21 June 2005) Subject: Control of the acquisition and possession of weapons The Commission report on the application of Council Directive 91/477/EEC OJ L 256, 13.9.1991, p. 51 . of 18 June 1991 on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons ( COM(2000)837 ) states that the Commission will be putting forward legislative proposals early in 2002. Any amendment of the directive would, according to the Commission, be likely to take the form of clarifying the wording of the main provisions, rather than of substantial changes, to ensure that the directive is implemented throughout the Community in the same way. Can the Commission explain what proposals or other initiatives it has taken to ensure that the directive is implemented throughout the Community in the same way? The 2000 report refers to the situation in the EU of the 15. Will the Commission be assessing the situation in the EU of the 25?
