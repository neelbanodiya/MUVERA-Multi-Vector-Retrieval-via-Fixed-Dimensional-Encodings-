Question for written answer E-004222/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Marc Tarabella (S&D) (2 May 2011) Subject: Worrying results of ‘Eurobarometer’ survey on consumer behaviour The latest ‘Eurobarometer’ survey from April 2011 on EU consumer behaviour clearly highlights the complete lack of confidence, information and protection experienced by EU consumers. The Commission has in fact already admitted as much. On 11 April 2011, Commissioner Dalli said that ‘these results will have to be taken into account if we want to help consumers in an increasingly complex market and in the face of information overload.’ The Commissioner added that ‘worrying results indicate that a significant number of consumers are potentially vulnerable to frauds, scams, pressure selling, etc’. Does the Commission consider the detailed conclusions to be an admission of the failure of its EU consumer policy? Does the Commission agree that it needs to reconsider its policy priorities for coming years rather than making do with only one of the twelve ‘levers to boost growth and strengthen confidence’, which looks, superficially and very vaguely, into ‘consumer empowerment’? Does the Commission agree that it should also fully review its budgetary priorities to take into account the huge dearth of consumer information, especially for the most vulnerable, so as to dedicate a much more substantial part of the budget to consumer organisations and consumer information policy? Does the Commission agree that it should do so by dropping extremely questionable spending projects which in no way improve the situation for consumers, particularly the most vulnerable, such as the ‘Consumer Markets Scoreboard’, which is very expensive and of no relevance to the daily life of consumers?
