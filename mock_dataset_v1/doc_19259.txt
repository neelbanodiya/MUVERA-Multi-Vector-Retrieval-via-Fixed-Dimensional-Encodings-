Answer given by Mr Füle on behalf of the Commission (16 February 2011) The Commission considers that the European Neighbourhood Policy has resulted in the approximation of partners’ legislation towards EU standards in many fields, and it has facilitated increased trade flows between the EU and its partners. On the other, it has not brought about the degree of progress we had wished towards democracy, rule of law and respect of human rights in our neighbourhood. As the Commission pointed out in its communication ‘Taking Stock of the European Neighbourhood Policy’ of 12 May 2010 COM(2010)207; http://ec.europa.eu/world/enp/pdf/progress2010 , the pace of progress is determined by the degree to which partners have been willing to undertake the necessary reforms, which also depends on the benefits that the partners can expect within a reasonable time frame. The Commission counts on Parliament’s support to provide partners with the appropriate incentives. HR/VP Ashton and Commissioner Füle have undertaken broad-ranging consultations to review the European Neighbourhood Policy. Commissioner Füle discussed this review with the Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) on 26 October 2010 and on 26 January 2011. The outcome of the consultation process will be reflected in a Commission Communication that the Commission will discuss with Council and Parliament in the first half of 2011.
