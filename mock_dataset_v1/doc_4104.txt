Question for written answer E-004105/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Jaroslav Paška (EFD) (3 May 2011) Subject: Is it possible for Slovak ‘professional parents’ fostering foreign children to be granted rights equal to those of other employees in the Slovak Republic under the terms of European employment legislation? Pursuant to Article 20(1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989 ‘A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State.’ One of the forms of state institutional care and assistance for such children in the Slovak Republic is professional parenthood, whereby children, pursuant to Article 20(1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, are brought up by substitute, ‘professional’ parents. Pursuant to the Labour Code in the Slovak Republic, professional parents are paid by the state as employees, but they are not granted all the rights of employees in accordance with that law. For example, their working hours are not limited to 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week, they have no entitlement to time off at the weekend, they have no entitlement to holidays, etc. Their working methods are not covered by employment law. Some of these professional parents bringing up foreign children entrusted to them by the state in their own family environment are demanding equal working conditions with respect to the children entrusted to them, as defined in the Labour Code for normal employment relationships. They want to have their working hours with respect to the children limited to 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week, entitlement to time off at the weekend, entitlement to holidays, etc., which is in practice incompatible with their parental position with respect to the children entrusted to them, for which the state duly pays them. I am therefore asking whether Slovak ‘professional parents’ bringing up foreign children entrusted to them by the state would be able to find support for such a request for a reduction in the care given to the children entrusted to them in any of the provisions of European Union employment legislation?
