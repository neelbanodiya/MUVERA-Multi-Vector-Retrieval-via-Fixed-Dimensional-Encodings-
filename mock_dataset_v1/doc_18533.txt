take advantage of any improvement in overall security by assisting the Government to reinforce the business climate in Afghanistan. An effective legal system and investor protection will be essential. 3. In 2008 on the occasion of an international donor conference in Paris, Afghanistan adopted the Afghan National Development Strategy (ANDS), which also serves as Afghanistan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The Kabul conference in July 2010 foresaw a number of actions which would prioritise the objectives in the ANDS with a view to speedy implementation. 4. Civil society organisations are essential partners in the implementation of EU assistance (e.g. in health, social protection or agriculture) and key partners in dialogue on assistance strategies. The mid‑term review of the Country Strategy Paper for Afghanistan foresaw a specific consultation with Afghanistan's civil society. In addition to the bilateral programmes, EU support to civil society includes a human rights programme and funding of activities through calls for proposals for non-state actors, with a particular focus on supporting the active role of women in the development agenda of Afghanistan, especially at the local and sub-national levels. Other areas of EU support to civil society include funding for projects linking relief, rehabilitation and development through food security interventions. For more detailed information, the Commission transmits a State of Play of EU assistance twice a year to the Parliament.
