Answer given by Mrs Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (8 October 2008) The Commission monitors the developments closely in Iraq, including via its Delegation in Baghdad. While reports of increased stability are common, the widespread violence and insecurity affecting many Iraqis continue to be of great concern. The Commission uses many occasions to raise with Iraqi government representatives the need for all actors to refrain from violence and respect human rights. The absence of a system of rule of law and a human rights culture are of such significance that the Commission addresses these systematically in a dialogue with the Iraqi authorities. Rule of law and human rights will also be prominent elements of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement that is currently under negotiations with Iraq. The Commission has taken full note of the case of Dr Al Zubaydi, as contained in the press report the Honourable Member has forwarded to it. Before raising a specific case with the authorities of any country, the Commission, with the EU Member States, has a duty to be in possession of prima facie evidence — thoroughly corroborated reports — which indicate that an individual’s rights have been violated. Attempts by the Commission to further establish facts on this specific case have so far not produced sufficient evidence for the Commission to approach the Iraqi authorities. The Commission will however raise this case with EU Member States with a view to seeking more information, and establishing a common assessment.
