Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (16 March 2010) The Commission does not have any evidence that the Irish Government forbids Irish citizens who are resident in Ireland from buying health insurance policies from UK health insurance companies. In Ireland, private health insurance serves as a partial or complete alternative to the health cover provided by the social security system. According to Article 54 of the Third Non-life Insurance Directive 92/49/EEC Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life assurance and amending Directives 73/239/EEC and 88/357/EEC (third non-life insurance Directive), OJ L 228, 11.8.1992. , Ireland may therefore require that health insurance contracts comply with the specific legal provisions which protect the general good in health insurance. In Ireland, specific legal provisions concerning general good were introduced by the Health Insurance Act, 1994 (No 16 of 1994). According to the Act, a health insurance undertaking must among others provide for community rated health insurance contracts, may not refuse to underwrite them, may not terminate or refuse to renew them and must assure a minimum level of insurance cover. According to the Third Non-life Insurance Directive, a UK insurance company can sell health insurance contracts to Irish citizens who are resident in Ireland provided the contracts comply with the general good provisions in Ireland.
