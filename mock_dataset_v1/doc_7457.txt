WRITTEN QUESTION E-2164/07 by Roberto Musacchio (GUE/NGL) and Sepp Kusstatscher (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (24 April 2007) Subject: Measures to protect Venice — MOSE project — single contractor The uniqueness of the city of Venice and the need to ensure the protection of the entire lagoon basin are a major concern not only for Italy but also for Europe as a whole. Currently, preliminary operations in the MOSE project are being conducted on an ongoing basis, although they have not yet reached the non-reversible stage. Moreover, the single-contractor arrangement (a single operator to study, plan and carry out the project) has given rise to a large number of controversies and proceedings, including action by the Commission. Does the Commission consider that the current situation regarding tender procedures for the work is in keeping with current EU legislation on competition and the settlement negotiated by the Commission and the Italian Government in 2002 following the infringement proceedings? What measures has the Commission taken to ensure that the settlement negotiated in 2002 is being complied with? What action does the Commission intend to take to check the regularity of contract award procedures?
