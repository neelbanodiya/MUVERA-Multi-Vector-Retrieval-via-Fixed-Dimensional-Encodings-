Question for written answer E-000874/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Niki Tzavela (EFD) (2 February 2012) Subject: South Stream pipeline According to Greek press reports, the construction of the South Stream pipeline will begin in December 2012 instead of 2013 as previously thought. In total, South Stream is expected to cover a distance of 3 600 kilometres. Crossing the Balkan Peninsula, South Stream will have networks in Greece and Italy, from whence it will reach western Europe. It will not pass through Ukraine at all. Will the Commission say whether this pipeline can cover the needs of southern Europe? Is Russia a strategic partner for Europe in this undertaking?
