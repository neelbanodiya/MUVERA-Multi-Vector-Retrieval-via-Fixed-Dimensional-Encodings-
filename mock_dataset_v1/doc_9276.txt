WRITTEN QUESTION E-3118/06 by Georgios Karatzaferis (IND/DEM) to the Commission (10 July 2006) Subject: Commission office in occupied Nicosia and actions by the Commissioners According to reports from top journalists in Brussels (such as the very experienced Georgios Daratos), the Commission is opening an office in the occupied city of Nicosia, following a decision taken on 23.6.2006 by the ‘written procedure’ under which the text of the decision is approved and initialled by each Commissioner separately, without discussion. Reports from Brussels state that the text was also approved by the Cypriot Commissioner, Mr Kyprianou and apparently by the Greek Commissioner Mr Dimas, despite the understandable concerns voiced for years that such a step amounts to recognition of the pseudo-state whose basic foundations are based on the Turkish army of occupation and the racist division of the inhabitants of Cyprus into two zones. Will the Commission say why Commissioners Dimas and Kyprianou gave the go-ahead to the opening of this office in the occupied territories, thereby withdrawing tens of millions of euros (paid by European taxpayers) from the control of the legitimate Government of Cyprus?
