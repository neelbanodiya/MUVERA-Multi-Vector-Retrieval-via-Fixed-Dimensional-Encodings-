WRITTEN QUESTION E-1585/06 by Edward McMillan-Scott (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (12 April 2006) Subject: Hill farm subsidies Do the bands for hill farm subsidies in all Member States follow the same proportions as in the UK, namely GBP 22.90 per hectare for moorland, GBP 161 per hectare for severely disadvantaged areas, GBP 195 per hectare for disadvantaged lowland areas and, if so, does this constitutes a fair distribution of EU support?
