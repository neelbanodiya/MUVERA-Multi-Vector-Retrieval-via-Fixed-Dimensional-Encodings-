issues. Regarding differences in the legislation in force in the various Member States and the confusion such differences could engender in citizens travelling abroad the Commission has developed a website dedicated to road safety with a specific page on ‘going abroad’ with a synopsis of traffic rules in all EU Member States, including drivers' allowed blood alcohol content (cf. http://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/observatory/doc/alcohol_rules.pdf). This information is updated when new legislation enters into force. The Commission has released in April 2010 a Eurobarometer on EU citizens' attitudes towards alcohol http://ec.europa.eu/health/alcohol/docs/ebs_331_en.pdf . Some questions aimed at considering EU citizens' awareness of risk and harm when drinking and driving. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) has also released a road traffic database that provides useful breakdowns such as accidents ‘under the influence of alcohol’ http://w3.unece.org/pxweb/DATABASE/STAT/40-TRTRANS/01-TRACCIDENTS/01-TRACCIDENTS.asp .
