Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (21 December 2007) The Commission does not have legal powers to deal with issues related to property restitution. Questions of property restitution are to be considered under the relevant national law. National authorities and courts, together with the European Court of Human Rights, may consider individual cases.
