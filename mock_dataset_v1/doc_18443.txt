WRITTEN QUESTION P-1992/06 by Carlos Coelho (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 May 2006) Subject: Exploitation of temporary workers A number of press reports, as well as reports by the Federation of the Portuguese Community in the Netherlands, have highlighted the many cases of exploitation and near-slavery conditions suffered by seasonal workers recruited in Portugal by labour subcontracting firms. This is a large-scale problem. In the specific case of the Netherlands, the authorities estimate that between 6000 and 7000 firms use workers posted from other European Union countries. The directive on the posting of workers, which aims to create a legal framework that will favour mobility for such workers, prohibits any abuse and guarantees respect for certain minimum conditions (pay, health, safety, hygiene, working time, etc.), contains too many loopholes. Nevertheless, the directive does lay down minimum obligations which each Member State has transposed into national law. How can the Commission justify this enormous gap between the existing — albeit imperfect — legal framework and the reality of the situation as regards the importing of temporary labour not just in the Netherlands but also in other Member States? Most of the situations described clearly amount to people-trafficking, which is completely illegal under Dutch, Portuguese and indeed Community law. In this context, what steps does the Commission recommend so that such situations can be eradicated?
