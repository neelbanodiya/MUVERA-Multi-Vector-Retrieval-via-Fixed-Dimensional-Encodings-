Answer given by Mrs Diamantopoulou on behalf of the Commission (20 November 2003) Article 2 of the Council Decision 2001/903/EC of 3 December 2001 establishing the European Year of People with Disabilities (EYPD) OJ L 335, 19.12.2001 . defines the objectives of the European Year. These include awareness raising, exchange of good practice and reinforcement of co-operation between the various stakeholders. Article 11 stipulates EUR 12 million as the available budget for the EYPD. It can already be said now that the EYPD is successful in achieving its objectives. The enthusiasm of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and other stakeholders is reflected through thousands of activities that are being implemented in 2003. One consequence of the great interest in the EYPD is that not all activities could be supported within the given financial framework. The EYPD is, however, not an end in itself. The Commission as well as all Member States are dedicated to making sure that the EYPD is properly followed up. Portugal for example intends to present a new fundamental and general law on disability and chronic illness; a law on non-governmental organisations representing people with disabilities and people with chronic illnesses and a national action plan promoting accessibility (2004-2011). The Commission has issued a Communication on the follow up to the EYPD that introduces a rolling multi-annual Action Plan with the time horizon of 2010. The goal of the Action Plan is to mainstream disability issues into relevant Community policies and develop concrete actions in crucial areas to enhance the integration of people with disabilities. Three overall objectives are central to the proposed approach: achieving full application of Council Directive ( 2000/78/EC ) Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, OJ L 303, 2.12.2000 . , reinforcing mainstreaming of disability issues in relevant Community policies, and improving accessibility for all. With regard to a Disability Directive based on Article 13 the Commission considers — as outlined in the response to Written Question E-2112/20 03 by Mr de Rossa OJ C 11 E, 15.1.2004, p. 248 . — that the current priority is to ensure that the existing Community legislation (Directive 2000/78/EC ) is fully transposed into national law. In so far as the future of Union anti-discrimination policy is concerned, the Commission intends to launch a public consultation (Green Paper) in spring 2004 on the future strategy to
