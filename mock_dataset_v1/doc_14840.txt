of supervisory practices and standards could diminish some of the negative effects of diverging supervisory practices and improve market efficiency; welcomes the progress achieved by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors and encourages its further work; 19. Welcomes the progress attained by Level 3 committees - the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) - in achieving greater supervisory convergence and encourages their further work; 20. Notes that the integration on the wholesale markets has been nearly completed and, in particular, that integration on the money markets is far advanced, and that announcements of increases and decreases in interest rates are quickly and well reflected in the market prices; 21. Regrets that several tax obstacles, in particular inter-group VAT and the lack of neutrality as well as the lack of legal certainty in the VAT treatment of financial services, diminish and often prevent synergies and cost efficiencies and calls on the Commission to formulate proposals on how to overcome these barriers; 22. Notes that currently, substantial non-recoverable VAT costs in addition to inter-company charges to a large extent limit any possible savings from cross-border consolidation; 23. Notes that the current tax treatment of dividends in some Member States favours payouts of domestic rather than EU dividends; 24. Believes that further integration of the retail financial markets should bring greater choice of better quality products for consumers and should enable companies to sell their products across borders, without hampering competition within the EU retail financial markets; calls on the Commission to present a clear and concise strategy for integrating retail financial markets; 25. Urges the Commission and the financial services industry to discuss further the advantages and disadvantages of the '26th regime' to financial services, which mobile EU citizens may need for their activities in other Member States, so that they are able to use service providers familiar to them and need deal only with a simple standard set of rules; urges the Commission, in particular, to define a legal basis, to secure consumer protection at a high level, and to define the required components of harmonisation and an appropriate supervisory regime; 26. Believes that the pluralistic structure of the European banking market is an asset to the European economy and should not be called into question; Regulatory and supervisory system Market structure 27.
