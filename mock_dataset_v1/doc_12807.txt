Question for written answer E-000477/2012 to the Council Rule 117 Vilija Blinkevičiūtė (S&D) (24 January 2012) Subject: Ensuring the European Parliament's role in adopting and implementing the Treaty on stability, coordination and governance in the Economic and Monetary Union During its meeting on 9 December 2011, the European Council adopted measures to strengthen the Economic and Monetary Union and agreed to the drafting of a separate Treaty text based on the Treaty on European Union which would be applicable solely to the countries of the euro area. This Treaty on stability, coordination and governance in the Economic and Monetary Union has now been drafted and was subject last month to intensive negotiations. Does the Council consider that the European Parliament was sufficiently involved in those negotiations, and will its position be adequately reflected in the final text of this Treaty? How is the Council going to ensure that the European Parliament’s powers and role are duly put into effect in future when decisions are adopted on governance in the Economic and Monetary Union?
