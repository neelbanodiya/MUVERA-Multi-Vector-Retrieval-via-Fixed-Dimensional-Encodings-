Notes that 2006 is the last year of the 2000 - 2006 Financial Perspective and the last year of several long-term programmes which should be implemented quickly but which should also indirectly contribute to the formulation of the new political guidelines for the 2007 - 2013 Financial Perspective; 2. Believes that in spite of current difficulties in the budgetary procedure for 2006, it is important to maintain the EU's responsibility for a more social and competitive Europe, and regrets the Commission's lack of ambition in this regard; 3. Observes with regret that the practice of gender budgeting has still not been implemented; notes that, in accordance with the principles set out in the Amsterdam Treaty, its Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has examined a range of Community policies and measures from the point of view of equal opportunities and the protection of women's rights;
