Question for written answer E-010934/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Sergio Paolo Frances Silvestris (PPE) (24 November 2011) Subject: Assistance for women leaving their jobs for maternity reasons Although unemployment figures for women in Puglia have improved over the last six months, down from 30.99 % to 28.42 %, the number of women leaving their jobs for maternity reasons is steadily increasing, as shown by a recent study on employment levels among women in Puglia drawn up for the regional labour department. According to the report, there has been a 27.3 % increase in the number of women leaving their jobs for maternity reasons, this generally occurring, according to the relevant statistics, when the infant is nine months old. In view of this: 1. Is the Commission aware of the report drawn up by the Puglia Regional Employment Department? 2. Does it intend to formulate policies designed to help women remain in employment following maternity? 3. Does it intend to ensure the provision of psychological, educational and social support to encourage women to remain in employment? 4. Is funding being specifically earmarked for awareness campaigns and, if not, will this be envisaged in future?
