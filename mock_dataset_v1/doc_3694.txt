Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (13 July 2006) The Commission has noted the results of the European RANCH project, which provides evidence of the effects of chronic exposure to aircraft noise on children's ability to learn to read. The project increases knowledge of the effects of exposure to environmental noise on health, which was the subject of Directive 2002/49/EC, adopted on 25 June 2002 Directive 2002/49/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise, OJ L 189, 18.7.2002. . The Commission will duly consider the project in its report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the implementation of the directive. The report, to be submitted before 18 July 2009, will assess whether it is necessary to develop new Community strategies and measures. Continued research into health impacts of environmental stressors such as noise is planned to be funded under the seventh research framework programme (‘Cooperation’ specific programme, theme ‘Environment’, key action ‘Environment and health’).
