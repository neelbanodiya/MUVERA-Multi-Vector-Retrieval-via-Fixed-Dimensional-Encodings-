Question for written answer E-001598/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Franz Obermayr (NI) (18 February 2011) Subject: Patent protection — India Patent protection is one of the most important intellectual property rights: it fosters innovations and inventions and enables individual intellectual property owners to enforce their legal claims. That was not the view taken in India in the latest ruling to have been handed down by the Indian Patent Court, which in the case involving Enercon India Ltd (EIL) decided that the national interest should be deemed to take precedence over one company’s rights to its technology. EIL, which manufactures wind energy converters, was set up as a joint venture between a German company, Enercon GmbH, and an Indian textile entrepreneur. After serious disagreements between the partners the Indian entrepreneur sued the German company to make it disclose its patents. The petition was granted, and EIL has obtained a compulsory licence to use the Enercon patented inventions. Bearing in mind that this situation raises thorny problems: 1. Is the Commission aware of the Indian patent court ruling? If so, has there been a response from the EU? Does the Commission know of any similar cases? If so, what procedure was followed, or how will such cases be dealt with in future? 2. In which respects does the Commission consider international patent law to be so severely flawed that it might harm European companies operating worldwide or put them at a competitive disadvantage? 3. What kind of cooperation is the EU pursuing with the WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organisation)? 4. What is the Commission’s general attitude to the opposition between, on the one hand, the right to intellectual property and, on the other, the ‘general interest’ of states and compulsory licences? What sorts of conflicts could arise from differences in the patent philosophies of industrialised countries, emerging countries (such as India), and developing countries?
