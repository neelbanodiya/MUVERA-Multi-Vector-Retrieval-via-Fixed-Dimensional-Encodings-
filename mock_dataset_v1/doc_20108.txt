Mr Olivier Dupuis. ANNEX Article 68 of the Italian Constitution Members of Parliament may not be prosecuted for opinions expressed and votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. Without the autorization of the Chamber to which he belongs no Member of Parliament may be subjected to criminal proceedings; he may not be arrested or otherwise deprived of this personal liberty or subjected to a search of this person or house unless he is caught in the act of committing a crime for which a warrant and arrest order are compulsory. The same authorization shall be required for the arrest or detention of a Member of Parliament in the execution of a sentence, even if it is irrevocable.
