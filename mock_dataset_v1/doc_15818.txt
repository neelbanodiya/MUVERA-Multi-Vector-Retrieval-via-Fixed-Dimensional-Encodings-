Answer given by Mr Dimas on behalf of the Commission (2 April 2009) In response to the question raised by the Honourable Member in relation to the decision taken by the Icelandic Government to resume commercial whaling the Commission would like to make the following observations in addition to the replies already given to the questions E‑4799/06 and E‑4879/06 and E0627/07 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/application/home.do?language=EN : The Commission remains deeply concerned by the Icelandic whale hunt taking place under reservation to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) moratorium. As explained in the replies to the above questions by the Honourable Member the Commission has indeed expressed its concerns about such whaling activities on various occasions as they undermine international efforts to conserve and protect whales effectively. With respect to the ongoing discussions on the future of the IWC, the Commission is fully committed to ensuring that any future agreement will guarantee a significant improvement in the conservation status of whales in the long term and bring all whaling operations under IWC control. In the context of these discussions the Commission and EU Member States will also exchange views with Iceland and the Commission hopes that the EU, together with other IWC members, will be able to find a solution to the issue of Icelandic whaling.
