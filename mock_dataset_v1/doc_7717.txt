Question for written answer E-010930/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 João Ferreira (GUE/NGL) (6 January 2011) Subject: Illegal exploitation of mineral resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo The subsoil of the Democratic Republic of Congo holds some of the world's most important mineral reserves, among them cobalt, copper, gold and diamonds. The struggle over the control and exploitation of those reserves is not unrelated to the conflicts which have devastated that country and Central Africa in general, or to the succession of atrocities, human rights violations and crimes against humanity which have occurred in the region. The illegal exploitation of mineral resources feeds these conflicts, with their appalling humanitarian consequences, and is a form of exploitation of the Congolese people, depriving it of resources that are vital to its affirmation of a genuine, autonomous and sovereign national development project. The UN has dedicated a degree of attention to the matter: the report of a UN expert group from 2002 claimed that European companies could be involved in arms trafficking linked to the illegal exploitation of mineral resources. Can the Commission provide details of the actions undertaken by the EI with a view to ending the exploitation of these resources? What initiatives have been undertaken to date in terms of monitoring the origins of the raw materials used by EU companies, with a view to ensuring that they have not come from conflict zones, were not acquired from armed groups, and have not been produced by child labour?
