WRITTEN QUESTION E-0685/05 by Christine De Veyrac (PPE-DE) to the Council (1 March 2005) Subject: European Youth Pact The European Union is currently giving careful thought to its future. Among other things, discussions are in progress on how to revitalise the ‘Lisbon Strategy’ and thereby give our continent every chance of becoming ‘the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world’ in the future. That objective cannot be achieved without the full cooperation and involvement of young people. Young people have to be fully involved in the projects in hand, owing to their dynamism, energy and creative force. In this respect, one can only welcome the initiative launched in October 2004 by the four Heads of State and of Government of Germany, Spain, France and Sweden who proposed to the President-in-Office of the European Council that a new ‘European Youth Pact’ be drawn up. This Pact will hinge on three priority objectives: social and professional integration, support for European demographics (not least by enhancing the compatibility of family life and working life) and strengthening the coherence of EU measures aimed at the young. Can the Council state what action it intends to take on this initiative, which was brought forward four months ago?
