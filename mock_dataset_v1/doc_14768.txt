Answer given by Mrs Fischer Boel on behalf of the Commission (18 December 2009) As stated in its reply to the Written Question P‑5303/09 by Mr Czesław Siekierski http://www.europarl.europa.eu/QP-WEB/home.jsp , the Commission receives a high number of applications for entry into the register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications. Due to additional resources and streamlining of procedures, the initial scrutiny can now be completed within 12 months. However, only few applications are found to be complete and the Commission has followed the practice of requesting more information, which adds to the time taken to finalise a dossier. The Commission is mindful of the delays and to a large extent supports the sentiments of the Honourable Member. For this reason, the Commission will consider the best possible ways to shorten processes and reach the final decision more quickly in the case of incomplete dossiers by streamlining administrative procedures as set out in the Agricultural Product Quality Policy Communication (COM(234)2009).
