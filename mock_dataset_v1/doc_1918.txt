WRITTEN QUESTION E-0658/05 by Herbert Bösch (PSE) to the Commission (1 March 2005) Subject: Recognition of qualifications Cross-border mobility is steadily increasing as far as education and training are concerned. Unfortunately, however, in many areas training acquired in another EU country is still not recognised in a number of Member States. This makes it more difficult, or impossible, to practise certain occupations in a number of countries within the European Union. The EC Treaty, which lays down provisions on the free movement of workers, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services, as well as general recognition of school education or vocational training, is in many cases not observed. Under the system for the recognition of qualifications (diplomas, certificates, etc), the host Member State cannot refuse Community citizens access to a regulated profession if they are qualified to practise that profession in their country of origin. However, harmonisation and recognition of qualifications awarded by Member States is not guaranteed. 1. What measures does the Commission plan to take in order to achieve recognition of training within the EU? 2. In this connection, does the Commission envisage a minimum requirement for training, which must be recognised in all EU Member States?
