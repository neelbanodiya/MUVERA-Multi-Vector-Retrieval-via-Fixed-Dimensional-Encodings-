WRITTEN QUESTION E-5683/06 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Council (4 January 2007) Subject: F-type prisons A Turkish lawyer, Behic Asci, has now been on hunger strike for 200 days in protest at the conditions in which his clients are held in detention in F-type prisons, i.e. in total isolation. Since 2000, a campaign has been waged in Turkey to have this type of prison abolished. If Mr Asci continues his hunger strike, doctors estimate that he will die within approximately one month. Mr Asci's only request is simply that the Turkish Government should undertake to look into the matter. What are the Council's views on this matter? Is this situation consistent with the European acquis ? Does it intend to do anything before Mr Asci dies?
