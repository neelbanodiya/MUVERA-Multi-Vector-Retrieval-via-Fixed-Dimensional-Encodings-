Joint answer given by Mr Kallas on behalf of the Commission Written questions : E-005010/11 , E-005045/11 (7 July 2011) The Commission is committed to raising drivers' awareness of the need to reduce any sort of distraction while driving: drivers must pay constant attention to the surrounding traffic for their own safety, the safety of passengers and of other road users. To this end the Commission considers that a valuable contribution comes from driving education. In particular, the positive impact of first training to road traffic could be enhanced by applying new approaches, for instance the ‘coaching’ which adapt the training modules to the individual characteristics and risk tendencies of the trainee, such as talking on the phone or texting while driving. The Commission funded two studies, one on ‘Car telephone use and road safety’ and the other on the ‘Regulatory situation in the Member States regarding brought-in (i.e. nomadic) devices and their use in vehicles’ in 2009/2010. The first study indicates the adverse consequences associated with the use of a car telephone while driving (either talking or texting) while the second revealed that different Member States assess the road safety risk of using mobile devices whilst driving rather differently and that no common EU view and/or legislation exists yet. The Commission is currently considering the revision of the European Statement of Principles on Human Machine Interface for in–vehicle information and communication systems to promote their safe installation and use within the vehicle environment. The Commission does not issue any statistic on road traffic accidents due to texting since the data on road accidents are based on the reports issued by the national police authorities which do not include this information.
