Question for Question Time H-000051/2011 to the Commission Part-session: February 2011 Rule 116 Charalampos Angourakis (GUE/NGL) Subject: Prosecutions of officials of the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain Prosecutions have recently been brought, in Spain, against three members and officials of the Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain (PCPE) for ‘incitement to civil disorder’ during a demonstration in Barcelona in 2007. The officials concerned claim that the accusations against them are based on a plot fabricated by the police and maintain that only two of their number were in fact anywhere near where the police charges took place, the third official not having even taken part in the demonstration. The PCPE believes that these prosecutions stem from the will of the Spanish middle classes, the national government and the local authorities to incriminate and stifle Communist opponents on the basis of charges trumped up by the police. Will the Commission condemn this legal action taken against three Communist officials and this attack on fundamental freedoms such as the right to freely participate in a demonstration and to express one’s disagreement?
