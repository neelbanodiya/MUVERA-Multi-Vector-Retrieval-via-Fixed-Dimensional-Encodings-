The House welcomes the budgetary efforts undertaken by the Commission and the Member States; however Parliament is disappointed with the fact Europe is not playing a major political role which corresponds to this financial support. With regard to aid, the House wants the Commission and the wider donor community to continue to co-operate with the Afghan Government to promote rapid progress in the areas of health and education, to implement assistance in all fields in order to achieve rapidly tangible progress and in order to make sure that assistance does not benefit regional leaders rather than the population in need. The House calls on the Member States to actively contribute to the training of a national Afghan army and police force and to the rebuilding of the judicial system and of a legal framework for effective human rights protection and for the improvement of women's conditions and calls in particular on the Commission to extend its cooperation to the Afghan Human Rights Commission. Parliament also calls on the US to clarify the situation of the prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and take the necessary steps to ensure that basic safeguards are in place for all those in its custody; while recognising the US Government's obligations to take effective security measures when dealing with cases affecting the safety of the public. With regard to women's rights, MEPs call on the UN Commission on Human Rights special reporter on violence against women and on the special reporter on human rights in Afghanistan to visit areas of Afghanistan where women and girls are being subjected to human rights abuses. The House also calls for a well-co-ordinated programme of mine action, including assistance to mine victims, to be put in place as a matter of urgency. MEPs also request all sides to fulfil the remaining provisions of the Bonn Agreement and for the drafting of a new constitution and preparations for free and fair elections by June 2004. Parliament is also concerned about the lingering problem of warlords operating in the country and believes that joint efforts by Afghan security forces and the international military forces should be increased
