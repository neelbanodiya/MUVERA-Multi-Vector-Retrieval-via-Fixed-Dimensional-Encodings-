has been regular and the operation of the plant trouble-free. In any event the duration of the running-in period should not exceed six weeks. The daily degradation values are calculated to the nearest 0,1% but the final result is given to the nearest whole number. In some cases it may be permissible to reduce the frequency of sampling but at least fourteen results collected over the twenty-one days which follow the running-in period should be used in calculating the average. 2. Determination of anionic surfactants in biodegradability tests 2.1. Principle The method is based on the fact that the cationic dye methylene blue forms blue salts with anionic surfactants (MBAS), which can be extracted with chloroform. To eliminate interference, the extraction is first effected from alkaline solution and the extract is then shaken with acidic methylene blue solution. The absorbency of the separated organic phase is measured photometrically at the wavelength of maximum absorption of 650 nm. 2.2. Reagents and equipment 2.2.1. Buffer solution pH 10 Dissolve 24 g sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO 3 AR, and 27 g anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na 2 CO 3 ) AR in deionised water and dilute to 1 000 ml. 2.2.2. Neutral methylene blue solution Dissolve 0,35 g methylene blue AR in deionised water and dilute to 1 000 ml. Prepare the solution at least twenty-four hours before use. The absorbency of the blank chloroform phase, measured against chloroform must not exceed 0,015 per 1 cm of layer thickness at 650 nm. 2.2.3. Acidic methylene blue solution Dissolve 0,35 g methylene blue AR in 500 ml deionised water and mix with 6,5 ml H 2 SO 4 (d = 1,84 g/ml). Dilute to 1 000 ml with deionised water. Prepare the solution at least twenty-four hours before use. The absorbency of the blank chloroform phase, measured against chloroform must not exceed 0,015 per 1 cm of layer thickness at 650 nm. 2.2.4. Chloroform (trichloromethane) AR freshly distilled 2.2.5. Dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid methyl ester 2.2.6. Ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution, KOH 0,1 M 2.2.7. Ethanol pure, C 2 H 5 OH 2.2.8. sulphuric acid, H 2 SO 4 0,5 M 2.2.9. Phenolphthalein solution Dissolve 1 g phenolphthalein in 50 ml ethanol and add 50 ml deionised water while stirring continuously. Filter off any precipitate obtained. 2.2.10. Methanolic hydrochloric acid: 250 ml hydrochloric acid AR and 750 ml methanol 2.2.11. Separating funnel, 250 ml 2.2.12. Graduated flask,
