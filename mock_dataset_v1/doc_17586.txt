The commitment credits total €253.150m, which is €1.613m and less than 1% more than a year before. The total appropriations for environmental programmes will slightly increase, following the increases in 'Forest Focus', the NGO programme and the marine pollution programme. No major changes are proposed for the last year of the LIFE programme and for the civil protection programme. The Commission proposes a decrease of €3.0m for the implementation of environment policy ('Awareness-raising and other general actions based on the Community action programmes in the field of environment'). The amount is partly recovered by an increase proposed for the development of new policy initiatives (+€1.1m). The shift reflects the priorities set out by the Commission in the Annual Policy Strategy. Expenditure on public health is divided between the current Public Health Programme (total € 59.2m), the Community tobacco fund (€14.6m), the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (see below), the preparatory action regarding public health preparedness and response and (€2.0m) and the Community contribution to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC; €0.2m). FCTC is the first treaty under the auspices of WHO and the European Community is due to ratify it this year. The appropriations for the Public Health Programme cover the operational expenditure, (€51.5m), the administrative and support expenditure (€1.9m) and the running of the Executive Agency (€5.8m), responsible for the practical implementation of the programme. The appropriations remain at the same level as in 2005. The preparatory action regarding public health preparedness and crisis management will be established through the development of health emergency infrastructure. It is designed to contribute also to a new strand of the health programme, which foresees to improve preparedness and rapid intervention capacity. The resources available will be used to encourage the development of cooperation between Member States in drawing up, implementing, testing and evaluating interoperability of public health emergency plans for both unexpected health threats (e.g. SARS) and expected contingencies (e.g. pandemic influenza).
