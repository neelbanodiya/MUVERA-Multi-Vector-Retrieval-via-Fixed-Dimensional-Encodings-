WRITTEN QUESTION E-0076/10 by David Casa (PPE) to the Commission (2 February 2010) Subject: Tree planting Trees are major assets, whether they be in the countryside, or more importantly in our cities. Just as streets, pavements, public buildings and recreational facilities form an important part of a community's infrastructure, so do publicly owned trees. Yet they are often overlooked. These assets require care and maintenance, just as much as other public property, if not more in certain circumstances. Trees improve our environment and quality of life. Apart from the obvious aesthetic benefits, trees that are planted within our urban areas improve our air, protect our water, save energy, and improve economic sustainability. Whilst all these benefits are well understood, certain countries have not reached the desired levels in this respect. What does the Commmission think of the concept of giving more financial assistance to construct or redevelop natural parks in Member States such as Malta, which have amongst the fewest natural parks per capita in the European Union?
