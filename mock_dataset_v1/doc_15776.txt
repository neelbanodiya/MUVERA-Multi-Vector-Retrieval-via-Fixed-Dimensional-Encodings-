Answer given by Mrs Reding on behalf of the Commission (22 July 2010) The Commission is aware of the difficulties some European citizens are facing in Spain in relation to the acquisition of real estate and the exercise of their property rights. The Parliament has investigated the issue Parliament Resolution P6_TA(2009)0192 , of 26.3.2009, based on the ‘Auken’ report. and the Commission has already responded to the question of applicable EU law. It should be noted that as regards fundamental rights, under the Treaty establishing the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission has no general powers to intervene in individual cases. It can do so only if the matter concerns the implementation of Union law. On the basis of the information provided by the Honourable Member, such a connection with Union law has not been identified at this stage. As regards the fight against corruption and the possible breach of the rule of law, the Commission has no competence to intervene in individual corruption cases or in the day-to-day functioning of the justice system of the Member States. The Treaty on European Union provides that Member States themselves are responsible for the maintenance of law and order in their country. The Commission, in line with the Stockholm Programme, is looking into the possibility to establish a mechanism allowing it to assess the progress made by the Member States in the fight against corruption.
