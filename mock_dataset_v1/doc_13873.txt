WRITTEN QUESTION E-3463/04 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) and Umberto Guidoni (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (20 December 2004) Subject: The Thyssen-Krupp crisis in Terni The management of the Thyssen-Krupp group did not make an appearance last November at the meeting arranged with representatives of the Italian government and the trade unions. The meeting was to be the starting point for discussions on maintaining production in the ‘special steels’ sector in Terni, but Thyssen-Krupp's non-participation suggests that the group has already taken decisions far removed from those initially hoped for. 1. Is the Commission acquainted with the Thyssen-Krupp group's intentions to relocate the manufacture of some of the Terni plants’ products, for example, magnetic steel? 2. What steps does the Commission intend to take to prevent the plants having to shut down, which would cause a crisis in such a vital sector as steel for the province of Terni? 3. Does the Commission know about the commitments made by Thyssen-Krupp in early 2004 to safeguard the steel sector at the Terni plants?
