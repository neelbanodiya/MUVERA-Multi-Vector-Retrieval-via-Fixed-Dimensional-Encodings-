Answer given by High Representative/Vice‑President Ashton on behalf of the Commission (19 August 2011) Since the beginning of her tenure, the High Representative/Vice‑President (HR/VP) has ensured that conflict prevention is at the centre of the EU's external action. This is based on the consideration that, rather than to focus on managing the consequences of conflicts, it is preferable to prevent conflicts from escalating into violence in the first place. Conflict prevention therefore is a priority for the European External Action Service (EEAS) and will be mainstreamed into all its activities. Focus will be put on practical and action-oriented work addressing potential and ongoing crises and conflict situations. To mark the thenth anniversary of the EU Programme for the Prevention of Violent Conflict (Gothenburg Programme), the Council conclusions on conflict prevention of 20 June 2011 reaffirmed that preventing conflicts and relapses into conflict is a primary objective of the EU’s external action. The Council noted that the Lisbon Treaty and the creation of the European External Action Service, with its integrated resources, provide the opportunity to give new impetus to preventive action by the EU. In this regard, the Council considered in particular that: — early warning needs to be further strengthened within the EU, better integrating capacities and outputs from all sources, including from Member States, and drawing more extensively upon field based information from EU Delegations and civil society actors; — more emphasis needs to be put on taking early action aimed at mitigating the risks of outbreak and recurrence of conflicts, including through the effective utilization of conflict risk analysis; — there is scope for the EU and its Member States to strengthen their capacity to design realistic options for preventive action, including through EU mediation and EU support provided to conflict prevention and resolution activities of international, national or local governmental and non-governmental partners; — partnerships with key partners such as the United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), World Bank, African Union and other international actors and individual countries such as the US need to be further strengthened. The HR/VP is committed to implementing these Council conclusions which set out concrete avenues for focused joint efforts to further strengthen EU engagement in the field of conflict prevention. The cooperation with, and contribution by, the Hungarian Presidency to this work was specifically recognised by the Council conclusions
