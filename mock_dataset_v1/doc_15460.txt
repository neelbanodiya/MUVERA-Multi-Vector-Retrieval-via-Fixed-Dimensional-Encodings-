Reply (20 September 2010) As stated by the Honorable Member, the Council reached political agreement 9948/10 + COR 1. on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the application of patients rights in cross-border healthcare 11307/08. at its meeting on 8 June 2010. The text is currently undergoing legal-linguistic revision and the Council's position at first reading will be submitted for formal adoption by the Council at the beginning of September 2010 under Article 294(5) TFEU. The Council´s position and the statement of the Council's reasons will thereafter be transmitted, under Article 294(6) TFEU, to the European Parliament for the second reading. This proposal is one of the priorities of the Belgian Presidency. The Council believes that a mutually acceptable agreement could be found between the Council and the European Parliament at the second reading, in order to adopt the directive as soon as possible. According to the current draft, the Member States would then have three years to transpose the provisions of the directive into their national legislation.
