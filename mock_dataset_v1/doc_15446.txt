Question for written answer E-004649/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Petru Constantin Luhan (PPE) (16 May 2011) Subject: Evaluation and statistics relating to Directive 2006/24/EC On 18 April 2011 the Commission adopted an evaluation report on the Data Retention Directive (Directive 2006/24/EC) presenting the lessons learned since the directive was adopted in 2006. The directive laid down that data should be retained in response to urgent security challenges following the terrorist attacks in Madrid in 2004 and London in 2005. The report concludes that the retention of telecommunications data plays an important role in protecting the population against the risks arising from serious crimes. These data provide evidence that is essential in order to solve crimes and administer justice. Cecilia Malmström, the Commissioner for Home Affairs, has said that ‘retained data was for example crucial to the success of Operation Rescue which helped reveal the identities of 670 suspected members of an international paedophile network and protect children from abuse in Member States where the directive has been transposed’. The report also states that ‘the directive does not in itself guarantee that retained data are being stored, retrieved and used in full compliance with the right to privacy and protection of personal data’, and this has led courts to annul the legislation transposing the directive in some Member States. In the light of the Protocol on the application of the proportionality principle, what is the ratio between the number of offences that have been prevented through the interception of electronic communications and the total number of cases where such data has been intercepted and stored? If such statistics exist, will they be made available to the public?
