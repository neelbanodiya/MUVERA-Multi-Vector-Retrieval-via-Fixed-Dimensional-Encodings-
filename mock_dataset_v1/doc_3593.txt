value added tax on services provided in the postal sector ( COM(2003) 234 – C5-0227/2003 – 2003/0091(CNS)) Doc.: A5-0122/2004 Procedure : Consultation Debate : 10.03.2004 Vote: 11.03.2004 Vote The plenary of the European Parliament adopted today under the consultation procedure a draft resolution by which they support the Commission's proposal to abolish the VAT exemption for public postal services. An amendment forwarded by the Socialist Group to reject the entire proposal was defeated with 180 votes in favour, 240 against and 12 abstentions. The Parliament voted the second report by Olle SCHMIDT (ELDR, S). The proposal will now go for the final decision to the Council, which will have to take its decision by unanimity. Postal services were exempted from VAT under the Sixth VAT Directive dating from the 1970s. The aim of the Commission proposal is to amend the directive by making postal services subject to VAT, although the new directive would allow reduced VAT rates for standard postal services, including the majority of private mail and also some business mail. The Parliament resolution modifies the Commission proposal by proposing to allow the Member States to apply reduced tax rates on postal services in order to avoid or limit the price increases to the minimum. MEPs also suggest allowing Member States which on 1 January 2003 applied a super reduced rate to goods and services to continue to apply this super reduced rate. The report also proposes to raise the weight limit for the reduced rate for standard mail from 2 kg to 10 kg. In order to comply with the VAT Directive, the Member States are asked to bring their laws, regulations and administrative provisions into force by 1 January 2007. The adoption of the resolution by the plenary followed the rejection of the Commission proposal at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 24 February 2004 by 16 votes to 12 with 2 abstentions.
