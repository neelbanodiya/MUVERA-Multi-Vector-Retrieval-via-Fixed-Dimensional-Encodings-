equality and social inclusion attention must be given to all areas of life; believes that the communication should stress the need to consolidate the results obtained so as to lay firm foundations for future work; Regrets that the Commission communication does not include an integrated gender perspective nor a separate chapter on gender specific disability policies; calls on the Commission to integrate the gender perspective and specific information on women with disabilities in the successive phases of its action plan; calls respectively on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to introduce gender mainstreaming into all disability policies; 3. Regrets the absence of legislative proposals in the Action Plan - in particular a directive to combat discrimination based on disabilities, extending to all sectors of European Union competence and designed once and for all to remove all barriers to participation in community life by people with disabilities and to allow them genuinely to enjoy full citizenship - despite the repeated calls made by the European Parliament on this matter and the debate launched by the Italian Presidency of the European Union concerning an anti-discrimination directive; recalls the Commission's commitment to such a directive; 4. Regrets that no attention has been given in the Action Plan proposals for the need to give particular support to organisations of disabled persons in enlargement countries to assist them in the transition process of accession; 5. Calls on the Commission to include in its forthcoming Green Paper on future strategy on non-discrimination, and in its new social policy agenda, a timetable for the submission of a directive to combat discrimination based on disabilities in those areas not covered by Directive 2000/78/EC; calls on the EU and the Member States to develop statistics on the situation of disabled people, broken down by gender. A study should be undertaken if any legislation in the Member States concerning disabled people discriminates against disabled women and girls; 6. Calls on Member States which have not yet done so to transpose Directive 2000/78/EC fully as soon as possible, to inform those to whom it is addressed and to develop training measures for those responsible for its implementation, including judges; welcomes the intention expressed by the Commission to penalise failure to transpose the Directive into national law; 7. Considers that the future treaty establishing a constitution for Europe must provide for stronger measures to make it possible to combat discrimination
