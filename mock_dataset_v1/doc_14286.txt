enable a 'bottom-up' approach to be adopted, particularly in nanoelectronics; 12. Believes that actions to accelerate technology development must be complemented by policy measures to ensure the market penetration of existing technologies; notes that standards can provide a level playing field for markets and international trade and are prerequisites for fair competition, comparative risk assessments and regulatory measures; calls therefore on the Commission and the Council to remove any roadblocks in the form of lack of standards and unclear legislation, which unnecessarily hold back the adoption of nanotechnologies and nanosciences in Europe, and to do so without imposing any new bureaucratic hurdles; 13. Stresses the importance of generating the 'triangle of knowledge' needed for the European Research Area; considers that in order to achieve the necessary synergy between research, education and innovation, a comprehensive knowledge transfer approach, and also the development of cross-sector human resources, are needed; calls therefore on Member States to develop strategies to improve knowledge transfer and to address the skills shortage by increased emphasis on natural science training and by attracting more students into nanoscience and science-related, multidisciplinary subjects; welcomes the Commission’s effort to support Research Training Networks in nanotechnologies and calls on the Member States to create, both individually and in close cooperation with each other, multidisciplinary networks to combine nanotechnologies with a broad spectrum of research areas, with the aim of developing new hybrid technologies; 14.Considers that industry, research institutes and financial institutions should work together to ensure that excellent R&D in nanosciences and nanotechnologies is translated into new products and processes; points out that Member States should accelerate and stimulate this process by focussing on improving the business climate for companies in the nanotechnology sector in their country, especially 'start ups', SMEs and innovative companies; considers, in this respect, that the protection of intellectual property rights is essential for innovation, both in terms of attracting initial investment and for ensuring future revenue; calls on the Commission to develop standards for the protection of intellectual property rights and models for licensing agreements; 15 Regrets the fact that patenting of nanoscience and nanotechnology inventions in Europe is developing slowly; calls on the EU to create a nanoscience and nanotechnology patent monitoring system governed by the European Patent Office; 16. Encourages general reforms in the field of the European patent system in order to cut the costs of patenting and to improve the accessibility of patents
