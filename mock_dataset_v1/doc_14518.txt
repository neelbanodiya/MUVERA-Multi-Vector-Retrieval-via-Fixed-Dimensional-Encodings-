Question for written answer E-010489/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Giancarlo Scottà (EFD) (15 December 2010) Subject: EU‑Morocco trade agreements In February 2006, the first trade negotiations opened between the European Union and Morocco. An agreement is currently under consideration that would provide for immediate liberalisation for agricultural products and fruit and vegetables and gradual liberalisation (over the next 10 years) for processed agricultural and fisheries products. This has met with a negative reaction across Europe and from farmers’ representatives. Spain and Italy in particular have called for the new agreement not to be signed because they consider it would damage European agricultural production, employment in farming and agricultural trading and the competitiveness of European enterprises. Does the Commission consider that these agreements would foster cooperation between the two parties to the agreement, boost their markets and enhance trade in agricultural and fisheries products? Has it considered the potential consequences of this liberalisation of the market? What will the upshot be for farmers, SMEs and European consumers? What other trade negotiations on economic liberalisation agreements with other third countries is the Commission currently engaged in? What will the repercussions of those agreements be in the context of Morocco’s violation of rights in the Western Sahara (Morocco is not recognised as having sovereignty over that territory): see the statement by the Iberian farmers’ association COAG, according to which the trade liberalisation agreement could be illegal if it covers the Western Sahara?
