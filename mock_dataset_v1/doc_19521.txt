ORAL QUESTION H-0348/06 for Question Time at the part-session in May 2006 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Paulo Casaca to the Council Subject: Expulsion of European families from Canada People in Portugal have followed with great concern the recent series of pictures of emigrant families arriving in Portugal after being repatriated from Canada, in many instances including children born in Canada, who do not know Portugal and have no knowledge of Portuguese, following many years' residence in Canada and generally with only two weeks' notice. In its answer to my parliamentary question ( E-2208/00 ) on European emigration to the USA and Canada, the Commission informed me that 'the possible negative consequences of the Illegal Immigration Reform And Immigration Responsibility Act (IIRAIRA) on Union citizens have been discussed with the Member States at the Consular Affairs working group of the Council and have been raised with the United States government'. Will the Council state whether it has taken, or currently intends to take, similar measures to try to draw the attention of the Canadian authorities to the dramatic situation being faced by these European emigrant families in Canada? 1 OJ C 89 E, 20.3.2001, p. 162.
