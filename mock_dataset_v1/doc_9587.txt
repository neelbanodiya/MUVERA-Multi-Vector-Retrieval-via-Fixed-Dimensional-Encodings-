Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (18 October 2007) The Commission has set forth its human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) policy in the Commission communication on combating HIV/AIDS within the European Union and in the neighbouring countries 2006‑09 COM(2005)654 final. . The communication highlights the need for targeted prevention to vulnerable and other at risk populations, including youth. The Commission promotes implementation of comprehensive prevention programmes through exchange of best practises, sharing of prevention material and promotion of evidence based prevention. However, it is the responsibility of individual Member States to plan and implement their specific prevention activities, and to choose the most efficient means of presentation according to the particular setting. It is not in the remits of the Commission to prescribe how those activities are designed and/or implemented.
