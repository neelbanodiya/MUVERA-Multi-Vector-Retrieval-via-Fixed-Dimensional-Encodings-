continues at the level of 2005, i.e. about EUR 200 million. 2. The Commission proposes to mobilise the flexibility instrument for an amount of EUR 123, 5 million for the post-tsunami actions (negative margin of 123, 5 million in the PDB).and, in this way, it recognises (partially) that these activities cannot be financed within the ceiling without a negative effect on other programmes. 3. This effort is not enough. In order to fit in the new priorities, the Commission's PDB is marked by a restrictive approach on the existing (traditional) priorities. For Asia, the Commission has also proceeded to some re-allocation of funds within the existing envelope to be able to direct more funding towards the Tsunami reconstruction. Since the total amount for the Tsunami is EUR 180 million and the proposed flexibility is EUR 123, 5 million, the difference, EUR 56, 5 million, has presumably been found through redeployment. 4. Overall, heading 4 commitment appropriations increase by 4.7% compared to the 2005 budget but, if the Preliminary Draft Amending Budget 3/2005 is taken into account (supplementary EUR 170 million proposed for Tsumani in 2005, out of which EUR 98 million in flexibility, EUR 12 million from rapid reaction mechanism and EUR 60 million in internal cuts of other actions), the increase is much smaller at +1, 4 %. 5. The rapporteur intends to present a separate working document also for heading 4 in the course of the procedure. 6. In total, payment appropriations decrease by -2.2 % ( -119 million) under heading 4. The rapporteur considers hat this must be examined in greater detail since the process of reform and devolution in the external field should normally imply better possibilities to step up implementation. heading 4: Comparison with 2005 Budget APPROPRIATIONS FOR COMMITMENTS Budget Financial perspective Preliminary draft budget Difference Difference 2005 Amending budget 1 and preliminary draft amending budgets 2 (salary adjustments) and 3 (tsunami financing) included. 2006 2006 2005 / 2006 2005 / 2006 (1) (2) (3) (3 / 1) (3 – 1) Euros Euros Euros % Euros 4.
