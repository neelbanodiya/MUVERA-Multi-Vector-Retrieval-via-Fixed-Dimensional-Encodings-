Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (28 June 2007) Peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland are the result of a political process and the will of the people of Northern Ireland; these have been the keys to its success. The Commission is strongly committed to the process of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, and believes firmly that the support which it has provided since 1989 through the International Fund for Ireland (IFI) and since 1995 through the Peace Programmes has made a valuable contribution to the process. Through its support for economic and social development in mainstream cohesion policy programmes (which will total EUR 2.6 billion for the period 1995-2013), the Union has also contributed to stability in Northern Ireland. Since 1989 the European Union has committed EUR 298 million to the IFI, contributing to the support of nearly 6 000 projects. In December 2006, the Council adopted a Commission proposal Council Regulation (EC) No 1968/2006 of 21 December 2006 concerning Community financial contributions to the International Fund for Ireland (2007-2010), OJ L 409, 30.12.2006. for a new regulation to continue the European Union contributions to the Fund. This contribution will be EUR 15 million per annum until 2010, the final year of operations of the Fund. As such, European Union funding now represents over 50 % of the annual contributions to the Fund. Since 1995, the Peace I (1994-1999) and Peace II (2000‑2006) programmes have received over EUR 1 billion of European Union funds. By the end of 2006 some 6 500 projects had benefited from this financing. The mid‑term evaluation of the current PEACE II Programme and the study ‘The European Union Programme for Peace and Reconciliation — The Impact’ have confirmed that the PEACE Programme has contributed to the increased engagement of the two main communities in Northern Ireland and the Border Region in building peace and reconciliation. PEACE III, for the period 2007‑2013 will have a budget of EUR 225 million. Beyond the financial aspects of these investments funded by the EU, the design and implementation of these policies has been based on the partnership of the two communities in Northern Ireland. This has proved to be an effective way of diluting some of the tensions between the communities and across the border, of bringing people together to work on concrete issues, and of giving a wider European dimension to their
