in EU regions; 18. Calls for the various financial instruments brought to bear to take due account of the specific characteristics of regions, in particular those with special economic, geographical and demographic features in terms of remoteness, inherent difficulties as regards competitive markets or a lack of economies of scale; 19. Stresses that actions in this area are undertaken predominantly at local level, and endorses the Commission’s efforts to develop and improve mechanisms that will enable local actors to obtain relevant information to reduce investment costs; considers that, for broadband plans to become fully operational, not only must the Commission and the Member States cooperate, but regional and local authorities must also be involved in devising the plans; 20. Considers that the extension of broadband networks, primarily in rural areas, will facilitate better communications, particularly for persons with reduced mobility or living in isolated conditions, as well as improving access to services and encouraging the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas, thereby helping to create new jobs and develop new services in these localities; 21. Calls on the Member States to establish what measures can be taken to facilitate market penetration by new operators with a view to encouraging a competitive environment; 22. Welcomes the EU action plan for critical infrastructure protection in the field of information technology and calls for measures to improve online safety.
