Question for written answer E-007586/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) (29 July 2011) Subject: Humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa The UN has alerted attention to the drought in the Horn of Africa which is now threatening the lives of over 11 million people, giving rise to a severe food crisis and a rise in malnutrition indices. This, together with the armed conflicts, raises the likelihood of a humanitarian disaster of spectacular proportions. More than 500 people have already died in Somalia this year from drought-related illnesses, and there has also been a rise in the numbers of refugees and displaced persons abandoning their homes. In the last two weeks Kenya has received 20 000 Somalis, and the camp at Dadaab is overflowing to the point where new arrivals are either being turned away or are obliged to stay outside without proper access to water, healthcare or sanitation. Will the Commission consider making an additional special contribution to the UN's World Food Programme? What other special measures will the Commission put in place in response to the UN's appeal over the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa?
