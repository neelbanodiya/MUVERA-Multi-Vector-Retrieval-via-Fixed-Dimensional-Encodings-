WRITTEN QUESTION E-0422/06 by Dimitrios Papadimoulis (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (7 February 2006) Subject: Extension of the period for signing contracts and utilising funding under the CSF According to reports in the Greek press, the Greek Government is in negotiation with the Commission's departments in order to reach an agreement that some of the legal commitments associated with the CSF may also be signed later than 2006, with the further possibility of extending the take-up period for appropriations beyond 2008. If the above information is correct, will the Commission say what arguments the Greek Government has put forward to obtain an extension of the deadline? Is the Commission examining the matter? Does it intend to set any conditions? If so, what are they?
