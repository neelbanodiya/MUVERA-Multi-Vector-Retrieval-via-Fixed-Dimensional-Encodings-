we want to sell to the whole world. Q. What about jobs? Burhan from Belgium writes that "green employment is needed". However, Stane from Slovenia maintains: "It will be difficult to abolish old, dirty technologies. They employ far too many people". KHF: That is true indeed, but the economic and job-related crisis did not happen because we overdid environmental policies. This crisis happened because the bankers were incapable, because they did not manage other people's money properly. Now we may not blame environmental politics for that. However, there are indeed many jobs in, for example, cement and steel production. Therefore, our foremost task must be to care for education, innovation and a change of mind. We have to invest our money into the education of young people. They are our hope. Q. So you wouldn't agree with one reader who termed environmental policies and green efforts a "PR exercise"? KHF: No, that is wrong. And if it was, it would be horrible because we are running out of resources. If we do not start saving the environment sustainably our children will have no raw material with which to heat their homes or to produce goods.
