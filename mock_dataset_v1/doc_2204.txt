Answer given by Mr Hahn on behalf of the Commission (10 January 2012) The allocation of a performance reserve should be carried out at a point in time when Member States have already had sufficient time to implement programmes and to achieve results, but early enough in the period to enable the allocation and the timely disbursement of the reserve. The performance reserve forms 5 % of the overall financial allocation, which is sufficiently substantial to serve as an incentive, but small enough to be used by the end of 2022. The reserve can only be used for priorities where milestones set for 2018 have been fulfilled and which therefore have already shown good progress. Therefore, the risk that the reserve is allocated but not used in a timely manner due to implementation difficulties is low.
