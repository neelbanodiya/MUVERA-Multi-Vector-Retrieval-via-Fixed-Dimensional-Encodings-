Question for written answer E-001876/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Emilie Turunen (Verts/ALE) (3 March 2011) Subject: Use of procurement to promote green growth In its Europe 2020 strategy, the Commission floated the notion that Europe's future needs to be secured through smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. One way of realising that objective is to make use of the EU's procurement rules. In the Danish debate, there is often uncertainty as to which rules apply and what sort of demands can be made in the procurement rules. Consequently — because of legal uncertainty — local authorities, regions and national government are reticent about using procurement to realise political objectives. Accordingly, can the Commission say whether public authorities can make use of the EU's procurement rules to demand that: — green procurement account for at least 60 % of all public procurement (cf. proposal 11 in the Single Market Act); — the EU's procurement rules be interpreted less rigidly so as to ensure flexibility for public procurement authorities (cf. proposal 17 in the Single Market Act); — more active use be made of social clauses, e.g. in connection with education obligations; — innovative proposals be rewarded (cf. point 6 in the ‘Innovation Union’ executive summary); — design contests be modelled on precompetitive public procurement (cf. point 6 in the ‘Innovation Union’ executive summary); — there be greater focus on public-private cooperation so as to promote growth and innovation (cf. proposal 18 in the Single Market Act); — open standards be used for IT platforms? Can the Commission confirm that these proposals are in line with EU legislation? Can the Commission also confirm that the proposals are in keeping with the Commission's own proposals to use procurement to promote green growth, more jobs and social progress as put forward in the ‘Innovation Union’ initiative and the Single Market Act?
