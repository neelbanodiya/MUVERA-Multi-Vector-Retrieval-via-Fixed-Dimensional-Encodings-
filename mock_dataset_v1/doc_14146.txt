in some Member States, there is a need for increased transparency and for the disclosure of fees levied on asset management, especially on all layers of investment by private pension providers; further notes the intergenerational effects such fees may have, through the increased financial burden that may be placed on younger generations; 14. Recognises that there is no perfect pension system and that pension systems and economic circumstances differ across Member States, but is convinced that a balanced multi-pillar system of public, work-related and private, as well as funded and unfunded, schemes should be found; observes, however, that responsibility for devising a balanced multi-pillar system rests with the Member States; is of the opinion that each Member State should define a minimum target post-retirement income level so as to avoid increasing poverty among ageing populations; 15. Notes that the current terminology referring to the multi-pillar system does not correspond to the reality in various Member States; calls, therefore, on the Commission to make the necessary efforts to come up with a typology of pension systems in Member States, as well as a common set of definitions, in order to make systems comparable and thus substantially improve policy cooperation at European level; 16. Observes that there is a trend towards more defined-contribution schemes and fewer defined-benefit schemes; notes that, as a result, pension providers transfer the risk associated with investment to pension savers; stresses that pension savers must be informed in good time of the risk they are running; urges Member States to ensure a greater commitment from employers to contributing towards retired employees’ income security; 17. Observes that, despite the great variety of pension products in the various Member States, not every European citizen has access to a wide range of such products; considers that European citizens should be given maximum access to various ways of accumulating pension rights, and recognises the need to improve access to existing pension products; 18. Observes that encouraging citizens to start saving at a younger age can considerably reduce the individual’s pension gap, and welcomes the sharing of best practice across Member States with respect, for example, to pensions portals; 19. Notes that the divergent wage and social security levels in the Member States do not permit or justify an EU-wide harmonised minimum pension; 20. Notes the contribution that may be made by working longer and, at the same time, realises that workers generally
