WRITTEN QUESTION E-1142/08 by Ashley Mote (NI) to the Commission (5 March 2008) Subject: Utilities owned by foreign companies Does the Commission have any doubts about its making illegal Margaret Thatcher's ‘golden shares’ that protected public utilities in Britain from takeover by foreign commercial interests when they were privatised? Is the Commission aware of the massive commercial and servicing problems which have arisen recently over the Spanish ownership of the busiest international airport in the world at London Heathrow? Does the Commission appreciate that Heathrow is not only a vital airport for the UK, but that it is also one end of the busiest link across the Atlantic? Is the Commission aware of the following facts — the new owners Ferrovial have run out of money, the provision of crucial land and air-side services is failing to meet even minimum essential standards, and the sustainability resources of the present owners is in serious doubt? Did the Commission know that Ferrovial was one of the most heavily leveraged companies in Europe when it raised the 16 billion pounds sterling to buy BAA two years ago, against widespread opposition from many who saw the present scenario coming? Was the Commission aware that Ferrovial's refinancing has failed? Does the Commission not understand the current threats to the seven UK airports previously owned by BAA? Does it not know that BAA was one of the great commercial successes of privatisation precisely because it had access to the money markets, ran a tight ship, delivered high-quality service to passengers and airlines alike, and looked after the interests of the British people — its shareholders? Ferrovial have managed to destroy all that in barely two years, using an opportunity given to them by the EU. Does the Commission accept any responsibility for such a debacle, or is this yet another example of the Commission's much vaunted ‘shared management’ meaning no management of strategic decisions?
