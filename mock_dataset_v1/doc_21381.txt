solving procedures contained therein. 3. On 1 July 2009 the Commission asked the Dutch authorities to provide her with information on the possible effects of the recent decision of the Dutch Government to abandon ‘depolderisation’ on the conservation status of the Scheldt estuary in general and on the expected ecological effects of the planned deepening of the Scheldt River in particular. The Commission also asked the Dutch authorities to confirm that the planned alternative restoration measures will not lead to a further deterioration of the protected habitats of Community interest but rather contribute to the necessary improvement of their conservation status. The Dutch authorities consider that the nature development measures are necessary to restore a favourable conservation status of the Scheldt estuary, as required by the Habitats Directive, and thus comply with this directive. 4. The Commission has no information indicating that the issue would be linked to the competition between the ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, which, as far as is known, maintain good collegial and neighbourly relations. However, the Commission is aware, as facts seem to indicate, that the absence of the deepening of the navigation channel in the river Scheldt might have negative consequences for the port of Antwerp to keep its sea access and to keep pace with the developments in the size of vessels calling at the most important ports of the world.
