Answer given by Mr Kyprianou on behalf of the Commission (5 September 2005) As regards contingency plans against avian influenza, the recently adopted Commission proposal for a new directive COM(2005)171. on this disease only updates provisions already existing, which are laid down in Council Directive 92/40/EEC of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza OJ L 167, 22.6.1992 . . All Member States already have in place contingency plans to tackle outbreaks of this disease, which have been approved by the Commission in accordance with Decisions 2004/102/EC 2004/102/EC: Commission decision of 26 January 2004 approving contingency plans for the control of avian influenza and Newcastle disease, OJ L 30, 4.2.2004. and 2004/402/EC 2004/402/EC: Commission decision of 26 April 2004 approving contingency plans for the control of avian influenza and Newcastle disease, OJ L 123, 27.4.2004. . In addition, the animal health situation in the EU and in the whole world is regularly reviewed by the Commission and the Member States at the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This exercise continuously provides to the competent authorities in the Member States elements for reflection on their preparedness to control an emergency.
