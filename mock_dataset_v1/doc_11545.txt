WRITTEN QUESTION E-6490/08 by Krzysztof Hołowczyc (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (3 December 2008) Subject: Implementation of the i2010 programme in a period of global economic crisis The global economic crisis is affecting the economic health of the European Union. The painful consequences of that crisis are being felt in various branches of the European economy. One of the most seriously affected sectors is the car industry. Private sector investment capacity has fallen sharply, resulting in a reduction in spending on new technologies in both the private and public sectors. Companies operating in the internal market are clearly seeking economies. It is feared that current conditions could hold back implementation of initiatives taken by the Member States at institutional level. Implementation of the i2010 programme set out in the Commission communications: — ‘Raising Awareness of ICT for Smarter, Safer and Cleaner Vehicles’ (COM(2006)0059) (‘Intelligent Car Initiative’), — ‘Bringing eCall Back on Track — Action Plan (3rd eSafety Communication)’ (COM(2006)0723), — ‘An Energy Policy for Europe’ (COM(2007)0001), — ‘i2010 — Annual Information Society Report 2007’ (COM(2007)0146), should help to reduce spending, throughout the Community, on rescuing traffic accident victims, problems associated with overcrowded roads, environmental pollution and the worsening state of public health. Does the Commission have any details on the progress made in implementing the various elements of the i2010 programme in the Member States, in particular the eCall, ESC, TIC and ITS systems? Which Member States are not fully ready to implement the package by 2010 as planned?
