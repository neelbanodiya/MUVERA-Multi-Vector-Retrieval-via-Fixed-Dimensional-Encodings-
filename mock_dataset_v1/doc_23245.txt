Excessive deficits: Juncker demands more automatic enforcement in sanctions regime Economic and monetary affairs 2010-11-09 - 13:06 Chair of the Eurogroup - Jean-Claude Juncker - at the European Parliament, Monday 8 November Chair of Eurozone Finance Ministers met MEPs on Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee Supports crisis resolution mechanism The European Union should aim for a more automatic enforcement regime than was proposed by the EU leaders when they met on 28 and 29 October in Brussels, said Eurogroup president Jean-Claude Juncker when he appeared before the Economic and Monetary Affairs committee on Monday (8 November). The European Council proposal makes it harder to block imposition of sanctions on Members States with imprudent fiscal policies, but Mr Juncker thinks this does not go far enough. Discussing economic governance with MEPs, Mr Juncker emphasized that the Parliament's views on the issue will have to be taken seriously as any new regime will need its stamp of approval.

Mr Juncker said that introducing reverse majority rule only in the question of imposing sanctions is not enough. Namely, according to the abovementioned proposals, in the procedure leading to decision on sanctions Member States would still vote by ordinary qualified majority voting. This means that sanctions are unlikely ever to be imposed, because this leaves too much space to Member States to evade the real question, Mr Juncker explained.

Mr Juncker said he was very much in favour, "but if
