like cars, appliances, consumer electronics and office equipment and promoting at global level the integration of the environment into transport and energy decisions; SOLIDARITY IN THE EU 11. Stresses that an essential element of a common energy policy should be enhanced solidarity between Member States in order to deal with difficulties related to the physical security of infrastructure and security of supply; considers, furthermore, that such enhanced solidarity would considerably strengthen the capacity of the EU to defend its common interest on energy issues at international level; 12. Advocates strengthening the European Neighbourhood Policy, placing special emphasis on cooperation with the neighbouring countries in the energy field, including transportation infrastructure, to which special financial assistance should be provided; calls for the inclusion of energy policy cooperation in the Action Plans being elaborated under the European Neighbourhood Policy; 13. Calls for an approach based on fairness and shared responsibility in carrying out energy policy at national level, so that, when strategic decisions are taken, those partners among EU Member States which might be affected by the decisions are also consulted; A WELL FUNCTIONING INTERNAL MARKET 14. Strongly holds the view that an essential part of maintaining security of supply is the rapid transposition of current EU provisions by all Member States to achieve a fully functioning internal market in electricity and gas to enhance competitiveness, transparency and energy efficiency; 15. Is deeply concerned, therefore, about the distortion in the internal market caused by protectionist support for national market leaders, and urges the Commission to ensure full implementation of the internal market rules to ensure fair and non-discriminatory competition and avoid the formation of oligopolistic energy markets; 16. Calls on the Council to accept Parliament's position on TENs priorities in order to complete the missing links in trans-European energy networks (TENs) so as to avoid bottlenecks, improve security of supply and complete the internal market by supporting specific projects where appropriate; 17. Urges Member States to create an EU internal energy market by striking a balance between internal and external sources of supply, ensuring interoperability of national energy grids and creating a competitive environment for energy by unbundling supply and distribution functions, while at the same time ensuring competition between distributors; 18. Considers that the evolution of the Kyoto framework after 2012 needs active consideration now, to allow the markets to take into account the cost of carbon in major investment programmes,
