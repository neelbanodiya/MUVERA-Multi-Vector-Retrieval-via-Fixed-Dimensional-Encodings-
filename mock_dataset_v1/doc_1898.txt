WRITTEN QUESTION E-3277/08 by Marios Matsakis (ALDE) to the Commission (13 June 2008) Subject: Court sentences Mengistu to death The Supreme Court of Ethiopia has recently sentenced to death former ruler Mengistu Haile Mariam and many of his associates. They were found guilty of committing genocide during Mengistu's rule of terror in Ethiopia, in which opponents and intellectuals were rounded up, tortured and killed, and their bodies ended up in mass graves or were just thrown into the street for families to collect. Unfortunately Mengistu has fled to Zimbabwe, where he has been given refuge and protection by another of Africa's disreputable rulers, Mr Mugabe. Calls for his extradition have, as expected, been turned down. It is reported that two of Mengistu's political associates who were also sentenced to death live in the Italian Embassy compound in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, where they sought refuge after Mengistu fled the country. Is the Commission aware that the Italian Government is protecting two convicted genocide criminals in Ethiopia? In what way can the Commission persuade the Italian Government to hand over these two individuals to the Ethiopian authorities so as to face the consequences of their atrocious crimes against humanity? Does the Commission know what excuse the Italian Government offers for protecting these criminals and what it intends to do with them in the long term?
