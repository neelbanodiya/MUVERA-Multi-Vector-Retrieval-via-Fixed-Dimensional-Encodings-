Question for written answer E-7907/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Charles Tannock (ECR) (4 October 2010) Subject: Impact of the EU Working Time Directive (WTD) on the quality of professional medical training for UK doctors Since 1 August 2009 the Working Time Directive (2003/88/EC OJ L 299, 18.11.2003, p. 9. ) has applied to trainee doctors in the United Kingdom undergoing professional medical training, and a complex pattern of shift working has been introduced. The Commission will realise that the importance of clinical hands‑on experience in medical training means that trainees regularly exceed the maximum working time of 48 hours per week laid down in the directive. There are countless examples of complex clinical cases continuing for prolonged periods extending over several medical shifts, which are also more time-consuming in their medical management. Does the Commission agree that the reduced time made available for medical trainees under the Working Time Directive will adversely affect the overall quality of the training afforded? Does the Commission accept the fact that some Member States assign the status of higher autonomous professionals to doctors in training and thus exclude them from the rigid restrictions of the EU WTD?
