a key role to play.The role of the social partners are also crucial, that's why the next Tripartite Social Forum will discuss the implementation of the Agenda for ne skills and jobs; forssen in March. Directive 2000/78/EC on equal treatment in employment has been transposed into the national law of all Member States (the deadline for transposition was 2 December 2003). The Commission's 2008 communication COM(2008)225 final, 8.7.2008. on the application of the directive concluded that all Member States had enacted legislation to combat discrimination on all the grounds covered by the directive. After the completion of the transpostion, the challenge has been to ensure that the directive is effectively implemented and enforced. The Commission has monitored the conformity of the Member States’ legislation with the directive in detail. Infringement proceedings against eight Member States for lack of conformity with the directive, which the Commission initiated on the basis of such monitoring, are still under way. Regarding what else the Commission believes it can do to ensure that the directive is implemented, the Commission organises, for instance, technical bilateral meetings with the Member States and consults the network of independent experts in the field of combating discrimination to ensure that the Commission has updated and comprehensive information on national implementation in all Member States.
