9999/C Q999 E/026 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0884/04 by Piia-Noora Kauppi (PPE-DE) to the Council (11 March 2004) Subject: Accession to and withdrawal from the Union and the Euratom Treaty The Euratom Protocol refers to Article I-57 (accession) and I-59 (withdrawal) of the draft Constitution. However, since EURATOM is a separate legal entity from the European Union, there is no connection between accession to the Union and to the Euratom Treaty or between withdrawal from the Union and from the Euratom Treaty. Does that mean that an applicant country may accede to the Union without acceding to the Euratom Community or that a Member State may withdraw from the Euratom Community?
