Answer given by Mr Frattini on behalf of the Commission (21 April 2006) It is the Commission’s understanding of the queries raised by the Honourable Member that these questions refer to the interception of electronic communications by national intelligence services. The Commission is aware of the fact that important differences between Member States exist in this area. Directive 2002/58/EC (‘e-Privacy Directive’) Directive 2002/58/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications), OJ L 201, 31.7.2002. harmonises the provisions of Member States required to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms with respect to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector. According to Article 5(1) of this directive, Member States shall generally prohibit tapping or other kinds of interception and surveillance of communications. However, the directive does not apply to the interception of electronic communications by national intelligence services, since, according to its Article 1(3), the directive shall not apply to activities which fall outside the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Community, such as those covered by Titles V and VI of the Treaty on European Union, and in any case to activities concerning public security, defence, state security (including the economic well-being of the state when the activities relate to state security matters) and the activities of the state in areas of criminal law. Generally speaking, it is the firm policy of the Commission to always strive to assure that a fair balance is struck between the interests of law enforcement and counter-terrorism, on one hand, and the extremely important right to privacy of the citizens and the protection of fundamental rights, on the other hand.
