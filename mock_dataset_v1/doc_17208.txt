Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (17 March 2009) The Commission is deeply concerned about reports of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law during the recent crisis in Gaza. It believes the conduct of both sides should be properly investigated. The Commission will follow closely such investigations and will decide on its further course of action once the findings are known. Regarding the EU’s overall relations with Israel in the context of the Association Agreement, the Commission’s priority at the present time is to focus on Gaza, and in particular the issue of access and provision of humanitarian aid. For these matters, dialogue with Israel is essential, and all channels of diplomatic and political contacts should remain open. Suspending relations with one partner is likely to negatively affect the EU’s influence in the region.
