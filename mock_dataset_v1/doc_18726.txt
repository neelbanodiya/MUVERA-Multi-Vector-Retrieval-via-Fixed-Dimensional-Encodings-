WRITTEN QUESTION E-4755/05 by Jonas Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (15 December 2005) Subject: Situation in Macedonia National minorities face considerable problems in Macedonia, particularly the Roma who live under difficult conditions and are deprived of many rights. Earlier in the autumn, the Roma Rasidova family was deported from Sweden to Macedonia. Since arriving in Macedonia, the family has been separated and they have problems obtaining identity documents from the authorities. The lack of such documents complicates any possible return to Sweden. Taking the long-term perspective of the possible accession of Macedonia to the EU, how has the Commission, in its contacts with that country, raised the issue of the position of national minorities and, in particular, the difficulties of returning refugees in obtaining identity documents?
