Answer given by Mr De Gucht on behalf of the Commission (2 June 2010) The EU‑South Korea Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which is currently being considered by the Council and will be submitted to the Parliament for consent would, once in force, eliminate duties on 99 % In value terms or 96.3% in TLs. of EU agricultural exports to the Republic of Korea. Based on historic exports, this would relieve EU exporters of agricultural products from EUR 380 million of duties every year. Thanks to this FTA, Greek exporters of agricultural products would be able to save EUR 4 million in duties annually. Should Greek exports increase, the savings would be even greater. Greek exporters would be able to benefit from duty elimination for all their historic exports. For example, the FTA would ensure that current Korean duties of 45-50 % on canned peaches are gradually eliminated over 7 years. Korean import duties on fruit salad or mixed fruit would be eliminated even faster i.e. over a 5‑year period. Exports of wine would become duty free from the entry into force of the FTA, just like historic export quantities of cheese. Korean duties on imports of olive oil, pasta and chocolate would be phased out over 5 years. For other products potentially of interest to Greek exporters like mandarines, duties would be eliminated over a longer transitional period. The FTA would furthermore ensure protection of the following Greek geographical indications (GI) in the Republic of Korea from its entry into force: Elia Kalamatas olives, Masticha Chiou gum, Feta cheese, Retsina wine, Samos wine and Ouzo spirit. It will be possible to seek protection of additional GI once the agreement has entered into force. All agricultural GIs, and not only those relating to wines and spirits, will enjoy the same high level of protection.
