Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (21 March 2011) The Commission notes that the site ES7010033 ‘Jandia’ has been designated under the provisions of the Habitats Directive Council Directive 92/43/EEC, of 21 May 1992, on the protection of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora, OJ L 206, 22.7.1992. . In accordance with Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, any plan or project likely to have a negative effect on Natura 2000 sites has to undergo an appropriate assessment having regard to the sites' conservation objectives. In the light of the conclusions of the assessment, the competent authorities shall agree to this plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the sites. If this cannot be ascertained, the plan or project can only proceed under the exceptional conditions set out in Article 6(4) of the directive and must be subject to implementing adequate compensatory measures. According to the information available to the Commission http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/noticias/?module=1&page=nota.htm&id=15321 , the competent authorities have issued an environmental impact statement (Declaración de impacto ecológico) concerning the project of the road section from Tablero de Jaqueta to Costa Calma in the municipality of Pájara, Fuerteventura, Spain. According to the same source of information, the environmental impact statement details measures to minimise the potential negative impacts of the project and specific measures (marking and fencing) for the areas where the species Convolvulus caput-medusae is present. Given the fact that the content of the environmental impact statement has not been made public in full, the Commission will contact the Spanish authorities to ask detailed information on how the provisions of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive have been observed.
