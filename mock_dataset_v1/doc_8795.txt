ORAL QUESTION H-0063/03 for Question Time at the part-session in February 2003 pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure by Hans-Peter Martin to the Commission Subject: Statute of European political parties A Statute of European political parties will shortly be presented. It is proposed that EUR 7 million per calendar year will be allocated to fund such parties.

How will the Commission prevent arbitrary increases from being approved which will have to be paid for by the European taxpayer?
