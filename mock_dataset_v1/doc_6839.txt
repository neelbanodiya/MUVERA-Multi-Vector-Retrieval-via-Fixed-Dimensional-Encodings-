WRITTEN QUESTION E-4656/08 by Jim Higgins (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (28 August 2008) Subject: EU proposal for boiler labelling Could the Commission indicate if it would favour a simplification of labelling practices for boilers at the point of sale by providing an energy-efficiency rating label, removing confusing labelling such as heating load categories and providing separate labels for different fuel sources, so that consumers can make an informed choice, which is not the case under current operating standards?
