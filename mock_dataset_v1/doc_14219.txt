accepting only the minor changes made to the Commission's proposal by Parliament's resolution. The Council wants a trans-European network but clearly sees it only as a juxtaposition of national networks and national policies. In the light of the recent crisis involving Ukraine and Russia and the declarations made at Hampton Court, there is a clear need for a European energy policy. This decision therefore represents an opportunity for the European Institutions to display their willingness to develop one. Your rapporteur believes that the new provisions introducing the declaration of European interest and the possibility of appointing a coordinator are vital tools for ensuring a genuine market in gas and electricity and guaranteeing security of supply. This European network can only be achieved by improving and increasing interconnections. Your rapporteur therefore suggests that either the amendments tabled at first reading or the initial text of the Commission proposal should be reinstated so as to reintroduce these tools and provide the Union with the resources necessary to attain the goals it has set itself.
