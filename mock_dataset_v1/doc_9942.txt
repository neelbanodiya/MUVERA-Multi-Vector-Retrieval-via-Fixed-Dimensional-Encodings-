Answer given by Ms Ferrero-Waldner on behalf of the Commission (5 June 2008) In accordance with Common Position 2001/931/CFSP OJ L 344, 28.12.2001. and Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 OJ L 344, 28.12.2001. , the Council establishes a list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts, notably with a view to freezing their funds and economic resources. This list is regularly updated. The latest version of this Council list is set out in Common Position 2007/871/CFSP OJ L 340, 22.12.2007. Common Position as amended by Common Positions 2008/346/CFSP and 2008/347/CFSP, OJ L 116, 30.4.2008. and Council Decision 2007/868/EC OJ L 340, 22.12.2007. Decision as amended by Decisions 2008/342/EC and 2008/343/EC, OJ L 116, 30.4.2008. . The Council is making this list on the basis of proposals submitted by Member States and third countries. These legal instruments were put in place further to United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001) and therefore correspond to obligations of the Member States under the Charter of the United Nations. For good order, it should be noted that they supplement similar instruments targeting Al Qa’ida and the Taliban, for which a UN list exists. The Court of First Instance judgments concerning People’s Mujahedin of Iran (PMOI) of 12 December 2006 and Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its alias Kongra‑Gel of 3 April 2008 annulled Council Decisions made pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, which were made prior to 2007. The Council Decisions made in 2007 were adopted in accordance with a new procedure set out in Council document 10826/1/07 REV 1 of 28 June 2007 This information is also summarised in a fact sheet available on the Council website: http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/080206_combatterrorism_EN.pdf . Some appeals against these Decisions are currently pending in the Court of First Instance.
