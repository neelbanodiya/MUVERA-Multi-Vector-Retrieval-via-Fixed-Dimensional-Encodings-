Answer given by Mr Špidla on behalf of the Commission (30 October 2009) The Commission’s attention has already been drawn to the issue raised by the Honourable Member. After making an initial examination, it has decided to request further information from the competent national authorities with a view to examining the case in greater detail. Where that examination reveals a general failure to enforce the obligation laid down in Framework Directive 89/391/EEC, the Commission will take the requisite measures. These may include initiating an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 226 of the EC Treaty.
