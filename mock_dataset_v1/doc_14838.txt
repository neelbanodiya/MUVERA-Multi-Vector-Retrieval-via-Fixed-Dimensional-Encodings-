3. Notes that M&A remains the most frequent growth strategy of financial institutions; notes also that, in a modern economy, the effects of consolidation can be achieved in many different ways, such as through commercial alliances between institutions, outsourcing or in-sourcing of back-office operations, back-office cooperation, and the creation of common infrastructures with competitors (e.g. payment clearing and settlement systems); 4. Welcomes the positive effects of the euro and the FSAP on the integration of wholesale financial markets, on market transparency and liquidity, and on modernising and completing the EU's financial regulatory framework even though not all the consequences of the single currency to the integration of the financial markets have yet been realised; 5. Notes that M&A and restructuring activity, which is likely to have a positive effect on competitiveness, is often accompanied by a negative perception of fear of loss of employment, which materialises at times, particularly in certain regions; 6. Takes note of the intensive consolidation via cross-border M&A in the new Member States in the last 10 years; in this respect, also recalls the importance of sound and stable financial systems for small economies; 7. Recalls that consolidation should not be a political objective per se , but should bring clear benefits to the economy by stimulating growth, encouraging innovation, ensuring competition, improving access to funding, allowing financial institutions to exploit synergies and cost efficiencies, and giving consumers a greater choice and better quality, while ensuring an adequate level of consumer protection; 8. Asks for attention to be focused on the effects of consolidation in the financial sector on employment, by restructuring ownership and activities, and by outsourcing in particular; urges the sector to take full social responsibility and to provide for accompanying measures that lead to retraining and qualifying financial institutions' staff to fit in with the Lisbon Strategy goals of becoming a more knowledge-intensive economy; 9. Believes that the diversity of financial institutions, which better reflects the variety of financing needs of corporate entities, SMEs and consumers, should be preserved and that, therefore, EC legislation should not favour any single type of business model or corporate structure or any single type of product over another; 10. Considers that the architecture of financial services at EU level should be such as to guarantee the co-existence of different structures and sizes in order to provide for efficient and competitive players both at international level and within
