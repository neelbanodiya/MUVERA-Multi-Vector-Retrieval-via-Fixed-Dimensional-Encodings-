Answer given by Mr Byrne on behalf of the Commission (19 November 2004) In recent months the Commission has continued to press the Greek authorities to take the action necessary to deal with weaknesses in food safety, animal health and animal welfare control systems. An inspection by the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO), focusing on animal welfare at slaughter and during transport, took place in Greece from the 4 to 8 October 2004. During this inspection, the FVO team was informed that there are four different processes under way for the recruitment of permanent and temporary contract staff. However, at present, the situation at field level remains unchanged and there is a serious lack of staff available to effectively implement EU legislation. In the absence of appropriate assurances from the Greek authorities that they will urgently address the long-standing problem of insufficient staffing of control services, the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Greece on 18 October 2004 asking the Greek Government effectively to address the problem within two months. Failure to do so could lead the Commission to bring the case before the Court of Justice. The Commission is also considering similar action on the system of approval of meat establishments in Greece and on control systems for animal welfare. Further FVO inspections are planned for later in 2004 on the control of contaminants in animal feed and on pesticides. The Commission is keeping the overall situation in Greece under close review. Commission officials are in regular contact with the Greek authorities to impress on them the need for quick and effective action.
