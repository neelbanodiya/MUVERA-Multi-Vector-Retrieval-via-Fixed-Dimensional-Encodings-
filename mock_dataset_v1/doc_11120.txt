Question for written answer E-008599/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Izaskun Bilbao Barandica (ALDE) (29 September 2011) Subject: Driving licence for recreational vehicles In recent years, including the last two years of serious economic crisis, the number of motor homes being put on the road has increased. In 2010 alone, 68 388 such vehicles were registered in the EU, 1.7 % more than the previous year, while caravan sales slumped by over 5 %. The increasing number of motor home users and the varying treatment they receive in different Member States in terms of safety, responsibilities, availability of services, minimum restrictions and rights etc. has started to give rise to problems. In view of the increase in popularity of this type of vehicle and the growing number of users (already over 700 000 in Europe) could the Commission say: 1. Whether it sees a need to establish rules to organise the way in which these vehicles are used, their coexistence with other road-users and, in particular, their use in urban areas? 2. Whether it sees a need to lay down minimum access conditions and generally applicable rules on parking spaces and their conditions, provisions at service stations, waste management, etc.?
