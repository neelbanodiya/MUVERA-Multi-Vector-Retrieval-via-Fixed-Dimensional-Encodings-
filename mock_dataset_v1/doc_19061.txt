Question for written answer E-004008/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Chountis (GUE/NGL) (29 April 2011) Subject: Environmental inspections in Greece On the basis of Recommendation 2001/331/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections, environmental inspectors in the Member States have been given major responsibilities, such as the inspection of industrial and other plant requiring authorisation in respect of environmental emissions, effluent, waste disposal, etc., with a view to ensuring compliance with EU rules. In view of European Parliament resolution P6_TA(2008)0568 calling on the Commission to strengthen the institutional status of the inspectors and give them greater responsibilities and given the importance attached by the recommendation to demarcation between the bodies issuing authorisations and those carrying out inspections: Can the Commission confirm that in Greece the special environmental inspectorate enjoys the institutional (administrative, legal and financial) independence necessary for the performance of its tasks? Can it confirm that the inspectors are sufficient in number and suitably qualified (in terms of c specialist scientific knowledge, education and training) and that they have the necessary technical infrastructures and financial resources, given that the scope of their duties far exceeds the minimum provided for in the recommendation? Can the Commission give specific answers to all the above questions?
