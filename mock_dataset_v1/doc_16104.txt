Answer given by Mr Oettinger on behalf of the Commission (13 May 2011) 1. The choice to use nuclear power or not in the national energy mix and to extend the lifetime of existing installations is a sovereign decision of every Member State. In the Accession Treaty, there is no obligation for Slovenia to abandon the use of nuclear energy. 2.-3. It is the role of the EU to develop the most advanced legal framework for nuclear energy. The European Commission pays particular attention to the respect of the highest nuclear safety standards in Member States which have decided to use nuclear energy. Following the events in Japan, on 25 March 2011 the European Council concluded that the safety of all EU nuclear plants should be reviewed on the basis of comprehensive and transparent risk and safety assessments. The aim of this audit is to determine potential risks associated with nuclear installations in the light of the events in Japan and the nuclear power plant in Krško (Slovenia) will be duly assessed in the framework of this audit. The Commission gives its views on nuclear investment projects notified under the Euratom Treaty. Each investment project must include an environmental impact assessment, which is assessed by the Commission in a separate procedure. Slovenia has not yet notified any new investment project.
