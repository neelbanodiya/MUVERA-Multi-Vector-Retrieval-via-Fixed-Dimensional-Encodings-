SITCEN is now part of the European External Action Service (EEAS). Article 4(3)(a) of Council Decision 2010/427/EU of 26 July 2010 establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service provides that the central administration of the EEAS shall include, inter alia , the European Union Situation Centre, placed under the direct authority and responsibility of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. According to the same article, ‘the specificities of these structures, as well as the particularities of their functions, recruitment and the status of the staff shall be respected’. Since the internal organisation of the EEAS comes under the responsibility of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the Honourable Member is requested to take up this matter directly with the High Representative.
