Reply (19 July 2010) In all its relations with third countries, including Israel, the Council attaches high importance to respect for human rights and democratic principles. In the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the EU and the State of Israel, human rights and democratic principles constitute an essential element of the Agreement that guide the policy of both parties and form a basis for their relations. In addition, the Council participates in regular dialogue with the State of Israel through the Informal Working Group on Human Rights. In relation to the Israeli military operation against the flotilla, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy issued a declaration on behalf of the EU on 3 June 2010, which condemned ‘the use of violence that had produced a high number of victims among the members of the flotilla’ and demanded an ‘immediate, full and impartial inquiry into the events and the circumstances surrounding them’. Furthermore, the Council adopted on 14 June 2010 conclusions relating to the situation regarding Gaza, stressing that it ‘stands ready to contribute to the implementation of a mechanism based on the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access that would permit the reconstruction of Gaza and the revival of its economy’. The Council believes that dialogue with Israel in the framework of the political arrangements as set out in the Association Agreement and in the ENP Action Plan remains, for the time being, the most effective way to discuss with the Israeli government the EU’s concerns regarding respect for human rights and international law, and to encourage positive steps.
