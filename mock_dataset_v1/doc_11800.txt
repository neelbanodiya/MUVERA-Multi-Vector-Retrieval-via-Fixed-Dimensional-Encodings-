of protection which is already provided by the Member States as regards family reunification in the areas covered by this Directive. Justification It should be pointed out that the Directive lays down minimum standards and that the Member States are fully entitled to adopt more favourable rules on family reunification. Furthermore, the Directive is in line with the customary position relating to international human rights conventions, Article 63 of the EC Treaty and the practice adopted by the European Union in other sectors such as the environment, social issues and consumer protection.

The wording is based on Article 3 of the Geneva Convention, Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well as Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
