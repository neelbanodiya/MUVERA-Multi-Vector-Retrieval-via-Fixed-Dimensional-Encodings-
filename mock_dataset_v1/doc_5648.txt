enlargement and negotiations with candidates MEPs debated candidate countries' preparedness to join the EU on several occasions. In 2005, they gave the green light to starting membership negotiations with Turkey and with Croatia. MEPs also supported the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia becoming a candidate for EU accession, though negotiations have not yet started. In a July 2008 resolution on the enlargement process, MEPs called for the preparedness of candidates and the capacity of absorption of the Union to be taken into account.
