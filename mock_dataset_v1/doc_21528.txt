ORAL QUESTION H-0854/08 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2008 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Antonios Trakatellis to the Commission Subject: Revision of Council Recommendation on Cancer Screening It is recognised that early diagnosis, together with prevention, are the most important measures to combat cancer and can cover up to 70% of cases. Given that one year has now elapsed since the European Parliament adopted the text of a written declaration ( P6_TA(2007)0434 ) calling on the Commission review all existing measures with a view to drawing up an updated and integrated strategy for controlling cancer, what actions has the Commission taken so far to this end? Bearing in mind that the European Parliament resolution ( P6_TA(2008)0121 ) on combating cancer, adopted in April 2008, stressed the need to revise Council Recommendation 2003/878/EC on cancer screening so as to include better diagnostic techniques and more types of cancer, when does the Commission intend to revise this Recommendation and submit it to the European Parliament?
