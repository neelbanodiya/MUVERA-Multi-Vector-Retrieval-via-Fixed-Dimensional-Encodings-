Answer given by Mr Šemeta on behalf of the Commission (6 January 2012) The Commission is of the opinion that it is important to move towards an economy based on re-use and recycling as is mentioned in the recently launched Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe (COM(2011) 751 final). The market already gives signals for the scarcity of some resources by means of rising commodity prices. However, the cost of externalities may still remain unaddressed. Market based instruments have a strong role to play in correcting market failures — for example by introducing environmental taxes, charges, tradable permit schemes, fiscal incentives for more environmentally-friendly consumption or other instruments. ‘Green tax reforms’, which consist of increasing the share of environmental taxes, while reducing labour taxation and social-security contributions can pave the way to a more sustainable growth. The Commission encourages Member States to reform their tax systems in a more environmentally friendly direction.
