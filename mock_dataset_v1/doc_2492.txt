international community on the links between migration and development; regards it as a matter of urgency to establish legal and administrative procedures to facilitate the granting of visas, in particular for the stakeholders in the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, students, university staff and socio-economic players; stresses that it is important and necessary to reduce the cost of transfers of remittances by migrant workers so as to maximise their use in the local economy; 24. Asks the Commission to keep it fully informed about progress on the association agreement with Syria, the signing of which was recently postponed by Syria; considers that there are some concerns, such as bringing Libya back into negotiations for an association agreement and, more generally, into the UfM; asks the Commission to keep it fully informed and involved and to consult it at every stage in the negotiations; 25. Notes, too, that several Mediterranean countries have expressed interest in deepening and/or widening their trade agreements with the EU, and asks the Commission, in view of the new powers in relation to trade conferred on Parliament by the Treaty of Lisbon, to take an earlier resolution by Parliament into account when negotiating these new agreements; 26. Stresses that bilateral approaches should not be at the expense of a multilateral regional approach; believes that, while advocating closer cooperation with the most advanced partners, and with due regard for their specific political, cultural and social characteristics, the Commission must maintain the principle of region-to-region negotiations; 27. Stresses that, in view of the Palestinian situation, specific and special measures should be taken to assist the population with a view to integrating this area into Mediterranean trade flows; in that respect, considers that a solution should be found to address the issue of certification of origin and subsequent preferential treatment under the EC-Israel Association Agreement applicable to goods coming from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank; 28. Considers that a balanced Road Map based on a broad consensus and, inter-alia, a positive social and environmental impact assessment, could be a useful instrument for relaunching economic and trade cooperation in coming years; calls, therefore, on the Euro-Mediterranean Trade Ministers to endorse it at their ministerial meeting in December 2009; calls on the Euro-Mediterranean Trade Senior Officials to monitor the implementation of the Road Map in the coming years and propose any necessary adjustments, and asks to be kept informed of such measures; 29.
