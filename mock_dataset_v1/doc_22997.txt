in some respects rigid and frequently leads in practice to legal uncertainty, hampering planned investment; calls, therefore, on the Commission to examine to what extent the rules could be simplified in order to establish a more investment-friendly framework so as to promote investment and innovation and remove obstacles to broadband roll-out particularly in those areas where they would otherwise have been unprofitable; considers that the Community Guidelines for the application of State aid rules in relation to rapid deployment of broadband networks should, in addition, serve to clarify the setting up of public broadband companies and the cooperation between municipalities and public-private partnership models; calls on the Commission and the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), in consultation with public authorities, to facilitate public-private partnerships and employ other European sources of financing, not least ERDF, EIB, and EBRD funds; 9. Calls on regional and local authorities and businesses to use ERDF funding to improve broadband coverage, in particular in rural areas; 10. Supports rapid expansion of broadband infrastructure and calls on the Member States to give effect without delay to the NGA recommendation aimed at improving legal certainty, investment, and competition; considers that regulators must ensure that all market players at any one time have sufficient incentives to enter into competition and invest; 11. Points to the fact that the geographical and natural features of some regions, in particular their hilly and difficult terrains, make land-line internet access impracticable and that new-generation wireless terrestrial services are an alternative means of achieving the broadband cover target in such regions; 12. Calls on the Commission to give particular importance to public-private partnerships and facilitate the use of structural instruments within this context; 13. Points out that the definition of basic provision will have to be adjusted in future in line with changed requirements resulting from the ever increasing transmission rates being recorded by innovative internet services such as e-government, e-health, or e-learning; calls, therefore, on the Commission, in view of the likely failure of the market to supply rural, insular and mountainous areas with NGA networks, to incorporate new organisational models, providing in particular for the involvement of local authorities, such as citizens’ networks and publicly run networks or those acquired using public funds, for the provision and financing of high-speed and ultra-high-speed networks as an option into the Community Guidelines for the application of State aid rules in relation
