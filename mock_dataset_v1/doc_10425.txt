Answer given by Mr Potočnik on behalf of the Commission (15 February 2012) The Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC OJ L 206, 22.7.1992, p. 7. and the Birds Directive 2009/147/EC OJ L 20, 26.1.2010, p. 7. do not forbid the reconstruction and resurfacing of a road in or near Natura 2000 sites. The compatibility of such a development with the protection of the concerned sites needs to be determined on a case by case basis. It is up to the competent national authorities to assess whether such a project would cause significant negative effects on the relevant species and habitats and on the integrity of the concerned Natura 2000 site. The procedures and rules set by Article 6 of the Habitats Directive have to be followed. In particular, in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 3, any plan or project likely to have a significant effect upon a Natura 2000 site has to be subject to an appropriate assessment and the competent authorities may agree to this plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site. The information available to the Commission does not indicate any potential breach of the abovementioned provisions by the Italian authorities.
