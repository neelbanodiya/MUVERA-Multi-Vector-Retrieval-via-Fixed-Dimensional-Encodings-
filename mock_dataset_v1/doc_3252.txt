this request. In this respect, the EMPL committee presents some remarks without, however, putting into question the transfer of the payments . The deliberations of the EMPL committee are based on the following considerations: A) Whereas this application is based on Article 2a) of the EGF regulation and targets to support 825 workers of the total of 1 650 workers dismissed within the reference period between 1 January 2010 and 30 April 2010 as well as workers made redundant before and after this period. B) Whereas the Danish authorities argue that the redundancies were caused by major structural changes in the wind turbine market worldwide which are reflected in a substantial decrease in new EU wind capacity over the last 5 years (from 70,7 % in 2004 to 27,3% in 2009) and, in turn, rapidly expanding Asian markets, which in 2009 accounted already for 40,4% of the new wind capacity worldwide; C) Whereas these circumstances made wind turbines producers move the production closer to the most dynamic end-user markets in order to ensure their market position, while benefitting from lower labour costs in Asia and decreasing the costs related to the transport of heavy and big wind turbines; D) Whereas, in addition to the changes in trade patterns, the financial and economic crises affected the European market of wind turbines, causing a sudden reduction in EU demand combined with the constant growth in wind power demand in Asia; whereas this situation pushed LM Glasfiber to reduce production facilities in Lunderskov and Hammelev and enter a strategic partnership with a Chinese partner; E) Whereas the municipalities of Haderslev, Kolding and Vejen, heavily dependant on the wind turbine industry, noted a 25% increase in unemployment rate in 2009 affecting especially low skilled workers; whereas due to decreasing demand for wind turbine in the EU those municipalities may most probably face major challenges to reintegrate the redundant workers into the labour market; F) Whereas, however, the Danish authorities estimate that 50% of the dismissed workers are expected to re-enter the labour market on their own; G) Whereas 73,45 % of the workers targeted by the measures are men and 26,55 % are women; whereas 79,39 % of the workers are between 25 and 54 years old and more than 10% are under the age of 24; H) Whereas the EU-budget 2011 includes for the first time appropriations in payments on the EGF budget
