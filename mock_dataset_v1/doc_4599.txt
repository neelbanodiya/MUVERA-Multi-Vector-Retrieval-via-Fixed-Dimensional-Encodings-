Reply (20 September 2010) On 17 June 2010, after receiving favourable opinions from the Parliament and the Commission, the European Council adopted a decision EUCO 11/10. to pursue the necessary procedure to adopt the transitional measures regarding the addition of 18 seats in the European Parliament until the end of the present 2009‑14 parliamentary term and convened a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States with a view to amending Protocol No 36 to the Treaties. On 23 June 2010, the conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States approved the Protocol amending Protocol No 36 as set out in the annex to EUCO 11/10. Pursuant to Article 1 of that Protocol, 18 seats will be added to the existing 736 seats in the European Parliament: four seats for Spain, two seats each for Austria, Sweden and France and one seat each for Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Poland, Italy, Slovenia, Latvia, Malta and the United Kingdom. This Protocol is now open for ratification by the Member States. Pursuant to Article 2 thereof, it will enter into force if possible on 1 December 2010, provided that all the instruments of ratification have been deposited or, failing that, on the first day of the month following the deposit of the instrument of ratification by the last signatory State to take this step. The Protocol as approved by the conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States provides for three options for appointing the new MEPs within each Member State concerned: (a) in ad hoc elections by direct universal suffrage in the Member State concerned, in accordance with the provisions applicable for elections to the European Parliament; (b) by reference to the results of the European Parliament elections from 4 to 7 June 2009; or (c) by designation, by the national parliament of the Member State concerned from among its members, of the requisite number of members, according to the procedure determined by each of those Member States. For each of those three options, the appointments are to be carried out in accordance with the legislation of the Member State concerned and provided that the persons in question have been elected by direct universal suffrage.
