WRITTEN QUESTION E-3327/08 by Manolis Mavrommatis (PPE-DE) to the Commission (13 June 2008) Subject: Financial exclusion in the EU According to research on avoiding financial exclusion in the EU presented by the Commission on 28 May 2008, 20% of adults in EU-15 and 49% of adults in the new Member States do not have a bank account and are thus also excluded from broader financial and social activities. The Commissioner responsible for employment has stated that the public authorities, both at national and at European levels, are responsible for ensuring that all Europeans have access to the financial services they require. Will the Commission say what it is doing to ensure this? What is being done to protect low-paid workers who are the principal victims of financial and, by extension, social exclusion, especially today when the high cost of living is the main problem in all EU Member States?
