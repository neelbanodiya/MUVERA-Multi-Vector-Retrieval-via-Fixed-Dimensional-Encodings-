ORAL QUESTION H-0409/04 for Question Time at the part-session in November 2004 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Diamanto Manolakou to the Commission Subject: Ecological disaster in Lake Koronia in Greece An ecological disaster is developing in Lake Koronia, which has a 52-kilometre shoreline, although the lake has protected status under the Ramsar Convention and 'Natura 2000'. A month ago, thousands of birds died at the lake, and recently thousands of dead fish were found floating on the surface of the water. A microscopic examination of the water showed that it contained an extremely high level of phytoplankton, and the death of the fish is attributed to this. Experts point out that sewage from the public sewerage system is discharged into the lake untreated, which is probably responsible for this ecological disaster. Will the Commission immediately investigate the causes of this environmental disaster? Will it take measures to save Lake Koronia and restore the natural environment in the region? Will it ensure that the discharge of sewage into the lake is halted?
