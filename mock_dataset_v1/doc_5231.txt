capabilities which use state of the art technology to keep security threats to a minimum, F. whereas, despite the EU potential regarding research and development security technologies, the lack of a specific framework for security research at EU level and the high level of fragmentation and duplication in security research systems and infrastructures generate significant obstacles to delivering cost-effective solutions, G. whereas the total United States investment in homeland security is on average four times greater than that invested by Europe, and this investment, which does not include research into dual-use technologies funded by the US Department of Defense, is spread across a range of US departments thus representing a comprehensive approach to security research; H. whereas the investment in research and development in the defence sector in Member States is approximately five times less than the corresponding investment in the US, increasing the risk of the EU becoming more vulnerable and dependent in this field, I. whereas the distinction between civil and military research is becoming increasingly blurred, J. whereas security research could play a strategic role in enhancing Europe's industrial competitiveness and in strengthening its scientific and technological base, as established by the Lisbon and Barcelona objectives, 1. Welcomes the Commission proposal for a European Security Research Programme (ESRP); stresses the need to develop a structured and efficient security research programme at Union level, in order to address current and future security challenges and clearly-defined European requirements, to enhance the security and safety of European citizens and to ensure European credibility and effectiveness in ESDP operations, while contributing to the growth and competitiveness of the European economy; 2. Considers that an efficient security research programme should be based on a coordinated reference framework, involving relevant security research stakeholders and appropriate and rationalised funding, and should be built on existing Community experience in the management of joint research programmes; 3. Underlines the public-interest nature of all aspects relating to security research, and accordingly calls for the programmes and projects in this field to be given sufficient stability and for the budgetary allocation to be linked to the trend in gross domestic product, so as to secure the greatest possible continuity over time and the best results; The European Security Research Programme and its financing 4. Takes note of the Commission's proposal to develop the ESRP as part of the Seventh EU Research Framework Programme; underlines that the ESRP should
