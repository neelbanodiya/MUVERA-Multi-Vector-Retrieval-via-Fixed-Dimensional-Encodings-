WRITTEN QUESTION E-6824/08 by Dragoş Florin David (PPE‑DE) , Rareş-Lucian Niculescu (PPE‑DE) and Marian Zlotea (PPE‑DE) to the Commission (19 December 2008) Subject: Threefold increase in car tax for Romanian citizens The Romanian Government set a new rate of pollution tax for cars by order published on 8 December 2008. Under the same order, vehicles with an engine capacity of 2000 cc or less that are registered for the first time in Romania or in other European Union Member States are exempt from paying this tax during the period from 15 December 2008 to 31 December 2009. All cars that comply with the Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards are also exempt from car tax, as are electric and hybrid cars. In the context of the current difficult economic situation, measures to support industries operating in the EU Member States are welcome. Romanian citizens see the introduction of this tax as discriminatory, since it will have the effect of discouraging imports of second-hand cars. Can the Commission say whether the above measure complies with EU legislation in this field?
