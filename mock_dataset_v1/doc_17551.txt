Overall, this leaves total commitments for the heading at 2.48 billion (+ 19 % compared to 2005) with a margin of EUR 1.08 billion. Overall payments stand at 3.02 billion in the DB. 22. For heading 8, compensations, the Council accepted the PDB proposal of 1.073 billion and set the margin available under this Heading at EUR 499.668. Budget 2005 23.
