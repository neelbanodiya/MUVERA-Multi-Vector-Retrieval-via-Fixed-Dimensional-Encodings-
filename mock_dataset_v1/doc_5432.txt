WRITTEN QUESTION P-3244/04 by Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (30 November 2004) Subject: Insufficiency of social indicators The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy's requirement for the drafting of EU commonly agreed social indicators has been seriously delayed. The Indicators Subgroup at the DG Employment and Social Affairs drew up only a few indicators. 1. What will be done to rectify this delay ? Large areas of the social life of the EU are now without commonly agreed EU social indicators: — homelessness — adequate housing — equal opportunities for children — street children — child labour — school drop-outs — adult illiteracy — drug addiction — prostitution — people trafficking. Without social indicators, these are areas of EU darkness. EU statistics do not measure them. Without commonly agreed social indicators, the EU strategies, programmes and the funding in these areas are very likely to be compromised, since progress cannot be measured without indicators. 2. What will the new Commission do immediately in order to achieve common agreement on EU social indicators regarding these social areas?
