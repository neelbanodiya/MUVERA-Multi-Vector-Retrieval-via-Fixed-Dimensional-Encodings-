States have failed to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Work of global and European institutions MEPs give qualified approval to the work of the UN Human Rights Council, while noting that EU Member States are "in a minority position in the UNHRC" and calling for the EU to build alliances with countries that continue to defend "the universal and indivisible nature of human rights", in other words rejecting cultural relativism. The drive in 2008 by the Slovenian and French EU presidencies to finalise guidelines on children's rights is a step forward but more needs to be done to protect children caught up in armed conflict. Similarly, women's rights, including violence against women, became a priority under the French presidency but there are still gaps in EU policies in this field. MEPs believe that human rights defenders, whose own lives are often threatened, should be granted emergency visas more easily to enable them to take refuge in EU states. Overall, argues the draft report, the EU should use its combined weight to greater effect. Quantifiable indices and benchmarks need to be devised to measure the effectiveness of EU human rights policies. And the approaches to human rights of the Commission and Member States in their missions and embassies outside the EU should be harmonised. 2009-03-30 Committee on Foreign Affairs In the chair Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI EPP-ED PL 20090330IPR52888 Foreign Affairs Committee web site Annual Report on Human Rights in the World 2008 and the European Union's policy on the matter EN 1 LINK /activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=AFET EN 2 LINK /oeil/file.jsp?id=5731552 -//EP//DTD IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN -//EP//STYLESHEET IM-PRESS 20050901 IPR DOC XML V0//EN
