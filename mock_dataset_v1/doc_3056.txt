WRITTEN QUESTION E-5507/09 by Roger Helmer (ECR) to the Commission (13 November 2009) Subject: Level of financial standing Is the Commission aware that its regular reassessment of the level of the financial standing requirement for lorry drivers is disproportionately detrimental to EU citizens outside of the Eurozone? Is the Commission aware that setting financial requirements based on currency exchange rates only once every five years is unsustainable for small business operators, such as one based in my East Midlands constituency? Will the Commission consider delaying an established requirement until after the current global economic decline has become more stable?
