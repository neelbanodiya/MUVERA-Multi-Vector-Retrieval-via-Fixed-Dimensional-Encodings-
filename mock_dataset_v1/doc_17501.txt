99% 99% including Cohesion Fund 63% 63% 8. The implementation as of 19 September 2005 is high, very similar to the rates of 2004 (63% both in 2004 and 2005) and even higher for Objective 3 and for Community Initiatives. It was however lower for the Cohesion Fund, for the Objective 2 and for innovative measures and technical assistance. 2006 Forecasts by Member States 9. Under the terms of the Structural Funds regulation Council Regulation 1260/1999, Article 32(7). "the Member States shall send the Commission their updated forecasts of applications for payment for the current year and the forecast for the following year" by 30 April of each year. Member States are asked to submit their forecasts for each individual programme and within each programme, by Fund. 10. The Member States in their forecasts for the year 2006 estimate that they need 44.394,5 million euro in payment appropriations for the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, compared with the 35.223,2 million foreseen in the Commission's PDB (see Annex 1). Your rapporteurs therefore underline that the Commission's PDB proposed 9,2 billion euro less than the Member States forecast as their payments needs. 11. The Commission notes that the Member States have been making forecasting errors, but it should be noted that there was an improvement in 2004 when the forecasting error for the EU-15 programmes came down to 23% (from 51% in 2003) The new Member States only submitted their first detailed forecast in 2004, so there is no sufficient base for comparison over time for the EU-10 programmes and therefore too early to draw telling conclusions. . 12. Your rapporteurs believe that the Member States´ payment needs forecasts are a relevant budgetary planning tool and, therefore, should be taken into consideration during the budgetary negotiations. N+2 rule 13. The Commission shall automatically decommit any part of a commitment for which it has not received an acceptable payment application by the end of the second year following the year of commitment and therefore the contribution from the Funds to that assistance shall be reduced by that amount. This novelty, which has been named as the N+2 rule , aims at and apparently is able to keep outstanding commitments for structural operations down to acceptable levels. 14. 2003 was the first year of N+2 decommitments for the programming period 2000-2006. The total amount decommitted under the N+2 rule was € 31.1 million
