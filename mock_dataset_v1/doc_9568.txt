WRITTEN QUESTION P-0155/10 by Carlos Coelho (PPE) to the Commission (19 January 2010) Subject: Frontex The European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union — Frontex — was set up in 2005 in order to improve integrated border management, thus making for a high degree of oversight and security at the borders, this being a sine qua non for the existence of an area of freedom, security, and justice. Even though the latest Frontex General Report paints quite an encouraging picture, the agency’s operating capability is being severely undermined by the fact that the supply of essential resources depends ultimately on the goodwill of the Member States. In reality, the resources supposedly made available by the Member States (CRATE) have more often than not fallen short of what is required. Will the amendments currently being drafted to the Frontex Regulation serve to remedy this situation? To what extent could the Member States’ participation be established on a binding basis? Or are own resources an idea now being considered? Could specific guidelines eventually be produced with a view to achieving greater uniformity? In addition, the Rapid Border Intervention Teams — Rabits — were set up in 2007, but, although they are being trained and carry out exercises twice a year (with all the costs which that entails), they have in practice never been used. Given that serious doubts are at present being raised about their usefulness, could not the necessary change be brought about by amending the relevant regulation and hence enabling the teams to be deployed not just in exceptional situations, but also in joint operations?
