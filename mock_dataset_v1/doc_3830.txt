WRITTEN QUESTION E-2572/08 by Marco Cappato (ALDE) to the Council (6 May 2008) Subject: Political dialogue in Cameroon and the situation of Southern Cameroons In its declaration of 27 March 2008 on the situation in Cameroon the Presidency stated that ‘the European Union recalls that the Constitution adopted in 1996 was the outcome of political dialogue and the democratic expression of the will of the people’. Despite the new Constitution, over the years several international NGOs such as Human Rights Watch, UNPO and Amnesty International have repeatedly stated that the situation of human rights in Cameroon remained worrying, with particular regard to the condition of human rights defenders, wrongfully-imprisoned journalists, the effectiveness of the Human Rights Commission and irregularities in elections. In this respect the situation seems to be particularly alarming in the Anglophone region known as Southern Cameroons. The political dialogue which led to the 1996 Constitution did not take into account the views of representatives of Southern Cameroons, since Anglophone representatives withdrew from the Constitutional drafting committees and the final outcome of this process was based on a draft produced directly by the cabinet of the President of Cameroon. Moreover, the Constitution adopted in 1996 granted greater autonomy to the provinces (renamed regions) and established a Senate as the upper house to the National Assembly. Nevertheless, none of these provisions has been implemented. Will the Presidency promote the full implementation of the Constitution of 1996 and establish a road map for dialogue between Cameroon's Government and opposition groups, in particular Anglophone Cameroonians? Will the Council report on progress made on this issue to the European Parliament?
