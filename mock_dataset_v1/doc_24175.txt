in its external relations, L. whereas a reliable risk assessment of energy security should be established as part of a common European foreign policy on energy, and whereas in this connection the recently established NESCO should play a decisive role, in which the necessary monitoring capacities for an early warning system must also be in place, M. whereas joint efforts should be redoubled in the field of research into, and utilisation of, renewable energies and energy efficiency, both within the EU and in cooperation with external partners and third countries, 1. Calls for the development of a common European foreign policy on energy which would significantly contribute to guaranteeing energy security for the whole of the EU, while at the same time pursuing the objective of sustainability at the international level, thus providing EU citizens with substantial added value to efforts made at national level; 2. Considers that energy policy must be an integrated and prominent part of the common foreign policy, and that energy policy should be taken into account in all foreign policy contexts; 3. Stresses that, whilst the Member States should retain their sovereign right to make strategic choices concerning the energy mix, to exploit their energy resources and to decide on the supply structures, there is a need to elaborate concrete provisions, to be included in the Treaties, leading to the creation of a common European foreign policy on energy, covering security of supply, transit and investment related to energy security, and the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings as well as clean and renewable energy sources, particularly in relations with countries whose energy consumption is growing rapidly; 4. Calls for a suitable Treaty basis for energy and energy security; 5. Stresses that a comprehensive European foreign policy on energy must contribute to the promotion and implementation of the values and interests of the European Union and the main aims of its foreign policy, namely the safeguarding of peace and the primacy of human rights, democracy and the rule of law; recognises that the EU's dependency on imported energy may have significant effects on the independence of its decision-making in other policy areas; 6. Regards it as vital for the EU to continue to lead the global fight against climate change, which among other risks may lead to substantial migratory movements and security threats, and to fulfil the targets of the Kyoto Protocol to the
