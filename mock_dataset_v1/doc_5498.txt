WRITTEN QUESTION E-0899/09 by Joel Hasse Ferreira (PSE) to the Council (12 February 2009) Subject: Discrimination against European workers in the UK Demonstrations by British workers against the announcement that workers from Portugal and other countries, contracted by a European company, were heading for the United Kingdom, have raised various issues. It is understandable, that the UK, with rising unemployment, is facing a difficult situation, and that many workers should be sensitive to ambiguous slogans and chauvinist rhetoric, when they see what they deem to be their direct interests threatened. There has been a very positive response from Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who heads a government that includes major figures like David Milliband and Peter Mandelson, men of European and worldwide experience and prestige. Will the Czech Presidency of the European Union be providing back-up in this matter? What additional guarantees will be given that European rules on the movement of workers and the principles of solidarity and European social cohesion will be respected?
