WRITTEN QUESTION P-6662/08 by Mary Honeyball (PSE) to the Commission (11 December 2008) Subject: Sexualisation of young girls on a Commission website I have just come across the new DG Health and Consumer Protection website aimed at children, http://www.farmland-thegame.eu/home_en.html. I am shocked by the image of an unhealthily thin and provocatively dressed young girl on the website, which seems to be completely out of context. Can the Commission please tell me what on earth it was thinking of when it created this site? Can the Commission also state how much this site cost to create? Does the Commission not see the harm in DG Health promoting images of extremely thin young girls in its publicity material?
