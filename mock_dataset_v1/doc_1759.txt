WRITTEN QUESTION E-4405/06 by Ole Christensen (PSE) to the Commission (16 October 2006) Subject: Working environment at airports Can the Commission advise whether baggage handling operations at airports in the EU are covered by common rules and whether there exist other international or similar rules laying down standards for this area of activity? The rising volume of air traffic also means a rising volume of air traffic-related activity. Baggage handling raises a series of problems relating to the working environment. In particular, the combination of very heavy suitcases often weighing 60 to 70 kg and very small storage holds imposes an extremely heavy strain on baggage handling staff who end up worn out with problems affecting various parts of the back and the body's motor system as well as with other ailments that help explain to the many cases of early retirement. Air transport is by its nature international and it is the same suitcases that are being loaded in one country and unloaded in another. The problems of the working environment also follow along and there is therefore a clear need for uniform international rules. In the light of the foregoing, can the Commission advise what EU rules exist in this area and will it itself be taking any relevant initiatives?
