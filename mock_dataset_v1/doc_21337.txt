the 2011/2012 period; 13. Emphasises the urgent need for the Member States to step up their efforts to deliver in all priority areas, including increasing employment levels and reducing unemployment, exploiting the job potential of a new low-carbon economy, developing a skilled workforce, promoting job quality and lifelong learning, and facilitating the work-life balance; considers that these efforts should be reflected in the final National Reform Programmes; 14. Emphasises, in this context, the importance of the Structural Funds, and in particular the European Social Fund, in counteracting the effects of the crisis on employment; considers that the use of these Funds should be geared to supporting the groups with most severe difficulties in entering or remaining on the labour market; 15. Considers also that, in addition to the implementation of more effective labour market measures, closer interaction between employment, social and other policy areas, in particular macroeconomic, R&D and innovation, education and training policies, is essential if the Europe 2020 goals are to be met; Step up action to deliver on more and better jobs 16. Calls on the Member States, in their National Reform Programmes, to give the highest priority to increasing labour market participation, tackling unemployment and preventing long-term exclusion from the labour market; 17. Considers that much more emphasis must be given to job quality and decent work and to supply side-oriented economic policies in an effort to boost demand on the labour market; 18. Considers, in that connection, that efforts are needed to make better use of the potential of younger people, including early school leavers, women, the elderly, disadvantaged and disabled people, migrants and members of ethnic minorities, including the Roma; calls on the Member States to adapt their labour markets to the needs and skills of these groups at every stage of their lives; 19. Stresses the importance of policies facilitating the transition of young people from school to work; stresses that the risk that early school leavers will face poverty is predictably high; emphasises that any flexible or temporary forms of work used in this context should incorporate the right to training and access to social security and should help people make the transition into more secure employment; 20. Calls on the Member States to continue developing the policies needed to bring more women on to and keep them on the labour market, including by improving the provision of affordable and high-quality care
