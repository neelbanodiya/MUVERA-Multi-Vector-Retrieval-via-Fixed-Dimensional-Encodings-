Answer given by Ms Hübner on behalf of the Commission (17 August 2007) Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, OJ L 210, 31.7.2006. aims to reduce the risk of Structural Funds being misused in cases of relocation. Member States are required to cancel or to recover any contribution from the funds in cases where an initial investment operation by a large company undergoes a substantial modification within five years from its completion. This period can be reduced to three years for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Member States inform the Commission in their annual implementing report of any substantial modification (e.g. the cessation of a productive activity) and the Commission then informs other Member States. If, following the transfer of a productive activity within a Member State or to another Member State, an undertaking is subject to a recovery procedure, the Member States and the Commission shall ensure that it does not benefit from a contribution from the funds. In accordance with Recital 42 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, an explicit decision by the Commission is required for major projects over EUR 25 million in the case of the environment or EUR 50 million in other fields (taking into account, when possible and where appropriate, the socioeconomic impact in other regions of the Community). The Commission originally intended to propose to extend the minimum period for maintaining investments by large companies to seven years. In negotiations with the Council this period was reduced to five years, in line with the state aid requirements for regional investment.
