of their scheme. Those measures may focus on improving the target group's knowledge on the fruit and vegetable sector or healthy eating habits. 4. Administration, execution and control depend to a large extent on the strategies that Member States adopt, which must be in line with EU rules. Regulation (EC) No 288/2009 lays down implementing rules, such as rules on the eligibility of products, financial and budgetary management and accompanying measures. Member States are entirely free to participate or not and decide how to organise and implement the programme, i.e. choose the target group, the products, the frequency of distribution, the level of decentralisation etc. The aid applications procedure inevitably may give rise to a certain administrative burden. However, SFS control obligations and aid applications procedure are similar to those applied for the School Milk Scheme programme, and Member States are already familiar with these rules and rather positive in respect of this experience. In November 2010, Member States will send to the Commission the results of their monitoring exercise and of the on-the-spot checks. In February 2012 they will also notify the results of their evaluation exercise. On this basis, the Commission will draft a report to the Parliament and the Council to evaluate the application of the School Fruit Scheme, accompanied by appropriate proposals, if necessary.
