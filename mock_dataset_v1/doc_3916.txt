WRITTEN QUESTION E-3615/09 by Kathy Sinnott (IND/DEM) to the Commission (18 May 2009) Subject: Right to roam and rights of way It has come to my attention that there is great disparity between the right to roam and the numbers of rights of way across Europe. Whilst this is affected by historical differences, population density and so on, there are also large differences between comparable countries, such as Ireland and Wales, or even between Ireland and England, where, despite being relatively scarcely populated, Ireland has much poorer access to rights of way. People only have the right to roam in National Parks, which constitute only 1 % of the country, and in the Coillte forests. Can the Commission comment on access to the countryside across Europe? Are there any plans for action in this area?
