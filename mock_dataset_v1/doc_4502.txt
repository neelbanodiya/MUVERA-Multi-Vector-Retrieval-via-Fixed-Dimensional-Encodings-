WRITTEN QUESTION E-2024/08 by Marco Rizzo (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (10 April 2008) Subject: Additional insurance On most airline company websites on which tickets can be purchased, the price on purchase automatically includes insurance (luggage, life, etc.). The option given is, as it were, to ‘opt out’, making it necessary to specify that one is not interested in paying costs additional to the price of the ticket. Is the Commission aware of this procedure for the sale of insurance? Does it not feel it should take action to ensure that the purchase of insurance in addition to the ticket has to be a voluntary ‘opt‑in’ choice?
