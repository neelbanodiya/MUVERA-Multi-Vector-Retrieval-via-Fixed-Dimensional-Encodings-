WRITTEN QUESTION P-5734/06 by Mia De Vits (PSE) to the Commission (22 December 2006) Subject: Drafting of reports on ‘managing change’ in European businesses In its report of 1998, the High-Level Group on Restructuring, chaired by Mr Gillenhammar, proposed that large businesses should compile annual reports on ‘managing change’. Drawing up such reports and having them discussed or approved by European works councils could have a preventive effect in avoiding dramatic restructuring operations. Both the European Parliament (resolution of 26 May 2005 on the Social Agenda for 2006‑10, P6_TA(2005)0210 ) and ETUC called on the Commission to make a proposal for requiring large businesses to draw up such annual reports. How many large businesses — and which — are drawing up such annual reports? Do they submit them to their European works councils for discussion? Will the Commission respond to Parliament's call for the compilation of such reports to be made compulsory?
