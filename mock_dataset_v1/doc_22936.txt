WRITTEN QUESTION E-6188/08 by Kyriacos Triantaphyllides (GUE/NGL) to the Council (18 November 2008) Subject: European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET) Under the joint proposal for a recommendation of the European Parliament and of the Council (COM(2008)0180) on the Establishment of a European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECVET), a common European credit system for the recognition, evaluation and validation of learning outcomes is being promoted so that skills can be transferred from one national qualifications framework to another in the EU. Will the Council say on the basis of which criteria learning outcome units will be assessed? How important will each criterion be in determining the score of learning outcome units?
