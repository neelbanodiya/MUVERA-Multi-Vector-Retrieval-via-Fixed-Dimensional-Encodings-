Answer given by Mrs Hübner on behalf of the Commission (9 June 2005) The Commission wishes to inform the Honourable Member that Itä-Suomi (Eastern Finland) will be eligible for the phasing in scheme, but will receive special financial treatment as in the case of regions eligible for statistical phasing out. For the other extremely sparsely populated areas of Northern Finland, the Commission proposes special financial treatment in addition to their normal allocation. The Commission wants to ensure that cohesion and competition policy are in line in the regions benefiting from the regional competitiveness and employment objective – including the sparsely populated northern regions of Finland. To this end it examines the compatibility between State aid rules and priority interventions in the fields of environment, research and development, transport and small and medium enterprises. This also involves the adjustment of legislation with a view to supporting the Lisbon objectives. Details concerning State aid rules, including those relating to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) regulation, are subject to ongoing negotiations.
