the current priority is to ensure that the existing Community legislation (Directive 2000/78/EC ) is fully transposed into national law. In so far as the future of Union anti-discrimination policy is concerned, the Commission intends to launch a public consultation (Green Paper) in spring 2004 on the future strategy to combat discrimination. This paper will take stock of progress made in Union anti-discrimination policy and will raise issues/questions regarding future policy development. It will also address the new challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union and will help to map out the way ahead for Union action on equality over the next five years or more.
