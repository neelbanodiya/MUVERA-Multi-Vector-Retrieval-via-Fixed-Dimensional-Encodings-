models, providing in particular for the involvement of local authorities, such as citizens’ networks and publicly run networks or those acquired using public funds, for the provision and financing of high-speed and ultra-high-speed networks as an option into the Community Guidelines for the application of State aid rules in relation to rapid deployment of broadband networks in order to make broadband functions accessible to all Europeans and ensure that urban and rural areas will be treated equally and coverage can extend to sparsely populated areas and to guarantee the same standards as regards quality, access, and pricing; 14. Points to the goal of establishing a predictable regulatory environment for investment and competition to promote investment in high-speed networks and technically and economically sound non-discriminatory access and cooperation opportunities; 15. Considers that, even at the current level of basic provision, the use of ‘digital dividend’ frequencies based on LTE technology will not solve the problem of gaps in NGA networks in rural areas in the long term, especially in view of the fact that radio communications may have long-term health effects; believes, therefore, that it would be appropriate to enable to mobilise all available EU, national and regional funding for ducts for NGA networks in these areas; giving priority to fibre optic-based broadband development, where this would be the most economical and sustainable solution in the long term;16. Takes the view that the public funding earmarked for broadband services can be an effective lever to boost the competitiveness of EU regions if it is channelled into the development of up-to-date, new-generation infrastructure with a high transmission capacity in areas that have a major broadband connection deficit; believes that such areas, in particular those with a large industrial base and a high population density, could very swiftly benefit from the innovative and creative potential of the new services available to individuals and businesses; 17. Believes that steps should be taken to promote investment projects, including in the form of public-private partnerships, for the building of open networks enabling competition to be genuinely enhanced to the benefit of technological innovation and economic development in EU regions; 18. Calls for the various financial instruments brought to bear to take due account of the specific characteristics of regions, in particular those with special economic, geographical and demographic features in terms of remoteness, inherent difficulties as regards competitive markets or a lack of economies of scale;
