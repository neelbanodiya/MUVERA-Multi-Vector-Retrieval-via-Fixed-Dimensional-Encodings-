Question for written answer E-002424/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Elisabeth Köstinger (PPE) (1 March 2012) Subject: Stepping up soya farming in the EU The European Union is faced with an extreme protein deficit and is very much dependent on imports in the area of animal feed in particular. It is well-known that protein provision focuses primarily on soya products, which are mainly made from genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and originate in the US, Argentina and Brazil. GMO-free soya farming in the EU requires, in the medium to long term, a European soya bean cultivation and research programme. What efforts are being made as part of the CAP reform to reduce Europe’s dependence on imports and to close the European protein deficit gap with EU production? What EU initiatives are there to reduce the extreme lack of animal feed protein? Are there specific initiatives in the Member States to improve protein supply? Are there initiatives to step up soya farming? If so, in which countries? What is the current position with regard to soya farming, and what are its prospects, in those EU countries that already cultivate soya? Are there research programmes for European soya bean cultivation, which would be particularly important in the medium term if the supply of GMO-free material from overseas were to end?
