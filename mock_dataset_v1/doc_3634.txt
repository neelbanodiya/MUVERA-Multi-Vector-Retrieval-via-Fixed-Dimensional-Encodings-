Question for written answer E-006927/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Giancarlo Scottà (EFD) (13 July 2011) Subject: Fruit and vegetable consumption to prevent diseases Two recent studies (published by Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention and The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition ) not only stress the importance of eating fruit and vegetables, but also highlight the need to vary consumption patterns so as to reduce the risk of lung cancer (especially in smokers) and lower plasmatic C‑reactive protein levels (this protein is a marker of inflammation and cardiovascular disease risk). Eating a variety of fruit and vegetables widens the intake of protective substances and boosts their effects. Furthermore, the Mediterranean diet, which includes many kinds of fruit and vegetables, has always been considered a useful way of combating serious diseases, for example obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disorders, and ageing. From 1 August 2009 to 31 July 2010 the Commission financed the School Fruit Scheme, in which Community aid was granted to enable participating countries to distribute fruit and vegetables to children at school. The aim of the initiative was to encourage healthy eating habits among the very young. Bearing in mind how important it is to eat fruit and vegetables, and in the light of the recent studies mentioned above, does the Commission have any information about the success of the School Fruit Scheme and will it provide further funding for similar projects? Will it, in addition, conduct a campaign to make young people and adults alike aware of the importance of fruit and vegetables and of the damage to health that can occur if they are not consumed in sufficient quantities?
