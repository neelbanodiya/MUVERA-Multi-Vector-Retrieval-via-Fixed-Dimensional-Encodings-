9999/C Q999 E/008 WRITTEN QUESTION E-0908/04 by Paolo Bartolozzi (PPE-DE) to the Commission (15 March 2004) Subject: Services of general interest A motion for a resolution was tabled in the European Parliament on 14 January 2004 on the Commission's Green Paper on services of general interest ( COM (2003) 270 ). In this document the Commission includes health among non-economic services of general interest, and defines the difference between economic and non-economic services as fundamental, since the two categories are not subject to the same Treaty provisions. It is clear that 'the future of non-economic services of general interest', including health or social services, 'raises issues on a European scale, such as the content of the European model of society'.

For these reasons the inclusion of health among non-economic services of general interest, which are 'not subject to specific Community rules, nor are they covered by the internal market (…) rules of the Treaty', seems reductive. Can the Commission say: - why health is not included among economic services of general interest, since such services are subject to common obligations which must be ensured for the public, such as universality, continuity, quality, accessibility and security; - if health is thus excluded from the process of implementing the internal market, will this not mean abandoning the objective, set by many Member States, of achieving the advantages of market efficiency without neglecting social justice, guaranteed by State guidance, control and responsibility? On what basis is health excluded from the general approach outlined in the Commission's Communication 'An internal market strategy for services'? Would not the
