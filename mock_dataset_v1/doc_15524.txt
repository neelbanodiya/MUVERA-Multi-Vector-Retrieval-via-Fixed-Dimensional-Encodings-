Question for written answer E-001289/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Charalampos Angourakis (GUE/NGL) (10 February 2012) Subject: Immigrants and refugees drowned in the Mediterranean in 2011 More than 1 500 immigrants and refugees drowned or disappeared in 2011 trying to cross the Mediterranean. According to the UNHCR, which has been gathering data since 2006, this is a record. It is obvious that the increased flow of immigrants in 2011 is directly linked to NATO’s war in Libya, a series of operations in North Africa and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a consequence of the capitalist policies of these countries, the choices made by the Union for the Mediterranean and the EU Neighbourhood Policy, all of them seeking profit while exacerbating everyday poverty and misery. Can the Commission confirm the UNCHR’s data regarding immigration in the Mediterranean and does it recognise the right of the people of North Africa to steer a development course serving their own interests rather than those of big business, so that they no longer need to risk their lives attempting to migrate?
