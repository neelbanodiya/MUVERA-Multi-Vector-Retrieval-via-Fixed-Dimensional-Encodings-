WRITTEN QUESTION E-1835/07 by Koenraad Dillen (ITS) to the Commission (10 April 2007) Subject: Angolan paramilitaries in Zimbabwe According to Zimbabwe's Minister of Home Affairs, Mr Kembo Mohadi, some 2 500 Angolan paramilitaries are being deployed against opponents of the regime in his country. Mr Mohadi says himself that he has concluded an agreement on the subject with Angola's Minister of Home Affairs, General Roberto Monteiro. These paramilitaries are known in their own country as ‘ninjas’ and are feared because of their merciless cruelty (Jan Raath, ‘Angola sends “Ninja” paramilitaries to bolster Mugabe's security forces’, The Times , 22 March 2007). Article 9(2) of the Cotonou Agreement of 23 June 2000 lays down that respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law shall underpin the domestic and international policies of the Parties and constitute ‘essential elements’ of the Agreement. Article 96 lays down that, if a Party considers that the other Party has failed to fulfil an obligation stemming from respect for human rights, it may supply the other Party or the Council of Ministers with the relevant information with a view to seeking a solution. If no solution proves possible, ‘appropriate measures’ may be taken. Is the Commission aware of the above agreement? Does the Commission consider that Angola is violating its obligations under the Cotonou Agreement? If not, why not? If so, what steps will the Commission take to enforce the Cotonou Agreement?
