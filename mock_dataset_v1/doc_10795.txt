the transport of goods, aid for the operation of combined transport should be authorised, in accordance with the Treaty, and exempt from any obligation to give prior notification. Amendment 13 Recital 16 (16) Aid granted under this Regulation is notifiable in accordance with Article 87(3) EC Treaty and Council Regulation (EC) 659/99 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 93 (new 88) of the Treaty, except where this Regulation provides otherwise. (16) Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 6 , aid granted under this Regulation is notifiable in accordance with Article 87(3) of the Treaty and Regulation (EC) No 659/ 1999 . Amendment 14 Recital 17 (17) Aid for the management, maintenance or provision of infrastructure other than combined transport, inland waterway and road terminals which forms an integral part of an existing open transport network having a single infrastructure manager can be monitored effectively by the Commission on the basis of a periodic general information requirement rather than a specific pre-notification requirement. (17) Aid for the management, maintenance , realisation or provision of infrastructure other than user-specific infrastructure can be monitored effectively by the Commission on the basis of a periodic general information requirement rather than a specific pre-notification requirement. Amendment 15 Recital 18 (18) However, in the case of aid for the management, maintenance or provision of the aforementioned terminals, or where the infrastructure concerned has a manager separate from the network manager, or where its capacity is wholly or partly reserved to one or more transport undertakings (as opposed to the granting of an access right on open infrastructure) , there may be a greater impact on competition and therefore the pre-notification requirement should not be removed. (18) However, in the case of aid for management, maintenance, realisation or provision, where the infrastructure is reserved for the use of a specific undertaking, provided that the aid ceiling exceeds an amount defined by the Commission , there may be a greater impact on competition and therefore the pre-notification requirement should not be removed. Amendment 16 Recital 19 a (new) (19a) The Commission should monitor aid, regardless of whether the aid is notified beforehand or documented afterwards, in order to ensure that competition amongst transport modes and amongst Member States and regions is not distorted. When carrying out the relevant checks, the Commission should pay particular attention to the effects of different rates of aid. Amendment
