Question for written answer E-004750/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Nuno Teixeira (PPE) (18 May 2011) Subject: Inclusion of multi-fund programmes in future cohesion policy In its 21 February 2011 conclusions on the fifth report on economic, social and territorial cohesion, the Council asked the Commission to look at the possibility of using multifunding programmes. The current funding system for European cohesion policy is structured so that elements of the same policy come under different programmes and are monitored by different managing authorities, allowing for the possible use of co-funding as required and recognising the future need to encourage greater synergy amongst the various funds in a more integrated and flexible manner in order to render the policy more effective. Mono-funding as a model runs counter to the whole principle of decentralising European regional policy and may lead to a gradual disintegration of its structure. European regional policy calls for a more practical approach, which will, in future, need to adopt a more integrated outlook, based and focused on results and aimed at achieving greater simplicity and more efficient interaction by the various structural funds. Could the Commission say how and in what form it may be possible to consider multi-fund programmes for Member States and regions wishing to make use of them, from the start of the next post-2013 programming period?
