promote access from early ages until higher education level (participation in kindergarten, second chance programmes, employment of school mediators, special places for Roma at high school and university level) and quality of education (teacher trainings, employment of Roma teachers, development of multicultural school curriculum); — health: promote access to health services (employment of health mediators to facilitate registration with family doctors); — employment: promote access to employment (participation in vocational training courses and job fairs for Roma). The main financial instrument aiming at the integration of Roma is the ESF, particularly through the Sector Operational Programme for Human Resources Development. Following successive calls for proposals launched by the Ministry of Labour, potential applicants showed a great interest in implementing projects targeting Roma people. These translated into a relatively significant budget (around EUR 83 million from ESF) having been committed by the end of 2010 for actions in favour of Roma. They correspond to 31 signed contracts.
