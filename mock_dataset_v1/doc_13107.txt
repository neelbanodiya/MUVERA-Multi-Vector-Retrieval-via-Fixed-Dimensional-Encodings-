ORAL QUESTION H-0410/05 for Question Time at the part-session in June 2005 pursuant to Rule 109 of the Rules of Procedure by Proinsias De Rossa to the Commission Subject: Establishment of national enforcement bodies to protect air passenger rights Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of 11 February 2004 'establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding or cancellation or long delays in flights' , which entered into effect on 17 February 2005, provides for the establishment of national enforcement bodies to protect air passenger rights. As of 4 May 2005, the Commission indicated that Ireland and three other Member States - Sweden, Luxembourg and Malta - had yet to notify it of the establishment of national enforcement bodies. Could the Commission confirm that it has already initiated infringement proceedings against these Member States and outline what their responses have been so far? What action will the Commission take to ensure the full and correct implementation of this Regulation? OJ L 46, 17.2.2004, p. 1
