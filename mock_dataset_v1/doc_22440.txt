Question for Question Time H-0404/2010 to the Commission Part-session: September II 2010 Rule 116 Marc Tarabella (S&D) Subject: Impact of the liberalisation of the energy market on consumers At the last Citizens’ Energy Forum the Commission pledged publicly to improve services to consumers. Yet all recently published surveys show that this market is totally lacking in transparency for consumers and that it has undergone price rises that are totally incompatible with healthy competition. What measures does the Commission intend to take to ensure that energy bills finally become transparent and to allow the public to compare prices? Why does it refuse to enforce compliance by the energy industry with the strict, precise terms of a charter which would reduce the astronomical number of complaints from the victims of liberalisation?
