Question for written answer E-009327/2011 to the Commission Rule 117 Michail Tremopoulos (Verts/ALE) (19 October 2011) Subject: Recycling of plastics containing polyolefin A study by the consultancy Consultic found that only 23 % of plastics containing polyolefin that are collected in the EU are recycled http://www.endseurope.com/27229/trade-body-calls-for-greater-polyolefin-recycling?referrer=bulletin&DCMP=EMC-ENDS-EUROPE-DAILY . This was due to a lack of adequate collection schemes and the fact that it is still possible to landfill plastic waste at a low cost. What initiatives is the Commission studying with a view to limiting the possibilities for the landfill of plastic waste, improving systems for sorting waste and extending collection schemes to cover all rigid packaging?
