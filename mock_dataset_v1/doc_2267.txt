Question for written answer E-8852/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Alfredo Pallone (PPE) (28 October 2010) Subject: Excessive consumption of the earth's natural resources With a view to the tenth international Conference on Biological Diversity which will start in Nagoya on 18 October 2010, our planet's situation still seems to be a cause for serious concern due to its current imbalance. The conclusion of the report ‘Living Planet 2010’ leaves no hope: we are currently exploiting the earth's resilience and absorption capacity to improve our standard of living and consumption by using more resources than are available. We are consuming natural resources faster than ecosystems are able to regenerate them and we are emitting more greenhouse gases than the earth can absorb. However, this ‘ecological footprint’ shows clearly and eloquently the great divide between nations, highlighting once again the serious imbalance between rich and poor nations, at the expense of the latter. The economies of developed countries, in fact, ‘discharge’ their global impact onto the ecosystems of poor, more vulnerable countries, without taking into account the fact that it is precisely in those areas that most of our planet's biological reserve can be found. In the light of the above, does the Commission not think it should take action to try to reduce the imbalance between ‘rich and “poor”? Does it not also think it should ensure that the European Union, even without the agreement of the other world powers, moves forward in implementing policies designed to save natural resources and foster sustainable consumption?
