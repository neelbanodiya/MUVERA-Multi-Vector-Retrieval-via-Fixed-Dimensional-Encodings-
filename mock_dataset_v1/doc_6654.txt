Question for written answer E-7695/2010 to the Commission Rule 117 Nikolaos Salavrakos (EFD) (28 September 2010) Subject: Difficulties encountered by Russian citizens wishing to obtain a visa On 1 June 2007 an agreement was signed between Russia and the Commission aimed at facilitating the procedures for granting visas to European and Russian citizens. However, in spite of the undertakings given by the competent authorities of the European Union regarding the abolition of visas for Russian tourists visiting European countries in 2010, the practical difficulties encountered in obtaining visas discourage tourist travel and make it less attractive for Russians to invest. A document drawn up by the Serres Chamber of Commerce addressed to Greek political leaders and the Commission reports that official Russian statistics show a drop of around 10 % in the number of tourists travelling from Russia to Greece and a simultaneous rise of around 25 % in tourist travel to countries outside the EU such as Turkey, Egypt and Israel. 1. In the context of the European neighbourhood policy, and bearing the above situation in mind, what immediate action will the Commission take to facilitate the granting of visas in countries such as Russia, given that tourism is a basic pillar of the national economy? 2. Given that the simplification and future abolition of visa requirements between Russia and the EU is now an imperative, and economic expediency is both a necessity and in the interests of both parties, will the Commission take steps aimed at speeding up this procedure in the immediate future?
