WRITTEN QUESTION E-0896/08 by Cătălin-Ioan Nechifor (PSE) to the Commission (25 February 2008) Subject: Current state of absorption — Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund The EU's objectives regarding the above funds placed at the disposal of the Member States, which represent some 80 % of all Union funds, are: convergence, regional competitiveness, job creation, and, finally, territorial cooperation. In this connection, the financial allocations for the period 2007‑13 should already be yielding results, since it is now more than one year since the present programming period began. Unfortunately, the Member States have not yet managed to adapt to the new procedures, and precious time is being lost each day for sustainable economic and social development and the reduction of regional inequalities in the Union. In these conditions, what is the absorption percentage for both the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund for each of the EU Member States? Secondly, what measures does the Commission favour to ensure the fulfilment of the Union's major objectives in those cases where the absorption rate proves to be low or even (in some instances) to stand at zero?
