WRITTEN QUESTION E-4618/06 by Marielle De Sarnez (ALDE) to the Commission (26 October 2006) Subject: Access to higher education for European nationals Despite the principle that nationals of one Member State must be accorded access to education in another Member State on the same terms as nationals of the latter country, several Member States have in recent years been resorting to forms of selection, by competitive examination, by lot, or by restricting intake, specifically where European nationals are concerned. Given that such practices violate the principle of free movement of students, can the Commission say what steps it intends to take?
