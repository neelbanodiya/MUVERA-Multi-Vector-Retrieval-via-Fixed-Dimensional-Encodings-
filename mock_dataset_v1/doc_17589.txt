in international environment policy and in setting the agenda for international cooperation; 7. Is convinced that public health should be considered as an essential part of the Lisbon agenda, as it contributes directly to the economic performance of Member States and the competitiveness of the EU as a whole; considers it therefore vital to allocate more resources to the public health policy area; 8. Considers that it is extremely important to anticipate potential health threats in a coordinated manner in the EU and agree on joint risk management measures; welcomes therefore the preparatory action related to public health designed to enhance preparedness in relation to various health threats, such as influenza pandemic, SARS and bio-terrorism; calls for adequate funding for the preparatory action in 2006 so that a solid basis for further work within the new Public Health Programme can be established as quickly as possible; 9. Urges the Commission and the Council to initiate a procedure to review the weightings used to reconcile the differences in cost of living in Member States, in particular for Sweden, and to adjust them if appropriate to local conditions.
