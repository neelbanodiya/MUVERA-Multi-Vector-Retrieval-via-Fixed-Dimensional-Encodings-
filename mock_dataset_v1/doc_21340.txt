Answer given by Ms Kroes on behalf of the Commission (11 October 2010) The media have recently reported on Trust and Security initiatives launched by the Digital Agenda for Europe and have started referring to them as a ‘Rapid response system to Cyber-attacks.’ Indeed, the Trust and security area of the Digital Agenda for Europe COM(2010)245 final. announces the presentation of ‘measures allowing faster reactions in the event of cyber attacks.’ This will include a network of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) in Europe, to be established before 2012, as well as the establishment of a CERT for the EU institutions. Both Key Action 6 and 7 respectively announce initiatives aiming at enabling Europe to react more quickly to cyber attacks. On 30 September 2010, the Commission adopted proposals to modernise the European Network and Information Security Agency as well as to combat cyber attacks against information systems. In addition, other initiatives involve measures on cyber-security exercises, and large scale attacks simulations. The timeframe set by the Digital Agenda for Europe for the presentation of these initiatives spans from 2010 to 2013.
