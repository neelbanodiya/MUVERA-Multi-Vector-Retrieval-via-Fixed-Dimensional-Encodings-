Answer given by Mr Almunia on behalf of the Commission (17 June 2005) The Leadership Group (LEG) on culture statistics operated between 1997 and 2000 and its final report is available as a Eurostat working paper (nr 3/2000/E/No 1). This report together with all results of publishable quality and other links relevant for International Culture Statistics are available on the Internet site on Culture Statistics maintained by the Eurostat unit responsible for education and culture at the following address: http://forum.europa.eu.int/Public/irc/dsis/edtcs/library?l=/public/culture&vm=detailed&sb=Title The work in the area of culture statistics has continued after the end of the LEG in the framework of the Eurostat Working Group ‘Culture Statistics’ and its three task forces, led by France and Italy, on employment, participation and expenditure. These task forces completed their work in 2004 with the publication of three distinct reports which have not yet been made available to the general public. On the basis of the work of the Task Force Employment the first ever results on cultural employment in Europe were released by Eurostat in the form of a press release in May 2004 (No 68‑2004), also available on the website mentioned above. A first attempt has also been made to collect harmonised data on public expenditure based on common concepts, definitions and methodologies but the results were not considered of sufficient quality to be published. For the forthcoming period the wish is to establish a sustainable system of production of culture statistics, also including the area of cultural industries. However, the continuation of work in this field will depend on the needs identified in the framework of the development of new Community actions in the domain of culture and the relevant monitoring and reporting requirements. No calculation of the impact of the Culture 2000 programme has been carried out to date, and there are no plans for such an evaluation in the future.
