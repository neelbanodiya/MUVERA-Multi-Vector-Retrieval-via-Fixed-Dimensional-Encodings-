WRITTEN QUESTION E-3203/10 by Gesine Meissner (ALDE) to the Council (7 May 2010) Subject: COM(2002)0064: VAT proposal concerning travel agents I has come to our attention that under the Spanish Presidency, the EU Member States are asked to re-examine the Commission proposal of 2002 (COM(2002)0064 OJ C 126E, 28.5.2002, p. 390. ), regarding the special regime for the application of VAT to supplies offered by travel agents and tour operators Parliament delivered a positive opinion in 2002 with two recommended amendments, one of which was taken on board in the version sent to the Council. However, no agreement was reached between the various Member States and the dossier has not been discussed in Council again since. Following a first discussion in a Council working group on 3 February, it has come to our attention that the Council is aiming at amending the proposal significantly beyond the current text. The next meeting of the Council Working group on the issue is planned for 28 April 2010 to discuss this amended proposal. 1. Can the Council indicate when it plans to re-consult Parliament on this amended proposal, as requested by Parliament in its opinion on the proposal in 2002? 2. What procedure is the Council planning to follow, and what is the timeline the Council has in mind for the adoption of this adapted version of the 2002 proposal?
