Question for written answer P-001942/2012 to the Commission Rule 117 Gilles Pargneaux (S&D) (20 February 2012) Subject: EGF intervention in support of farmers On 6 October 2011, the Commission adopted a series of proposals on implementing EU cohesion policy for the 2014-2020 period, for which it proposes to allocate EUR 336 billion. In this context, the Commission has also tabled a proposal for a regulation concerning the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for which farmers facing the impact of new trade agreements concluded by the European Union might be eligible. The Commission’s budget proposals for 2014-2020 provide for a maximum of EUR 2.8 billion to be made available for the agricultural sector within the framework of the EGF. Can the Commission confirm that this aid could be allocated to European farmers facing the consequences of a trade agreement, such as the agreement the EU will conclude with Morocco on agricultural and fisheries products?
