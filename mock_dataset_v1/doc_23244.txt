WRITTEN QUESTION E-2761/06 by Proinsias De Rossa (PSE) to the Council (21 June 2006) Subject: Ban on imports of cat and dog fur With regard to the press release (PRES/06/39) issued after the 2708 th Council Meeting, Agriculture and Fisheries, in Brussels on 20 February 2006 on the Commission's proposal for a Community action plan on the protection and welfare of animals (2006‑10), which delegation expressed support for a ‘wider Community initiative on the transport of animals and on an EU ban on imports of cat and dog fur’? Can it be taken therefore that the other delegations did not express support for a possible EU ban on imports of cat and dog fur, which the Commission is due to present by the end of June 2006? What is the Council's current thinking on this issue?
