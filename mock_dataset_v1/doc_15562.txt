Answer given by Mr Barnier on behalf of the Commission (1 June 2010) In response to the question of the Honourable Member, the Commission would like to recall that eurozone membership does not entail the abolishment of national card schemes. When an issuing bank chooses however to participate in the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) project, their debit card schemes need to be compliant with the SEPA Card Framework (SCF). One of the objectives of this framework is to allow consumers to use national general purpose payment cards, such as Dankort, throughout the whole EU. The Honourable Member can find more information on SEPA on the following portal website: http://www.ecb.int/paym/sepa/html/links.en.html
