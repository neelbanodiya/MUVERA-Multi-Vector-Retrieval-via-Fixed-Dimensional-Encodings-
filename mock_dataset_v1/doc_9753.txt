of measures to increase reporting to the authorities of violence against women, children and young people and different forms of trade in women and children for sexual exploitation; d) promotion of publicity campaigns, using the mass media, focusing on the condemnation of violence and the provision of support for victims in the form of psychological, moral and practical assistance. The design of materials to supplement those already available, or their adaptation for use in other geographical areas or for other target groups will be encouraged. II. COMPLEMENTARY ACTIONS In order to ensure that all areas of the programme are fully covered, even in the absence of proposals - or suitable proposals - for a given area, the Commission will carry out more proactive activities to fill any gaps. Consequently, the programme will finance complementary actions, on the Commission's initiative, in the following areas, inter alia: a) the development of indicators on violence, so that the quantified impact of policies and projects can be measured. This should be based on existing experience and strengthened by means of a permanent monitoring mechanism to record progress and identify gaps relating to all forms of violence against women; b) the establishment of a procedure for regular and sustainable data collection, preferably with the assistance of Eurostat, in order to be able to quantify violence in the Union more accurately; c) the setting up, in conjunction with Interpol and Europol, of a European database for missing persons which would include specifically recorded details of missing persons believed to be the victims of traffickers; d) the extraction and deduction of policy issues, wherever possible, from the work achieved by funded projects, with the aim of suggesting common policies on violence at Community level and reinforcing judicial practice; e) the establishment of a think-tank to provide guidelines and orientations to the Commission on the social, cultural and political context in order to facilitate the priorities for the selection of projects and complementary actions. The think-tank would be composed of representatives of the European Parliament's competent committee and include representatives of major non-governmental organisations in the field of violence; f) the analysis/evaluation of the projects financed in order to prepare for a European year against violence; g. g ) to dissemination, on a Europe-wide scale, of good practices stemming from funded projects ; this can be achieved by various means: 1) producing and distributing written material, CD-ROMs, video
