WRITTEN QUESTION E-2303/07 by Justas Vincas Paleckis (PSE) to the Commission (30 April 2007) Subject: Uptake of funding for the development of the information society The uptake of financial support from the EU structural funds for the development of the information society for the period 2004‑06 has been sluggish in the majority of the new EU Member States. The main reasons for this are the passivity of project developers, resulting from an administratively complex project preparation mechanism and evaluation procedure, and a lack of qualified specialists. If this trend continues in the future, it will jeopardise the effective use of EU support for the development of the information society in 2007‑13 and make it impossible to achieve the desired objectives and results, to make up the gap between many of the new Member States and other EU countries in terms of users’ aptitudes and the development of information technology and infrastructure, and to implement high standards relating to the quality and accessibility of electronic services. What changes would the Commission propose in order to ensure that funding for the development of the information society is taken up effectively? How would the Commission propose to solve the problem of a lack of specialists, which is caused mainly by the migration of specialists to wealthier EU countries? The existence of these trends in the new Member States, including Lithuania, explains the lack of specialists able to prepare information society development projects.
