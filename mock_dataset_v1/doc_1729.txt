WRITTEN QUESTION E-3439/07 by Sajjad Karim (ALDE) to the Commission (5 July 2007) Subject: Voluntary instruments and environmentally preferable products Does the Commission agree that voluntary instruments, such as eco-labels or geographical indications, have the potential to help developing countries enhance their market penetration and facilitate specific niches for environmentally preferable products (EPPs)? Does the Commission agree that production and promotion of EPPs or products based on traditional knowledge, which are often produced by rural communities, can also contribute to poverty reduction? Does the Commission agree that taking advantage of these opportunities, however, often involves high investment, well adapted marketing tools and knowledge of potential export markets but that, in practice, few countries have the capacity to promote such forms of sustainable trade without long- term and well-targeted technical assistance and capacity building (TACB)? If so, what proportion of the EU's TACB budget is targeted towards encouraging and facilitating such forms of sustainable trade?
