Agreement with Japan, which is a full-fledged mutual legal assistance agreement as no prior bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties existed between any of the Member States and Japan, renders explicit what is implicit in the EU‑US Agreement: Article 11(1)(b) of the EU‑Japan Agreement states that the requested State may consider that the execution of a request concerning an offence punishable by death could prejudice essential interests of the requested State, unless the requested State and the requesting State agree on the conditions under which the request can be executed.
