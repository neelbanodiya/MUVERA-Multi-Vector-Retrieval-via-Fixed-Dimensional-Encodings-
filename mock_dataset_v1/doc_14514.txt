9999/C Q999 E/201 WRITTEN QUESTION E-2523/03 by Erik Meijer (GUE/NGL) to the Commission (17 July 2003) Subject: Validity for other parts of the EU of the successful Flemish model for expanding public transport, winning new passengers and providing services on a sound financial basis 1. Is the Commission aware that – partly as a result of efforts to reduce taxes and government spending – with the rise of the car loss-making public transport has been steadily declining and losing passengers and that, as a result, transport links to and road safety and the quality of life in villages and suburbs have suffered, whilst urbanisation, pollution and traffic problems have increased? 2. Is the Commission aware, further, that in the Belgian federal State of Flanders the urban and regional transport company De Lijn has succeeded in reversing this downward trend in the EU: over the last four years, passenger numbers have increased by 47%, and the figure for the period since 1990 is over 50%? 3. Is the Commission aware that these excellent results have been achieved by means of the following measures: (a) since 1998 fares have been simplified and lowered; (b) a decree has been issued laying down people's right to basic mobility: as from 2006, anyone living in a residential area must have a bus or tram stop within 500 to 750 metres of their home and services must run at least hourly in rural areas and five times per hour in built-up areas; (c) a number of target groups, such as young people, the elderly and inhabitants of the town of Hasselt, have access to free public transport; (d) in addition to the standard package offered by De Lijn, municipalities may buy in from a special menu additional services or fare reductions for target groups; (e) collective season tickets are sold to firms for their staff as an alternative to the reimbursement of individual travel expenses, with employees' partners also receiving a free season ticket; (f) De Lijn plays an active role in preparing policy decisions and in hiring small competitors to provide 50% of bus services? 4. Is the Commission prepared to draw the attention of other competent authorities in the EU to the success of the Flemish model and to remove obstacles which might prevent such authorities from following the Flemish example?
