Detailed provisions on controls on public procurement are applied in this framework. As regards humanitarian aid granted by the Member States, the Commission is not at this stage aware of problems linked to the way Member States organize tender procedures. As far as Community humanitarian aid is concerned, the Commission has adopted, as stipulated by Article 238(3) of the Financial Regulation's Implementing Rules, specific procurement procedures, which are contained in Annex V of the Framework Partnership Agreement applicable to humanitarian operations. These procedures share the objectives of economy and efficiency with other external actions (best value for money, price-quality ratio, absence of conflict of interests). However, they introduce a certain degree of flexibility linked to the specific nature of humanitarian aid. These new rules have been favourably received by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) community as a major improvement as compared to the previous practices.
