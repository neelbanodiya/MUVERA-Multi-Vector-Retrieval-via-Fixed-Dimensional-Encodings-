Procedure, C. whereas two pre-conciliation meetings between delegations of the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets took place on 25 March 2009 and 16 April 2009 during which a number of key issues were discussed by the two delegations, 1. Recalls that the general direction of the 2010 budget and the challenges to which it should respond were outlined in its abovementioned resolution of 10 March 2009 on the budgetary guidelines; highlights particularly that optimal and equal access to language facilities for members and actions related to Parliament's enhanced legislative role will constitute fundamental elements of the 2010 budget; General Framework 2. Notes that the overall level of the 2010 budget, as suggested by the Bureau, would stay below the traditional voluntary share of 20% of heading 5 (administrative expenditure) of the multi-annual financial framework; notes that the rate of increase suggested is above 4% and that the resulting overall level would be marginally higher than in 2009 at 19.74% of appropriations under this heading; 3. Decides that at this stage, the overall level of the budget is EUR 1 571 512 726, which represents a rate of increase of 2.72 %, in order to leave a better margin of manoeuvre for the new parliament in the autumn as well as seeking to make all possible savings; decides to maintain the contingency reserve at the same level as in 2009 (EUR 10 million); 4. Is of the opinion, given the multi-annual character of most expenditure items and main projects initiated within the institution, that better medium-term planning needs to be considered for its budget and be made more transparent; considers it very important that the full budget proposal, or at least the vast majority of it, be presented at the estimates stage in the spring and considers that the use of so-called 'amending letters' in the autumn must be limited to truly unforeseen events and/or technical updates; 5. Emphasises that timely cooperation between the Bureau and Committee on Budgets in jointly clarifying the budgetary consequences of decisions to be taken should be a fundamental part of how it deals with all major issues, while maintaining the formal prerogatives of each body; 6. Welcomes the prolongation of the pilot project on enhanced cooperation between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets for a second year and recalls that the principles of trust and transparency are essential; warns against any tendency whereby
