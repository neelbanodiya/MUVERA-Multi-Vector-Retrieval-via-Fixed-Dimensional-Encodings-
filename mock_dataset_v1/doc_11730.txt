WRITTEN QUESTION E-6128/09 by Daciana Octavia Sârbu (S&D) to the Commission (8 December 2009) Subject: Sustainable development and public procurement Public procurement in Member States accounts for billions of euros worth of contracts every year, and a significant proportion of GDP. There is huge potential for these contracts to promote and ensure sustainable development objectives which contribute to environmental protection, yet the public procurement rules adopted by the EU can be interpreted by some governments and contractors as an obstacle to pursuing these objectives. There is concern that the application of sustainable development criteria may be used as a form of protectionism because it encourages contractors to ‘buy local’. Similarly, some contractors may avoid sustainable development objectives because of an assumed risk of contravening competition law. Does the Commission recognise the potential for sustainable development to be achieved through public procurement contracts, and will the Commission consider producing guidelines to clarify how the inclusion of sustainable development objectives in such contracts is compatible with EU rules on public procurement and fair competition in the internal market?
