achieve the objectives set by the Lisbon European Council, 1. Welcomes the Commission's Action Plan, defining a series of concrete and interconnected actions for the immediate implementation of nanosciences and nanotechnologies, based on priority areas determined according to future needs; 2. Recognizes the important role that nanosciences and nanotechnologies can play as breakthrough technologies in stimulating the achievement of the economic, social, and environmental goals of the EU; acknowledges that nanotechnologies can address the needs of citizens (public health, energy, transport, sustainable development, etc), as well as contribute to the EU's competitiveness and sustainable development objectives; 3. Notes that Technology Platforms, Expert Advisory Groups, and Action Plans are useful instruments for helping to develop commonly agreed research agendas and deployment strategies in the field of nanotechnologies and nanosciences, and thereby creating new jobs and enhancing economic growth; 4. Supports the objectives and initiatives set out in the above-mentioned Commission Communication; welcomes the clear focus in the Communication and Action Plan; 5. At the same time, stresses the need to increase publicly funded investment in R&D; realises that the fragmented nature of the European research landscape reflects the easy availability and relatively low cost of nanoscience research, but is also aware that funds need to be set aside for the establishment and maintenance of the necessary large-scale facilities including, in particular clean rooms, lithographic processes and very costly analytical procedures; in this respect, expresses its concern with the current level of European public investment in nanosciences and nanotechnologies, recommends that the ambitions set out in the Action Plan will be appropriately matched in financial terms and supports the Commission's readiness to very substantially increase the resources devoted to research in this field, which is of fundamental importance to Europe's future development; 6. Considers that Europe needs a coherent system of world-class R&D infrastructure in order for the EU to remain competitive in the field of nanosciences and nanotechnologies; draws attention to the fact that, in order to enjoy possible 'economies of scale' and owing to its interdisciplinary and complex nature, the infrastructure for R&D in nanotechnologies requires a critical mass of resources that are beyond the means of local governments and industry; recognizes, on the other hand, that smaller-scale national R&D policies may often be in a better position to react adequately to changing opportunities and market developments; therefore, urges the Commission and the Member States to reinforce and coordinate their
