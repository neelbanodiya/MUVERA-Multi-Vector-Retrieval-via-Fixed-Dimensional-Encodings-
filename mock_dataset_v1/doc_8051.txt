WRITTEN QUESTION E-5784/07 by Raül Romeva i Rueda (Verts/ALE) to the Commission (23 November 2007) Subject: Spain On 13 November 2007, the Spanish courts declared that both the cartoonists responsible for the drawing on the cover of issue No 1573 of the magazine El Jueves were guilty of insulting the Spanish Royal Family, and were liable to a fine of EUR 3 000 each. The judge argued that the cover’s contents were objectively insulting, in terms of both the drawing, which shows the prince and princess naked in an explicit sexual posture, and of the accompanying text. The Public Prosecutor had described it as denigrating and defamatory, and a clear attack on the Prince’s honour, which meant that it constituted a crime of lèse-majesté. The legal proceedings began with the complaint lodged by the Public Prosecutor’s office following the publication of the magazine, which led to its being confiscated by court order and removed from all news kiosks throughout Spain. In light of the foregoing, how does the Commission evaluate these facts, which have led to the opening of court proceedings? In the light of the principle of freedom of expression, which is included in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, does the Commission not think that these events infringe this right? Has the Commission taken any steps in this connection, or will it be doing so?
