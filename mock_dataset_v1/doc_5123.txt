Answer given by Ms Damanaki on behalf of the Commission (2 March 2012) The proposal for the reform of the common fisheries policy includes the development of aquaculture among its key objectives because of its potential to contribute to economic development and job creation. It is proposed to develop an open method of coordination based on EU strategic guidelines and multiannual national strategic plans. The guidelines will aim at improving the competitiveness of aquaculture and supporting its development and innovation; encouraging economic activity; diversifying and improving the quality of life in coastal and rural areas. In the proposed reform of Common Market Organisation for fisheries and aquaculture products (CMO) a strong focus is put on the organisation of the sector in fisheries and in aquaculture. It is believed that much can be achieved in terms of added value and prices by improving the way production is planned, market analysis and marketing of products are conducted. The Commission proposes to strengthen and support producers' organisation in aquaculture. The Commission agrees that an increased diversity of offer would release some pressure on some species that are overexploited. Availability of large number of different commercial species from catch fisheries and aquaculture is an opportunity to extend the range of sustainable quality products in the EU. Support to marketing activities, differentiation, certification and promotion of diversification of offer is referred to in the Commission proposal for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.
